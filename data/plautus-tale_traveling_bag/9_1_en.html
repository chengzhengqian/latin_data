<span class="italic">the ring of Soteris, Aspasius recognizes the seal, and Dinia and
Gorgines are discovered to be the fathers of Nicodemus and
Soteris, respectively. Fr. xvii–xix are difficult
to situate within
the play. Fr. xvii describes
a slave who will steal from his master
in order to support his master’s son. Fr. xviii is too general
to be located with any certainty. And all that can be said about
fr. xix is that the person who removes lice is not identical with
the person having lice, but again the absence of context makes
it problematic.</span></p>
