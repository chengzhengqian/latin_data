Not much seems to have been lost at its beginning.</span></span>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">nic</span></span> What do you say? May I?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> By all means, if you need anything. But what’s the matter?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">nic</span></span> I’ve heard you say that you want to hire a laborer for your
country estate.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> You’ve heard correctly.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">nic</span></span> What sort of work do you want done?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Why do you care about that? Have you been assigned to
me as my guardian?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">nic</span></span> I think I can give you a sufficiently
good laborer.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Do you have any slave that you can let out for a wage?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">nic</span></span> i have no slaves. This is how it comes
about that I’m hiring
myself out to you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> (<span class="italic">looking him over</span>) What about you? Please, have you
ever hired yourself out to anyone? Well, I for one don’t
think you’re a paid worker.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">nic</span></span> I’m not, at least if you don’t
want to give me any pay. But<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>
if you are prepared to give me wages, take me along with
you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Young man, life in the country is hard.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">nic</span></span> Poverty in the city is quite a bit more so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">din</span></span> Your hands are used to throwing dice.</p></div>
