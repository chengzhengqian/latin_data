<p><span class="italic">As the scene heading shows, what followed the prologue was a
monologue by Aspasius. Of this prologue only the first line has
been preserved.</span></p>

Probably immediately after the monologue by Aspasius there
was a dialogue between Nicodemus and Gorgines, in which the
former told the latter about his fate; possibly the dialogue was
overheard by Aspasius. Fr. i–iv<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_401_2" id="target_note_LCL328_401_2"><sup>2</sup></a> seem to be part of the dialogue.
In fr. i Nicodemus tells Gorgines about the shipwreck and in fr.
ii about his wretched situation and grief for his lost girlfriend.
Leo, who compares fr. iii with Rud. 282, demonstrates that fr.
iii was probably spoken by Gorgines, who invites Nicodemus
to stay, despite being poor himself. In fr. iv Gorgines shows
Nicodemus the surroundings.</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">The fragmentary ll. 17 a–17<sup>g</sup> are incomprehensible. Intelligible
text begins 56 verses later. Somewhere in this lost piece there
must have been a scene in which Cacistus finds out about Nicodemus’
lot and another scene in which Nicodemus overhears
that Dinia is looking for a worker.</span></p>
