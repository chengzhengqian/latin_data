the men of old, yet it is not a small number, who have lost their following, who represent their country and constitute the senate. The attachment they cherish is maintained only by the will of individuals, and those now few and far between; the nation’s wishes oppose them and with multitudinous dissent condemn their restless murmuring. If in olden days the decrees of the conscript fathers could only stand if it was on record that three hundred senators were agreed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_396_a" id="target_note_LCL387_396_a"><sup>a</sup></a> let us keep to our fathers’ laws: let the minority’s feeble voice give way and fall silent in their little section.</p>
