Such are the delights of the Jupiter of the dead,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_380_b" id="target_note_LCL387_380_b"><sup>b</sup></a> such the acts in which the ruler of dark Avernus finds content and refreshment. Is it not shameful that a strong imperial nation thinks it needful to offer such sacrifices for its country’s welfare, and seeks the help of religion from the vaults of hell? With blood, alas, it calls up the minister of death from his dark abode to present him with a splendid offering of dead men. Vain is now our wonted condemnation of the Tauric rites<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_380_c" id="target_note_LCL387_380_c"><sup>c</sup></a>: human blood is shed at the Latin god’s festival and the assembled onlookers there pay savage offerings at the altar of their own Pluto. What more holy than an altar which drinks blood drawn by ritual weapons? Do you waver in your belief that there exists, in the blind darkness below, the god for whom you grope amid the silent shades? See there! Why do you deny that the spirits of the dead are counted divine, when your fathers’ very monuments prove it? I read there marble slabs inscribed “To the divine spirit of the dead,” wherever the Latin or the Salarian road guards the old ashes in their thickly planted tombs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_380_d" id="target_note_LCL387_380_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Tell me, to whom do you carve this inscription, but that you revere the throne of grim Orcus as though it were the seat of real majesty?</p>
<p>Such are the rites, drawn from the early days of our ancestors, which entangled and defiled the imperial abode of supreme power, when an emperor who had twice been victorious and slain two usurpers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_380_ea" id="target_note_LCL387_380_ea"><sup>e</sup></a> turned his eyes in triumph on her noble battlements.
