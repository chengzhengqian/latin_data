Isis and Serapis and the Ape with the great tail and the Crocodile are the same thing as Juno, Laverna,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_77_a" id="target_note_LCL398_77_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Priapus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_77_b" id="target_note_LCL398_77_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Those thou dost worship, O Nile; these thou, O Tiber, dost venerate. It is the same superstition, though the error wears a different hue. Elsewhere there starts another path, which is hidden under bushes in the dark, and along it cattle, dumb animals, creatures that hide in the woods, make their way: it is where the mind of man is covered over, knowing nothing of heaven and living in captivity under a cruel despot. It thinks there is no God, for all things are moved by chance and the ages whirl round under no governor.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_77_c" id="target_note_LCL398_77_c"><sup>c</sup></a> This route is separated by no great distance from these ways which you tread, you who think there are many deities, a crowd of supreme gods who are mere monstrosities.

At first the path appears rude, somewhat rough, grim, and hard; but at its end it is most beautiful, furnished with plenteous riches, abounding in everlasting light, and able to make up for the toils of the past. On the manifold way the guide is the devil, who on the left hand splits it into the confusion of a hundred paths. One way he drags bearded<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_77_e" id="target_note_LCL398_77_e"><sup>e</sup></a> philosophers, another way men who are mighty in riches or honour. He tempts them on with the voices of birds, too, and cheats them with soothsaying, incites them with the obscurities of a raving old Sibyl, entangles them in astrology, drives them on to practise magic arts,
