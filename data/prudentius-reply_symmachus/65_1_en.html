the life that warms all its being: why does it not also take thought about the practice of religion? Why does it not look up in freedom to the heavens? Why, like a prisoner, does it suppose that an unchangeable destiny has been laid down for it and imagine itself in bondage to its horoscope? For now it is free to refuse what formerly it was free to will, and to wipe out its errors and change its sentiments. So for some seven hundred years<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_39_a" id="target_note_LCL398_39_a"><sup>a</sup></a> it drifted unsteadily, never knowing what form of rule it wanted or what was the just authority to govern. At the time when the city took its rise it was under a monarchic constitution, though the elders too were partners in administration; then we see that nobles of the senatorial stock handled the helm of policy; next the multitudes of the commons, joined in company with the Fathers, ruled long with equal authority in the direction both of war and peace, the strength of the nobles lying in the consul, while the commons placed their trust in the tribune.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_39_b" id="target_note_LCL398_39_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Suddenly this constitution lost favour and ten chief dignitaries<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_39_ca" id="target_note_LCL398_39_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> were appointed from the greatest nobles, with twelve fasces about them, and for each one his axe. Once more the commonwealth as a whole put itself again into the hands of a pair of leaders and allowed consuls to make up the register<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_39_d" id="target_note_LCL398_39_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; and the final period was troubled by a bloodstained trium­virate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_41_a" id="target_note_LCL398_41_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
