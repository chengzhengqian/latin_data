straying, the way where there is no turning aside into a by-road nor hesitation at a number of forks.
Yet I do not deny that a double path always confronts us and that mortality goes two ways, in uncertainty as to where its ignorance is carrying its step. The one splits into many branches, but the other is one and single. One follows after God, the other worships a number of deities and has as many offshoots as there are statues in the temples or phantoms flitting about in unsubstantial monstrous shapes. Some it carries to the Dionysiac rites of Bacchus with his thyrsus;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_75_a" id="target_note_LCL398_75_a"><sup>a</sup></a> others it tempts to the festival of Saturn,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_75_b" id="target_note_LCL398_75_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or teaches the rites of which the infant Jupiter in hiding demands payment amid the ringing of brass.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_75_c" id="target_note_LCL398_75_c"><sup>c</sup></a> And then they seek after the whips and the running about naked of young men at the Lupercalia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_75_d" id="target_note_LCL398_75_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and the Megalesian eunuch, fired with fearful frenzy, is called to utter oracles that are dark.

The source of these lines is probably Juvenal, 15, 1–11, where it is said that Egyptians think it sacrilege to eat leek or onion. This may have been true of some Egyptians in Roman times; or it may only be that some abstained from eating them; the Israelites in Egypt could eat leeks, onions and garlic freely (Numbers, xi, 5). Animals were venerated in various ways; in some cases gods were conceived of as animals or part-animal, and certain animals were sacred to certain gods.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL398_75_e').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
