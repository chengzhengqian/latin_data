Sardinian barns no longer spreading its canvas on the sea and filling the store-houses of Rome to bursting. Is the farmer of Carthage, then, filling his table with wild pears, he of Sicily feeding on herbage he has plucked from the ground? Is Sardinia now supplying the people of Remus with acorns from her oak trees? Are stony cornels now the food of the Romans? Who comes hungry to the shows in the great circus? What district<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_83_a" id="target_note_LCL398_83_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of Rome is enduring the horrors of want because the Steps<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_83_b" id="target_note_LCL398_83_b"><sup>b</sup></a> are empty? What mill on Janiculum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_83_c" id="target_note_LCL398_83_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is silent and at rest? How great is the produce every province brings, with what rich and generous fertility the fruitful world abounds, is shown by the food which the state gives to thy people, O Rome, and which feeds the long idleness of that great multitude. Granted that one year is perchance a little less fertile than another, that is nothing strange nor a new thing in the world. Former generations have learned it by suffering hunger often, if a blighting atmosphere dried up the thin clouds under a burning sun and there was no frequent rain to shed its showers in spring, when the crop was young and green; if the corn grew up before it could firm with its tender milk the grains it had conceived, and its sap was checked by the breath of a hot east wind, so that it produced unfertile stalks and a barren forest of straws cheated the farmer’s hopes and brought them to nothing. To such failings, I feel sure, the land was subject and was spoiled by them, even before the Palladium or Vesta with her fire hid from view kept safe the spirits of the house<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_83_d" id="target_note_LCL398_83_d"><sup>d</sup></a>
