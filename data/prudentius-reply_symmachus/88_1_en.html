under a Trojan roof; before Priam’s father<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_85_a" id="target_note_LCL398_85_a"><sup>a</sup></a> hired workmen to build his walls, before the maiden Pallas founded her own dear Athens—for it was in these cities, as they tell, that the Vestal fire was first caught from the primal touchwood, and Phrygian or Greek fed the hearths and held them sacred.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_85_b" id="target_note_LCL398_85_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The deviations and unsteadiness of the elements are ancient; they are often shaken out of their proper limits and rush into happenings which do not belong to their law or the course of the year. Sometimes wasting rust consumes the crop, arising from a taint and malignity in the air; sometimes in a warm spring after the west winds have blown, an icy blast from the cold north burns a fault into the corn, staining the blighted head of the stalk soot-black; or while the blade is sprouting and swelling from the tender seed it is shrivelled and killed by uninterrupted hard frosts; it cannot fix its slender tissue in the earth, and then as the frost goes deeper it is forced out of the ground and lies above it, the bare root torn away with no soil to cover it. Twin-spiked caltrops and the prickly thistle come up, those produced by parching drought, this by soaking moisture. The weather by defect or excess brings on these plagues of the earth and sickens and hurts the world. In the same way the functioning of our body often goes wrong and lapses into some imperfection; it does not continue in the right system, and by getting out of control brings disease on our organs. For the constitution of the world and of this body which we wear is one; it is the same nature that upholds both. Produced from nothing they grow up, and because they are destined to return to nothingness they either become infirm through disease or they are overcome by time </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL398_85_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL398_85_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>Laomedon, who employed the gods Poseidon and Apollo to build the walls of Troy but afterwards refused them the payment he had promised.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL398_85_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL398_85_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL398_85_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>Vesta is identical with the Greek Hestia.
