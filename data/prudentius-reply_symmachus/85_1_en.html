Away, ye pagans! You have no fellowship in the way with the people of God. Depart ye afar, and enter into your own darkness, whither that guide calls you, who goes before you over tangled ways far from the road, in the night of hell! But for us as we seek the Lord of life the one way is light and clear day and grace unmixed; we follow hope, walking by faith and enjoying things to come, to which the joys of this present life do not attain, for the pleasure that is gained already and that is to be gained hereafter do not run side by side.</p>

Symmachus (11 ff.) protests most particularly against the loss of support and privileges by the Vestal Virgins. These were six in number and their chief duty was to tend the sacred fire on the “hearth” of the state in the temple of Vesta. This goes back to very ancient times. The rites of Vesta were the most central and vital feature of the old state religion, and the Virgins were always held in great reverence and honour. To this stoppage of support Symmachus attributes a subsequent failure of the harvest and other calamities.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL398_79_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
