At one time names of girls who had certain necessary qualifications were drawn by lot, but later it became customary for fathers to offer their daughters; in either case the Pontifex Maximus laid his hand on the girl and repeated a formula which ended with the words “I take you, Amata.” She was then conducted to the Atrium Vestae (the house of the Vestals) and passed out of her father’s legal control (A.
