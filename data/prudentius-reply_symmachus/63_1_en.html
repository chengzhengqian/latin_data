to their own shrines, since they were uprooted along with their native cities. Do you not see how the steps of ancient custom turn out always to have wavered this way and that with unsteady gait, adopting gods unknown to former generations, how it is shown to have devoted itself to some foreign religion instead of keeping up its own observances? Every form of worship there is has left its home and come as an alien into an enemy’s city. It is vain therefore, O perverse reverence, to cling to wonted rites; the custom thou lovest, reprobate, is not inherited from our forefathers. No, it is not.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_35_aa" id="target_note_LCL398_35_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

Different causes led to the introduction of external cults into Rome.

The Magna Mater was brought to Rome from Phrygia at a time of national difficulty, because on consultation of the Sibylline Books the senate was advised that her presence would drive Hannibal out of Italy (Livy, XXIX, 10). Other worships came in as a result of wider and wider contacts with foreign peoples. The Egyptian and other oriental cults were long purely private and not recognised by the state, and some of them at least were at first forbidden to Roman citizens. There is nothing to suggest that Symmachus himself was a follower of any of these. It was for the old formal rites of the state religion that he stood (<span class="italic">cf</span>. Dill, p. 16).
