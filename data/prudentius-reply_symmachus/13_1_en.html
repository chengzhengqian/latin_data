There stands Alcides,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_368_a" id="target_note_LCL387_368_a"><sup>a</sup></a> all stiff in tawny bronze, he who was Arcadia’s guest after spoiling Gades; the twin brethren too, bastard sons of a seduced mother, Leda’s progeny, those night-riders, the two protecting deities of lofty Rome,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_368_b" id="target_note_LCL387_368_b"><sup>b</sup></a> bend forward, held up by a spit, and fix in a sea of lead the feet that brought the news of great victory. By these stand also figures of old-time kings, Tros, Italus, Janus Facing-Both-Ways, father Sabinus, old Saturn, and Picus of the dappled body, his frame spotted from drinking his spouse’s potion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_368_ca" id="target_note_LCL387_368_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> Each of them has his own little old altar set before his feet; and to Janus offering is made in a month when crowds assemble and auspices are taken and there is a sacred feast, which, alas, men still keep in its long-established honour, carrying on the festal rejoicing of the Kalends.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_369_d" id="target_note_LCL387_369_d"><sup>d</sup></a> In such wise has the observance grown; starting in an evil hour long ago from our forefathers it was then handed on to the generations that followed and carried further by their remote descendants. Their unthinking hearts dragged a lengthening chain, and the blind custom spread down to depraved ages.</p>
<p>Following this custom of olden days, posterity in an age when it had become easy to learn the lesson did reverence to Augustus with a month named in his honour, and with shrine and priest and altar, and propitiated him with calf and lamb; it prostrated itself before his sacred couch and asked for oracles.
