<p>See there, standing amid the gods, a man of Greece, shaped in bronze too, and gleaming on Numa’s majestic Capitol. There was an active owner of well-tilled land, a man who was notable for the wealth of his gardens; but he was an arrant whoremonger too, and with exceeding lust used to plague the poor country drabs and couch obscenely amid the willow-groves and thick-set bushes, inciting a passion untamed and ever ready for misdeeds, and giving his hot blood no rest. This man came as a famous god from his native Hellespont to the gardens of Italy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_358_a" id="target_note_LCL387_358_a"><sup>a</sup></a> with his base rites, receiving “year by year a bowl of milk and these votive cakes,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_358_b" id="target_note_LCL387_358_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and guarding the vineyards of the Sabine countryside, a shameful sight with the branch fastened to him.</p>
<p>The passion of Hercules, who was notorious for his love of a girlish boy, raged even on the thwarts while Argo tossed on the waters, and he blushed not to cover his wickedness under the wild beast’s skin of Nemea and to search for Hylas, when he disappeared, as if he had lost a wife. And now the Pinarian house fills his temple with dancing, chanting priests, where it stands on the slope of the Aventine hill.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_358_cb" id="target_note_LCL387_358_cb"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
