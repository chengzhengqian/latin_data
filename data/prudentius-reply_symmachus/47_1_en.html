The boatmen’s cries of woe and lamentation struck the skies amid the whistling in the ropes, and they had no hope left of escaping speedy wreck and drowning, when suddenly at some distance the company, whose perils had blanched their cheeks, saw Christ treading on the sea just as if He were walking over a dry shore on a firm path.
