Such were the waves on which long ago the fate or genius or spirit of the nation drifted to and fro. At last it learned to discern the right way and encircled an august head with a diadem, calling its wearer Father of his Country, director of people and senate, one who was to be leader in war, and dictator also and good censor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_41_b" id="target_note_LCL398_41_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and master of morals, to guard the nation’s wealth, to punish crimes and dispense offices of honour.
