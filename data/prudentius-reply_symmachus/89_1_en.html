and grow old and feeble; a nature which is doomed to have an end is not free from imperfection. At all times, be assured, the sky has woven the fabric of the years with varying increase. Some it has enriched with great abundance of produce, some it has doomed to be ill-starred and barren, disappointing the countryman’s labour with hopes that turned out to be empty and unfruitful. But if this cruel curse, which arises from a world we cannot trust, is avenging the Vestal maids, why does it not waste only the Christians’ fields, since it is through them that the established gifts are refused to your Virgins? We have the benefit of the return from our land and our method of tillage, and have no cause to regret the labour of our hands: and if a stone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL398_87_aa" id="target_note_LCL398_87_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> has stood there which ancient superstition used to gird with bands and petition with a hen’s lights, it is broken now and Terminus is profaned by having no offering of entrails, and the tree that was decked with ribbons and used to hold smoking lanterns is felled by the stroke of the avenging axe.

Yet men who live soberly have no need of much, and when crops are very plentiful we do not let ourselves go in pleasures by reason of our abundant riches, nor do we spring to seize the profit with greedy desire. For to those whose hope is shaped for eternity every good thing which this present life brings is slight. Thrice happy
