Does not this constitute an invitation to our young men to become turbulent agitators and harmful citizens? To what ruinous act will the subversive tendencies of tribunes not be able to be incited, once these two courts, of violence and of treason, have been abolished? Again, is not this to alter the laws of Caesar, which <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>declare that any man found guilty of violence, and likewise any man found guilty of treason, is to be outlawed? When the right of appeal is granted to such, are not Caesar’s acts rescinded? I, who never approved those acts, Members of the Senate, nevertheless judged that they should be retained for concord’s sake, and consequently I arrived at the opinion that we should not abolish at this time not only the laws passed by Caesar while yet alive but even those that you see produced and posted after Caesar’s death.</p>

<p>[10] Exiles have been restored by a dead man; citizenship <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span>has been conferred by a dead man, not only upon individuals but on peoples and whole provinces;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_31_43" id="target_note_LCL189_31_43"><sup>43</sup></a> through the granting of countless exemptions, revenues have been abolished by a dead man. Well, we defend these ordinances, produced from a private house on the authority (admittedly excellent) of one individual. What of the laws that Caesar in person read out and published and carried before our eyes, the laws in which he gloried as their sponsor, on which he believed the existence of the Republic to depend, the laws on the provinces and the courts? Yes, those laws of Caesar: do we, who defend Caesar’s acts, think they ought to be overturned? And these laws,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_31_44" id="target_note_LCL189_31_44"><sup>44</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>which have been promulgated, are at least open to protest on our part; but not even that was permitted in the case of laws alleged to have been already passed. They were passed without any promulgation before they were committed to writing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_31_45" id="target_note_LCL189_31_45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
