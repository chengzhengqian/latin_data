However, if these demonstrations, which are highly impressive, seem rather trivial in your eyes, surely you cannot dismiss, can you, your perception of the deep concern felt by the Roman people for Aulus Hirtius’ life?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_45_60" id="target_note_LCL189_45_60"><sup>60</sup></a> It was enough to be well thought of by the Roman people, as he is, a delight to his friends—no man is more so—loved by his family, who love him very dearly, but the anxiety expressed by decent folk, the alarm—do we remember the like of it in any other such case?

<p>Members of the Senate, I am well rewarded for my return inasmuch as whatever chance may now befall, my words will stand as a witness to my steadfast purpose; and you have given me a courteous and attentive hearing. If I have the opportunity to address you more frequently without danger to you and myself, I shall take advantage of it. If not, I shall, to the best of my ability, preserve my life, not so much for myself as for the Republic. For myself, I have lived pretty well long enough, whether in years or in glory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_45_62" id="target_note_LCL189_45_62"><sup>62</sup></a> If more is to come, it will come not so much for me as for you and for the Republic.</p>
