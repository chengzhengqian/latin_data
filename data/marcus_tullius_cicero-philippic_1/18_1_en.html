<p>[14] What I am more afraid of is that in ignorance of the true path of glory, you think it glorious to have more power than the rest of us put together and prefer the fear of your countrymen to their esteem. If you think along those lines, you are utterly ignorant of the road to glory. It is glorious to be a citizen dear to the community, to deserve well of the Republic, to be praised and courted and esteemed. But to be feared and hated carries ill-will, execration, weakness, insecurity. Even in the play we see <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span>that it was ruinous to the very character<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_41_54" id="target_note_LCL189_41_54"><sup>54</sup></a> who said “Let them hate me, so long as they fear me.” Ah, Marcus Antonius, would that you remembered your grandfather!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_41_55" id="target_note_LCL189_41_55"><sup>55</sup></a> But you have heard me talk of him much and very often! Do you think <span class="italic">he</span> would have wished to earn immortality, if that involved being feared on account of a license to keep an armed following? No, the life and success he wanted meant parity in freedom, primacy in prestige. And so, to say nothing of your grandfather’s time of prosperity, I would prefer that bitterest last day of his life to the autocracy of Lucius Cinna, who cruelly murdered him. But why <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span>do I try to turn you from your course with words? If Gaius Caesar’s end cannot cause you to prefer to be loved than to be feared, nobody’s words will do any good or make any impression. Those who think Caesar was happy are themselves miserable. No man is happy who lives on such terms that he can be killed not only with impunity but even to the supreme glory of his killer. Therefore, alter your course, I beg you, and look back</p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_41_54"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_41_54" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">54</sup>Atreus, Greek king of Mycene and father of Agamemnon and Menelaus.
