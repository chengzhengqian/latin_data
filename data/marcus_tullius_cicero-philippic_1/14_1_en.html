<p>And now I put a question: why should I or any of you, Members of the Senate, fear bad laws when we have good tribunes of the plebs? There they are, ready to use their veto, ready to defend the Republic by the sanctity of their office. Our minds should be at ease. “Vetoes?” says he. “Religious sanctions? What are you talking about?” Why, naturally, those which are bound up with the welfare of the Republic. “Oh, we take no notice of that sort of thing. Antiquated nonsense, that’s what we think of it. The Forum will be fenced off, all entries barred. Armed men will be posted on guard at many points.” And then what? Will something <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span>transacted in this fashion be a law? I suppose you will have the stock formula in legislation engraved on bronze: “The Consuls lawfully proposed to the people”—is <span class="italic">this</span> the traditional right of proposal?—“and the people lawfully enacted.” What people? The people who were shut out? Lawfully? Are you referring to a legality that has been entirely abolished by armed violence? Now understand, I am speaking of the future—it is the part of friends to speak beforehand of such things as can be avoided. If they do not come to pass, my words will be refuted. I am talking about promulgated laws, as to which your hands are still free, and I am pointing out flaws. Remove them! I warn of violence, of armed force. Take it away!</p>
