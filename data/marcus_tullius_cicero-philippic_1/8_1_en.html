Some of these disasters are already upon us; others, I fear, hang over our heads. But I could wish that the immortal gods may pardon the Roman people, who do not approve of what was done, and pardon this body, which passed the decree against its will.</p>
<p>What of other public ills? Is it permitted to speak of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>them? Permitted it is to me, and ever shall be, to maintain honor and despise death. Just let me have the power to enter this place, and I do not decline the risk of speaking. And I only wish, Members of the Senate, that I could have been present on the first of August; not because anything could have been accomplished, but to prevent what actually occurred, namely that only one consular was found worthy of that rank, worthy of the Republic. Indeed, it grieves me to the heart that persons who have enjoyed the highest gifts the Roman people can bestow did not follow the lead given by Lucius Piso in his most admirable motion. Was it for this reason that the Roman people made us consuls, in order that we in so exalted a station, the highest in the land, might set the Republic at naught? Not only did no consular support Lucius Piso by word but not even by look. For <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>pity’s sake, what is this voluntary slavery? Granted that slavery of a sort was unavoidable in time past:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_21_29" id="target_note_LCL189_21_29"><sup>29</sup></a> it is not so now. At the same time, I do not expect this from all senators who express their views with the status of an ex-consul.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_21_30" id="target_note_LCL189_21_30"><sup>30</sup></a> It is not the same with those whose silence I pardon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_21_31" id="target_note_LCL189_21_31"><sup>31</sup></a> as with those whose voice I demand.
