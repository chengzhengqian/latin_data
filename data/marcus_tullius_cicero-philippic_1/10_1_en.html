However, I am not tampering with them, not at all; I am a most enthusiastic defender of Caesar’s splendid acts. One <span class="italic">could</span> wish the money in the Temple of Ops were still there. To be sure, it is stained with blood,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_25_34" id="target_note_LCL189_25_34"><sup>34</sup></a> but it is really needed in these circumstances, since it is not being returned to its rightful owners. And yet, let it also be dissipated, if it was so ordered in Caesar’s acts. Is there anything <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>at all so much as a law that can properly be called an act of one who in a civilian capacity has wielded power and authority in public life? Ask to be shown the acts of Gracchus: the Sempronian laws will be held up. Ask to be shown Sulla’s: voilà, the Cornelian laws. Come, what were the acts that made up Pompey’s third consulship? Why, his legislation. If you could ask Caesar himself what he had done in Rome, in a civilian capacity, he would answer that he had passed many fine laws, but as for his handwritten notes, he would either change them or not produce them or, if he did produce them, he would not consider such jottings among his acts. However, this also I concede; in certain matters I am even ready to turn a blind eye; but in the most important matters of all, that is to say laws, I do not think it tolerable that Caesar’s acts should be set aside.</p>
