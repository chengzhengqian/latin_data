<h2>Marcus Tullius Cicero’s First Philippic Oration Against Marcus Antonius</h2>
<p>[1] Before I say, Members of the Senate, what I think <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span>ought to be said at this time concerning public affairs, I shall briefly explain to you my rationale both for setting out on my journey and for turning back.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_7_1" id="target_note_LCL189_7_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Hoping, as I did, that the Republic had at last been restored to your guidance and authority, I took the view that I ought to stay on a vigil, so to speak, of the sort that befits a consular and a senator. In fact, from that day on which we were summoned to the Temple of Tellus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_7_2" id="target_note_LCL189_7_2"><sup>2</sup></a> neither did I withdraw anywhere from, nor did I take my eyes off public affairs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_7_3" id="target_note_LCL189_7_3"><sup>3</sup></a> In that temple, so far as was in my power, I laid the foundations of peace and revived the ancient Athenian precedent, even adopting the Greek term<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_7_4" id="target_note_LCL189_7_4"><sup>4</sup></a> that was used by that community in laying their quarrels to rest at that time; that is, I proposed that all recollection of disputes should be obliterated and forgotten for all time.</p>
<p>Marcus Antonius made a fine speech on that occasion <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>and also showed outstanding goodwill. Finally, through him and his son,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_7_5" id="target_note_LCL189_7_5"><sup>5</sup></a> peace with our most distinguished fellow countrymen was established. And the sequel was in harmony
