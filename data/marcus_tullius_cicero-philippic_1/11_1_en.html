And do you defend Caesar’s acts while you subvert his laws? Or perhaps we should say that if Caesar jotted something in a notebook as an aid to memory, we must count that among his acts and defend it, no matter how unjust and inadvisable it may be, whereas a law that he submitted to the people at the centuriate assembly is not to be regarded as an act of Caesar’s?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_27_37" id="target_note_LCL189_27_37"><sup>37</sup></a> However, what is this <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span>third jury panel? “It is composed of centurions,” he says. Indeed? Service as a juror was not open to that class under the Julian law, and even earlier under the Pompeian and Aurelian?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_27_38" id="target_note_LCL189_27_38"><sup>38</sup></a> “That was with a property qualification,” he says. Well, but this applied not merely to a centurion but to a Roman knight as well. And so, brave and respectable persons who have served as centurions are sitting on juries and have done so in the past. “I am not interested in those individuals,” he says. “Let every man who has served as centurion sit on juries.” But if you and your colleague were making the same proposal with respect to every man who has served in the army on horseback,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_27_39" id="target_note_LCL189_27_39"><sup>39</sup></a> which carries more distinction, you would win support from no one. In a juror both financial means and status ought to be considered. “I am not interested in all that,” he says. “In addition, I am giving the right to private soldiers of the Larks Legion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_27_40" id="target_note_LCL189_27_40"><sup>40</sup></a> Our people<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_27_41" id="target_note_LCL189_27_41"><sup>41</sup></a> say that otherwise they cannot be safe from prosecution.” Oh what an insulting honor for those whom you and your colleague are summoning out of the blue to sit as jurors.
