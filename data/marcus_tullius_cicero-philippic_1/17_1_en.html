<p>The next day and the next and the next and onwards, one day after another, you did not cease to bring the Republic a daily gift, so to speak; the greatest of all was your act of abolishing the title dictator. Thereby you—yes, <span class="italic">you</span>, I say—branded Caesar in his grave with everlasting infamy.

After these magnificent contributions to the welfare of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span>the Republic, surely you felt no regret for your success, did you, no regret for your greatness, none for your fame, none for your glory? What, then, is the cause of this sudden and significant change in your course? I cannot bring myself to suspect that you yielded to a pecuniary temptation. People may say what they please; one does not have to believe them. I have never known anything mean, anything sordid in your character. True, men are sometimes corrupted by those close to them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_39_53" id="target_note_LCL189_39_53"><sup>53</sup></a> But I know what stout stuff you are </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_39_49"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_39_49" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">49</sup>Cf. 2.79–84.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_39_49').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL189_39_50"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_39_50" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">50</sup>Cf. §2.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_39_50').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL189_39_51"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_39_51" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">51</sup>Caesar’s assassins.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_39_51').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_39_52"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_39_52" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">52</sup>Suspected of aiming at despotic power, he was killed in 384.
