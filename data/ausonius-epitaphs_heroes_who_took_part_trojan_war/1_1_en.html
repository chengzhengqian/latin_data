<p>I have thought it to the purpose to finish off this little work and to append it—for however trifling it may be, it is kindred in substance—to my little book commemorating the Professors of Bordeaux, whether they were strangers teaching at Bordeaux or fellowcountrymen teaching abroad. It is the <span class="italic">Epitaphs</span> [that is to say, funerary inscriptions] <span class="italic">on the Heroes who took part in the Trojan War.</span> It consists, indeed, of ancient poems which I found in the possession of some scholar and turned into Latin, on such terms as not to follow the strict letter of the original slavishly, but to paraphrase it freely, though without missing the point.</p>

Nos. xxvii.–xxxv. have no connection with the Trojan War, and were probably thrust into their present place by an editor who, after the death of Ausonius, introduced his unpublished work into the published collection wherever it seemed to fit in more or less appropriately.
