Take, then, this epitaph—poor consolation!—for your tomb, and gallop nimblehoofed to join the wing hoofed steeds of Elysium. Hereafter let Pegasus run on your right and Arion be your left-wheeler; and let Castor find you the fourth horse!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Carus</span> has built me as one sepulchre for himself, his wife, and children, when at length they die. Long now their resting-places have lain empty, and may that complaint grow yet older: let each come in the order fixed by the law of birth, and through peaceful years let him who is the earlier born be laid to rest the earlier.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Anicia</span> has spent all those treasures which are the hope of a long life before her second decade reached its full. While a mere baby she gave suck; while yet a girl she was mature; she married, she conceived, she bare her child, and now has died a matron. Who can blame death? And yet who can not blame him in this case? In age’s gains she is a crone; in age itself, a girl.</p>
