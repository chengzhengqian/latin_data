<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">XIX.—For Polydorus</span></span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">Begone</span> far hence, unconscious stranger, and avoid that myrtle-tree: ’tis grown from darts and nourished with my blood. Pierced through with spears and almost buried in my very slaying, I, Polydorus, lie twice interred beneath this mound. Pious Aeneas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_151_3" id="target_note_LCL096_151_3"><sup>3</sup></a> knows my story, and you also, impious king; for as it was Thracian cruelty that crushed me, so it was Trojan piety that buried me.</p>

<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">XX.—For Euphemus</span></span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">Euphemus</span>, leader of the Cicones, was laid in Trojan soil hard by the statue of spear-bearing Mars. No epitaph graven on his tombstone suffices, but statues also pile their weight upon him. Those monuments fall the sooner which are heaped up so high, and where magnificence is too great, great ruin lurks beneath.</p>
