<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">XXV.—For Hecuba</span></span></h2>
<p>I <span class="sc">Who</span> was a queen, I, famous Dymas’ child, I, Priam’s wife, I who bare Hector, I, Hecuba, perished here, o’erwhelmed with showers of stones, though not before the fury of my tongue had avenged me. Put not your trust in royal state, nor motherhood, nor lofty birth, ye who read this my Cynosema.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_155_1" id="target_note_LCL096_155_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">XXVI.—For Polyxena</span></span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">I am</span> Polyxena of Troy, mated with Achilles in the tomb: would rather I had died without a sod to cover me. You do not well, Achaeans, to unite enemies in the grave: this was to violate, rather than to bury me.</p>

<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">XXVII.—On Niobe Buried on Mount Sipylus near a Fountain</span></span></h2>
<p>A <span class="sc">queen</span> of Thebes was I, who am now a crag of Sipylus for my offence against the godhead of Leto’s offspring. Happy and proud to have borne twice seven children, I buried as many as I bare. Yet even this did not content the gods: hard stone encased me round until I lost all shape of human form. But though my vital parts are crusted o’er, grief clings to them and pours forth a perpetual stream of pitying tears. Ah, cruel deed! Do heavenly spirits hate so bitterly? A mother’s grief lasts on, her shape passes away.</p>
