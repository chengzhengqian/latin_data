any decree of the senate, because the senators were <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 212</span>unwilling to offend the tax-farmers as a class at such a crisis. The people proved a more unsparing avenger of dishonesty; namely, two tribunes of the plebs, Spurius and Lucius Carvilius, were at length aroused, and seeing that the affair was unpopular and notorious, imposed a fine of two hundred thousand asses upon Marcus Postumius. When the day for his protest against this fine arrived, the assembly of the commons<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_351_1" id="target_note_LCL355_351_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was so large that the open space on the Capitol could scarcely contain the crowd.

Finding in him no sufficient protection, the publicans, in order to prevent action, rushed in a wedge through the space cleared by removal of the crowd, while at the same time they reviled the people and the tribunes. And it had almost come to a battle when Fulvius, the consul, said to the tribunes, “Do you not see that you are reduced to the ranks,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_351_4" id="target_note_LCL355_351_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and that this means an insurrection if you do not promptly dismiss the popular assembly?”</p>
