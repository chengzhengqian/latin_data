<p>XI. For previously, to avoid leaving the capital without a competent authority, when the kings—or, later, the magistrates—had to absent themselves from home, it was usual to choose a temporary official to preside in the courts and deal with emergencies; and the tradition runs that Denter Romulius was appointed by Romulus, and, subsequently, Numa Marcius by Tullus Hostilius, and Spurius Lucretius by Tarquinius Superbus. Then the right of delegation passed to the consuls; and a shade of the old order lingers whenever, on account of the Latin Festival, a Prefect is commissioned to discharge the consular functions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_173_2" id="target_note_LCL312_173_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Again, in the civil wars, Augustus placed Cilnius Maecenas of the equestrian order at the head of all affairs in Rome and Italy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_173_3" id="target_note_LCL312_173_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Then, upon his advent to power, as the population was large and legal remedies dilatory, he took from the body of ex-consuls an official to coerce the slaves as well as that class of the free-born community whose boldness renders it turbulent, unless it is overawed by force.
