Suddenly the signal was given: the canopy above them, which had been heavily weighted with lead, dropped, and Crepercius was crushed and killed on the spot. Agrippina and Acerronia were saved by the height of the couch-sides, which, as it happened, were too solid to give way under the impact. Nor did the break-up of the vessel follow: for confusion was universal, and even the men accessory to the plot were impeded by the large numbers of the ignorant. The crew then decided to throw their weight on one side and so capsize the ship; but, even on their own part, agreement came too slowly for a sudden emergency, and a counter-effort by others allowed the victims a gentler fall into the waves. Acerronia, however, incautious enough to raise the cry that she was Agrippina, and to demand aid for the emperor’s mother, was despatched with poles, oars, and every nautical weapon that came to hand. Agrippina, silent and so not generally recognised, though she received one wound in the shoulder, swam until she was met by a few fishing-smacks, and so reached the Lucrine lake,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_115_1" id="target_note_LCL322_115_1"><sup>1</sup></a> whence she was carried into her own villa.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_115_2a" id="target_note_LCL322_115_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

Lake Avernus and to pierce and reinforce the sand dune separating it from the Gulf of Baiae.

If it was Bauli—the supposition which squares most easily with the account of her cremation and the subsequent
burial in chap. 9,—then the reader is left to infer that, after landing, she procured a litter to carry her there. On the other hand, the presence of <span class="italic">suae,</span> the prelix in <span class="italic">infertur,</span> the unlikelihood that a half-drowned woman would be able—or, if able, inclined—to make a fairly considerable journey, long after midnight (D.
