now, Nero, it prates of yourself and Thrasea. And he has his followers—his satellites, rather—who affect, not as yet the contumacity of his opinions, but his bearing and his looks, and whose stiffness and austerity are designed for an impeachment of your wantonness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_371_1" id="target_note_LCL322_371_1"><sup>1</sup></a> To him alone your safety is a thing uncared for, your talents a thing unhonoured. The imperial happiness he cannot brook: can he not even be satisfied with the imperial bereavements and sorrows? Not to believe Poppaea deity bespeaks the same temper that will not swear to the acts of the deified Augustus and the deified Julius. He contemns religion, he abrogates law. The journal of the Roman people,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_371_2" id="target_note_LCL322_371_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is scanned throughout the provinces and armies with double care for news of what Thrasea has not done! Either let us pass over to his creed, if it is the better, or let these seekers after a new world lose their chief and their instigator. It is the sect that produced the Tuberones and the Favonii<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_371_3" id="target_note_LCL322_371_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—names unloved even in the old republic. In order to subvert the empire, they make a parade of liberty: the empire overthrown, they will lay hands on liberty itself. You have removed Cassius to little purpose, if you intend to allow these rivals of the Bruti to multiply and flourish! A word in conclusion: write nothing yourself about Thrasea—leave
the senate to decide between us!’” Nero
