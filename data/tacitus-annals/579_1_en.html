Pompeius,
Cornelius Martialis, Flavius Nepos, and Statius Domitius, were deprived of their rank, on the ground that, without hating the Caesar, they had yet the reputation of doing so. Novius Priscus, as a friend of Seneca, Glitius Gallus and Annius Pollio as discredited if hardly convicted, were favoured with sentences of exile. Priscus was accompanied by his wife Artoria Flaccilla, Gallus by Egnatia Maximilla,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_329_3" id="target_note_LCL322_329_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the mistress of a great fortune, at first left intact but afterwards confiscated—two circumstances which redounded equally to her fame. Rufrius Crispinus was also banished: the conspiracy supplied the occasion, but he was detested by Nero as a former husband of Poppaea. To Verginius Flavus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_329_4" id="target_note_LCL322_329_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and Musonius Rufus expulsion was brought by the lustre of their names; for Verginius fostered the studies of youth by his eloquence, Musonius by the precepts of philosophy. As though to complete the troop and a round number, Cluvidienus Quietus, Julius Agrippa, Blitius Catulinus, Petronius Priscus, and Julius Altinus were allowed the Aegean islands. But Scaevinus’ wife Caedicia and Caesennius Maximus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_329_5" id="target_note_LCL322_329_5"><sup>5</sup></a>
were debarred from Italy, and by their punishment—and that alone—discovered that they had been on trial. Lucan’s mother Acilia was ignored, without acquittal and without penalty.</p>
