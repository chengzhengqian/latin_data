historians or in the government journals,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_527_1" id="target_note_LCL249_527_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that the prince’s mother, Antonia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_527_2" id="target_note_LCL249_527_2"><sup>2</sup></a> bore any striking part in the ceremonies, although, in addition to Agrippina and Drusus and Claudius, his other blood-relations are recorded by name. Ill-health may have been the obstacle; or a spirit broken with grief may have shrunk from facing the visible evidence of its great affliction; but I find it more credible that Tiberius and Augusta, who did not quit the palace, kept her there, in order to give the impression of a parity of sorrow—of a grandmother and uncle detained at home in loyalty to the example of a mother.</p>
<p>IV. The day on which the remains were consigned to the mausoleum of Augustus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_527_3" id="target_note_LCL249_527_3"><sup>3</sup></a> was alternately a desolation of silence and a turmoil of laments. The city-streets were full, the Campus Martius alight with torches. There the soldier in harness,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_527_4" id="target_note_LCL249_527_4"><sup>4</sup></a> the magistrate lacking his insignia, the burgher in his tribe, iterated the cry that “the commonwealth had fallen and hope was dead” too freely and too openly for it to be credible that they remembered their governors. Nothing, however, sank deeper into Tiberius’ breast than the kindling of men’s enthusiasm for Agrippina—“the glory of her country, the last scion of Augustus, the peerless pattern of ancient virtue.” So they styled her; and, turning to heaven and the gods, prayed for the continuance of her issue—“and might they survive their persecutors!”</p>
<p>V. There were those who missed the pageantry
