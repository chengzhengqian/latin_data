that she had heard nothing. However, the witnesses who supported the fatal charge were considered the more credible; and, on the motion of the consul designate, Haterius Agrippa, the last penalty was invoked against the culprit.</p>
<p>L. Opposition came from Manius Lepidus, whose speech ran thus:—“If, Conscript Fathers, we regard one point only,—the enormity of the utterance by which Clutorius Priscus has defiled his own soul and the ears of men,—neither the cell, nor the noose,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_601_1" id="target_note_LCL249_601_1"><sup>1</sup></a> nor even the torments reserved for slaves<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_601_2" id="target_note_LCL249_601_2"><sup>2</sup></a> are adequate to his punishment. But if, while vice and crime are limitless, the penalties and remedies of both are tempered by the sovereign’s moderation and by the example of your ancestors and yourselves; if there is a difference between fatuity and villainy, between evil-speaking and evil-doing; then there is room for a proposal which neither leaves the defendant’s guilt unpunished nor gives us cause to rue either our softness or our hardness of heart. Time and again I have heard our prince express his regret when anyone by taking his own life had forestalled his clemency. Clutorius’ life is still intact: he is a man whom to spare can involve no public menace; whom to slay can create no public deterrent. His occupations are as futile and erratic as they are charged with folly; nor can any grave and considerable danger be expected from a person who by betraying his own infamy insinuates himself into the favour not of men but of silly women. Expel him, however, from Rome, confiscate his property, ban him from fire and water: this is my proposal, and I make it precisely as though he were guilty under the law of treason.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_601_3" id="target_note_LCL249_601_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
