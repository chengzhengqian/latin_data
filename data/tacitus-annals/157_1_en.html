front of the encampment so as to offer battle in the open. As the cohort broke at the first onset, he darted eagerly among the missiles, to intercept the fugitives, cursing the standard-bearers who could see Roman soldiers turn their backs to a horde of undrilled men or deserters. At the same time, he turned his wounded breast and his face—with one eye pierced—to confront the enemy, and continued to fight until he dropped forsaken by his troop.</p>
<p>XXI. When the news reached Lucius Apronius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_555_1" id="target_note_LCL249_555_1"><sup>1</sup></a> (the successor of Camillus), perturbed more by the disgrace of his own troops than by the success of the enemy, he resorted to a measure rare in that period and reminiscent of an older world, drawing by lot and flogging to death every tenth man in the dishonoured cohort.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_555_2" id="target_note_LCL249_555_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And so effective was the severity that, when the same forces of Tacfarinas assaulted a stronghold named Thala,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_555_3" id="target_note_LCL249_555_3"><sup>3</sup></a> they were routed by a company of veterans not more than five hundred in number. During the engagement a private soldier, Helvius Rufus, earned the distinction of saving a Roman life, and was presented by Apronius with the collar and spear: the civic crown was added by the emperor; who regretted, more in sorrow than in anger, that the proconsul had not exercised his power to award this further honour.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_555_4a" id="target_note_LCL249_555_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> As the Numidians

It was, in fact, a standing emblem of the imperial house, though declined by Tiberius (Suet. <span class="italic">Tib.</span> 26): The indispensable conditions were that the recipient should be a Roman citizen; that he should have saved the life of a Roman on the battle-field; that he should have slain an enemy in so doing; and that he should not have fallen back from the ground on which his exploit was performed (Plin. <span class="italic">H.N.</span> XVI. 4; Gell. V. 6). Since Africa was unique among senatorial provinces in that the proconsul had a legion under him, Apronius would have been within his rights in conferring the crown: otherwise, its bestowal would have rested with the emperor (see XV. 12). From a still extant inscription we gather that Helvius took the cognomen “Civica,” rose to be leading-centurion, and presented baths to his fellow-townsmen of Varia (Vicovaro, near Tivoli).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL249_555_4a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
