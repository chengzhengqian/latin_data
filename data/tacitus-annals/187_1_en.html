temples, arches, and other time-worn honours. An exception was when Marcus Silanus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_615_1" id="target_note_LCL249_615_1"><sup>1</sup></a> sought a compliment to the principate in a slight to the consulship, and proposed that on public and private monuments the inscription recording the date should bear the names, not of the consuls for the year, but of the persons exercising the tribunician power. Quintus Haterius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_615_2" id="target_note_LCL249_615_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who moved that the day’s resolutions should be set up in the senate-house in letters of gold, was derided as an old man who could reap nothing from his repulsive adulation save its infamy.</p>
<p>LVIII. Meanwhile, after the governorship of Junius Blaesus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_615_3" id="target_note_LCL249_615_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in Africa had been extended, the Flamen Dialis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_615_4" id="target_note_LCL249_615_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Servius Maluginensis, demanded the allotment of Asia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_615_5" id="target_note_LCL249_615_5"><sup>5</sup></a> to himself. “It was a common fallacy,” he insisted, “that the flamens of Jove were not allowed to leave Italy; nor was his own legal status different from that of the flamens of Mars and Quirinus. If, then, they had had provinces allotted them, why was the right withheld from the priests of Jove? There was no national decree to be found on the point—nothing in the Books of Ceremonies. The pontiffs had often performed the rites of Jove, if the flamen was prevented by sickness or public business. For seventy-five years after the self-murder of Cornelius Merula<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_615_6" id="target_note_LCL249_615_6"><sup>6</sup></a> no one had been appointed in his room, yet the rites had not been interrupted. But if so many years could elapse without a new creation, and without detriment to the cult, how much more easily could he absent himself for twelve months of proconsular authority?
