<p>XLV. The same year saw the capital visited by a serious fire, the part of the Circus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_233_1" id="target_note_LCL312_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a> adjoining the Aventine being burnt down along with the Aventine itself: a disaster which the Caesar converted to his own glory by paying the full value of the mansions and tenement-blocks destroyed. One hundred million sesterces were invested in this act of munificence, which came the more acceptably to the multitude that he was far from extravagant in building on his own behalf; whilst, even on the public account, the only two works he erected were the temple of Augustus and the stage of Pompey’s theatre,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_233_2" id="target_note_LCL312_233_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and in each case he was either too scornful of popularity or too old to dedicate them after completion. To estimate the losses of the various claimants, four husbands of the Caesar’s granddaughters<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_233_3" id="target_note_LCL312_233_3"><sup>3</sup></a> were appointed: Gnaeus Domitius, Cassius Longinus, Marcus Vinicius, and Rubellius Blandus. Publius Petronius was added by nomination of the consuls. Honours varying with the ingenuity of their authors were invented and voted to the sovereign. Which of these he rejected or accepted remained unknown, since the end of his days was at hand.</p>

Gnaeus Acerronius and Gaius Petronius, inaugurated their term of office. By this time the influence of Macro exceeded all bounds. Never careless of the good graces of Gaius Caesar, he was now courting them with daily increasing energy; and after the death of Claudia, whose espousal to the prince has been mentioned earlier,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_233_4" id="target_note_LCL312_233_4"><sup>4</sup></a> he had induced his wife Ennia to captivate the youth by a mockery of love and to bind him by a promise of marriage.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_233_5" id="target_note_LCL312_233_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Caligula
