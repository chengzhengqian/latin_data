Hence, by the divine favour, salt in that river and in these forests was not produced, as in other countries, by allowing water to evaporate in a pool left by the sea, but by pouring it on a blazing pile of trees, crystallization taking place through the union of two opposed elements, water and fire.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_101_1" id="target_note_LCL322_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The struggle, which went in favour of the Hermunduri, was the more diastrous to the Chatti in that both sides consecrated, in the event of victory, the adverse host to Mars and Mercury;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_101_2" id="target_note_LCL322_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a> a vow implying the extermination of horses, men, and all objects whatsoever.

Then, as the flames became stationary, they went close up and attempted to scare them away like wild animals by striking them with clubs and thrashing them with other implements: finally, they stripped off their clothes and piled them on the fire, which they were the more likely to smother as they had been worn and soiled by common use.</p>
