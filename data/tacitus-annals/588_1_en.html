<p>VII. To the death of Poppaea, outwardly regretted, but welcome to all who remembered her profligacy and cruelty, Nero added a fresh measure of odium by prohibiting Gaius Cassius from attendance at the funeral. It was the first hint of mischief. Nor was the mischief long delayed. Silanus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_347_1" id="target_note_LCL322_347_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was associated with him; their only crime being that Cassius was eminent for a great hereditary fortune and an austere character, Silanus for a noble lineage and a temperate youth. Accordingly, the emperor sent a speech to the senate, arguing that both should be removed from public life, and objecting to the former that, among his other ancestral effigies, he had honoured a bust of Gaius Cassius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_347_2" id="target_note_LCL322_347_2"><sup>2</sup></a> inscribed:—“<span class="italic">To the leader of the cause</span>.” The seeds of civil war, and revolt from the house of the Caesars,—such were the objects he had pursued.
