In the beginning of the year, the war between Parthia and Rome for the possession of Armenia, feebly begun, and till now carried on in dilatory fashion, was taken up with energy. For, on the one hand, Vologeses declined to allow his brother Tiridates
to be debarred from the kingdom, which he had himself presented to him, or to hold it as the gift of an alien power; and, on the other, Corbulo considered it due to the majesty of the Roman nation to recover the old conquests of Lucullus and Pompey.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_57_1" id="target_note_LCL322_57_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In addition, the Armenians—whose allegiance was a matter of doubt—were invoking the arms of both powers; though by geographical position and affinity of manners they stood closer to the Parthians, were connected with them by inter-marriage, and. in their ignorance of liberty, were more inclined to accept servitude in that quarter.</p>

For the legions transferred from Syria showed, after the enervation of a long peace, pronounced reluctance to undergo the duties of a Roman camp. It was a well-known fact that his army included veterans who had never served on a picket or a watch, who viewed the rampart

whole account should be read consecutively—the capture of Tigranocerta, with the events culminating in the induction of Tigranes into his kingdom and the withdrawal of Corbulo and the legions. The question obviously arises:—Where are the events of 59 <span class="sc">a.d.</span> related? In XIII. 36 sqq. or XIV. 23 sqq., or part in the former place, part in the latter? According to the answer, three methods of dating are possible:—Preparatory
measures of Corbulo (XIII. 35 <span class="italic">Sed Corbuloni</span> . . . <span class="italic">peditatu cohortium</span>): (<span class="italic">a</span>) (Mommsen) 55–58 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>; (<span class="italic">b</span>) (Furneaux) 55–57 <span class="sc">a.d</span>.; (<span class="italic">c</span>) (Egli, Henderson) 55–57 <span class="sc">a.d.</span> Preliminary winter in Armenia (XIII. 35 <span class="italic">retentusque . . . ignoscebatur</span>): (<span class="italic">a</span>) 58–59 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>; (<span class="italic">b</span>) 57–58 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>, (<span class="italic">c</span>) 57–58 <span class="sc">a.d</span>. Operations resulting in the fall of Artaxata: (<span class="italic">a</span>) 59 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>; (<span class="italic">b</span>) 58 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>; (<span class="italic">c</span>) 58 <span class="sc">a.d.</span> and the early summer of 59 <span class="sc">a.d.</span> March upon and fall of Tigranocerta: (<span class="italic">a</span>) 60 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>; (<span class="italic">b</span>) 59 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>; (<span class="italic">c</span>) late summer of 59 <span class="sc">a.d.</span> Other operations, arrival of Tigranes, withdrawal of Corbulo: (<span class="italic">a</span>), (<span class="italic">b</span>), (<span class="italic">c</span>) 60 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>—One of the systems must be right: all, as will be seen, are open to grave objections. In any case, the narrative of Tacitus—who had Corbulo’s own memoirs to draw upon—is singularly unsatisfactory.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL322_57_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
