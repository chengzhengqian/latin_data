Ostorius, aware that first results are those which engender fear or confidence, swept his cohorts forward at speed, cut down the resisters, chased the broken bands and—to obviate a second rally, to be followed by a sullen and disloyal peace which would allow no rest either to the general or his troops—prepared to disarm the suspect and to overawe the whole district on this side of the Trent and Severn.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_357_3a" id="target_note_LCL312_357_3a"><sup>3a</sup></a> The first to become restive were the Iceni,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_357_4" id="target_note_LCL312_357_4"><sup>4</sup></a> a powerful community not yet broken in battle, as they had voluntarily acceded to our alliance. At their suggestion, the surrounding tribes chose for their field of battle a position protected by a rustic embankment with a narrow approach, designed to be impervious to cavalry.
