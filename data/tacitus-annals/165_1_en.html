gave up the ghost, Lucius Volusius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_571_1" id="target_note_LCL249_571_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and Sallustius Crispus. Volusius belonged to an old family which, none the less, had never advanced beyond the praetorship. He himself enriched it with the consulate, and, besides discharging the duties of the censorship in the selection of the equestrian decuries,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_571_2" id="target_note_LCL249_571_2"><sup>2</sup></a> became the first accumulator of the wealth which raised the family fortunes to such unmeasured heights. Crispus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_571_3" id="target_note_LCL249_571_3"><sup>3</sup></a> a knight by extraction, was the grandson of a sister of Gaius Sallustius, the brilliant Roman historian, who adopted him into his family and name. Thus for him the avenue to the great offices lay clear; but, choosing to emulate Maecenas, without holding senatorial rank he outstripped in influence many who had won a triumph or the consulate; while by his elegancy and refinements he was sundered from the old Roman school, and in the ample and generous scale of his establishment approached extravagance. Yet under it all lay a mental energy, equal to gigantic tasks, and all the more active from the display he made of somnolence and apathy. Hence, next to Maecenas, while Maecenas lived, and later next to none, he it was who sustained the burden of the secrets of emperors.

The same lot had fallen to Maecenas also,—whether influence, rarely perpetual, dies a natural death, or there comes a satiety, sometimes to the monarch who has no more to give, sometimes to the favourite with no more to crave.</p>
