in Fabius Romanus, one of Lucan’s intimate friends. A fictitious charge, that knowledge of the plot had been shared between father and son, was backed by a forged letter from Lucan. Nero, after inspecting it, gave orders that it was to be carried to Mela. Mela took what was then the favoured way of death, and opened an artery, first penning a codicil by which he bequeathed a large sum to Tigellinus and his son-in-law Cossutianus Capito,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_363_1" id="target_note_LCL322_363_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in hopes of saving the rest of the will. A postscript to the codicil, written in appearance as a protest against the iniquity of his doom, stated that, while he himself was dying without a cause for his execution, Rufrius Crispinus and Anicius Cerialis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_363_2" id="target_note_LCL322_363_2"><sup>2</sup></a> remained in the enjoyment of life, though bitterly hostile to the emperor.

He was a man whose day was passed in sleep, his nights in the social duties and amenities of life: others industry may raise to greatness—Petronius had idled into fame.
