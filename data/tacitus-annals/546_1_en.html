<p>XXX. To his glories Corbulo added courtesy and a banquet; and upon the inquiries of the king, whenever he observed some novelty—the announcement, for instance, by a centurion of the beginning of the watches; the dismissal of the company by bugle-note; the application of a torch to fire the altar raised in front of the general’s pavilion—he so far exaggerated each point as to inspire him with admiration for our ancient customs. On the next day, Tiridates applied for a respite in which to visit his brothers and his mother before embarking upon so long a journey: in the interval, he handed over his daughter as a hostage, together with a letter of petition to Nero.</p>
<p>XXXI. On his departure, he found Pacorus in Media<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_263_1" id="target_note_LCL322_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and Vologeses at Ecbatana<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_263_2" id="target_note_LCL322_263_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—the latter not inattentive to his brother; for he had even requested Corbulo by special couriers that Tiridates should be exposed to none of the outward signs of vassalage, should not give up his sword,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_263_3" id="target_note_LCL322_263_3"><sup>3</sup></a> should not be debarred from embracing the provincial governors or be left to stand and wait at their doors, and in Rome should receive equal distinction with the consuls. Evidently, accustomed as he was to foreign pride, he lacked all knowledge of ourselves who prize the essentials of sovereignty and ignore its vanities.</p>
<p>XXXII. In the same year, the Caesar placed the tribes of the Maritime Alps<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_263_4" id="target_note_LCL322_263_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in possession of Latin privileges.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_263_5" id="target_note_LCL322_263_5"><sup>5</sup></a> To the Roman knights he assigned a place in the Circus in front of the popular seats—up
to that date, the orders entered indiscriminately<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_263_6a" id="target_note_LCL322_263_6a"><sup>6</sup></a>
