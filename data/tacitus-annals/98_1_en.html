The former moved that the elections should determine the magistrates for the next five years,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_437_1" id="target_note_LCL249_437_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and that legionary commanders, serving in that capacity before holding the praetor-ship, should become praetors designate at once, the emperor nominating twelve candidates for each year. There was no doubt that the proposal went deeper than this, and trespassed on the arcana of sovereignty. Tiberius, however, replied by treating it as an extension of his own prerogative:—“To his moderate temper it was an ungrateful task to mete out so many appointments and disappointments. Even on the annual system, it was difficult to avoid offences, though hope of office in the near future softened the rebuff: how much odium must he incur from those whom he threw aside for above five years!

At the first, however, all magistracies for the next five years would be allotted; at the second (held in the following year) those for the fifth year from that date; and so indefinitely. But, if the holders of all magistracies were unalterably predetermined for five years, the result must obviously be not only to fetter the inclinations of the sovereign to an appreciable extent, but to render the prospective officials, whose position was secured in advance, considerably less pliant than would otherwise have been the case.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL249_437_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
