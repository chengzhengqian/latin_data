at no great distance of time Piso had been lost to the Calpurnii and Lepida to the Aemilii) there was some consolation in the return of Decimus Silanus to the Junian family. His mischance deserves a brief retrospect. Fortune, staunch to the deified Augustus in his public life, was less propitious to him at home, owing to the incontinence of his daughter and granddaughter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_561_1" id="target_note_LCL249_561_1"><sup>1</sup></a> whom he expelled from the capital while penalizing their adulterers by death or banishment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_561_2" id="target_note_LCL249_561_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For designating as he did the besetting sin of both the sexes by the harsh appellations of sacrilege and treason, he overstepped both the mild penalties of an earlier day and those of his own laws.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_561_3" id="target_note_LCL249_561_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But the fate of other delinquents I shall record together with the general history of that age, should I achieve the task I have set before me and be spared for yet other themes. Decimus Silanus, the lawless lover of Augustus’ granddaughter, though subjected to no harsher penalty than forfeiture of the imperial friendship, realized that the implication was exile; nor was it until the accession of Tiberius that he ventured to appeal to the senate and sovereign through his influential brother, Marcus Silanus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_561_4" id="target_note_LCL249_561_4"><sup>4</sup></a> whose high descent and eloquence gave him a commanding position. Even so, while Silanus was expressing his gratitude before the senate, Tiberius replied that “he also was glad that his brother had returned from his distant pilgrimage: he had an indefeasible right to do so, as he had been exiled neither by resolution of the senate nor by form of law. At the same time, he retained his father’s objections to him intact; and the repatriation of Silanus had not cancelled the wishes of Augustus.”
