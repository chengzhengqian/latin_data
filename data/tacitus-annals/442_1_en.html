<p>XXXIII. The same year saw many on their trial. Publius Celer, one of the number, indicted by the province of Asia, the Caesar could not absolve: he therefore held the case in abeyance until the defendant died of old age; for in his murder (already recorded)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_55_1" id="target_note_LCL322_55_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of the proconsul Silanus, Celer had to his credit a crime of sufficient magnitude to cover the rest of his delinquencies. A charge had been laid by the Cilicians against Cossutianus Capito,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_55_2" id="target_note_LCL322_55_2"><sup>2</sup></a> a questionable and repulsive character, who had assumed that the same chartered insolence which he had exhibited in the capital would be permitted in a province. Beaten, however, by the tenacity of the prosecution, he finally threw up his defence, and was sentenced under the law of extortion. On behalf of Eprius Marcellus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_55_3" id="target_note_LCL322_55_3"><sup>3</sup></a> from whom the Lycians were claiming reparation, intrigue was so effective that a number of his accusers were penalized by exile, on the ground that they had endangered an innocent man.</p>
<p>XXXIV. With Nero a third time consul, Valerius<span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">a.v.c.</span> 811 = <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 58</span> Messala entered upon office as his colleague, his great-grandfather,
the orator Corvinus, being remembered
now by only a few of old men as associated in the same magistracy with the deified Augustus, grandfather of Nero in the third degree. The honour, however, of a noble family received some increment in a yearly subsidy of five hundred thousand sesterces, on which Messala might support an honest poverty. An annual stipend was also assigned by the emperor to Aurelius Cotta and Haterius Antoninus, though they had dissipated their family estates in profligacy.
