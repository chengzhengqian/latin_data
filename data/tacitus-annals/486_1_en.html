Caesar had proved victorious.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_143_1" id="target_note_LCL322_143_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The Greek dress, in which a great number of spectators had figured during the festival, immediately went out of vogue.</p>
<p>XXII. Meanwhile, a comet blazed into view—in the opinion of the crowd, an apparition boding change to monarchies. Hence, as though Nero were already dethroned, men began to inquire on whom the next choice should fall; and the name in all mouths was that of Rubellius Plautus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_143_2" id="target_note_LCL322_143_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who, on the mother’s side, drew his nobility from the Julian house. Personally, he cherished the views of an older generation: his bearing was austere, his domestic life being pure and secluded; and the retirement which his fears led him to seek had only brought him an accession of fame. The rumours gained strength from the interpretation—suggested by equal credulity—which was placed upon a flash of lightning. Because, while Nero dined by the Simbruine lakes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_143_3" id="target_note_LCL322_143_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in the villa known as the Sublaqueum, the banquet had been struck and the table shivered; and because the accident had occurred on the confines of Tibur, the town from which Plautus derived his origin on the father’s side,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_143_4" id="target_note_LCL322_143_4"><sup>4</sup></a> a belief spread that he was the candidate marked out by the will of deity; and he found numerous supporters in the class of men who nurse the eager and generally delusive ambition to be the earliest parasites of a new and precarious power. Nero, therefore, perturbed by the reports, drew up a letter to Plautus, advising him “to consult the peace of the capital and extricate himself from the scandal-mongers: he had family estates in Asia, where he could enjoy his youth in safety and quiet.” To Asia, accordingly, he retired with his wife Antistia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_143_5" id="target_note_LCL322_143_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and a few of his intimate friends.</p>
