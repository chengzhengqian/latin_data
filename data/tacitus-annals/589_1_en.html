The senators Vulcacius Tullinus and Cornelius Marcellus were brought in as accomplices, with the Roman knight Calpurnius Fabatus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_349_1" id="target_note_LCL322_349_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Their imminent condemnation they cheated by appealing to the emperor, and later, as being of minor importance, made good their escape from Nero, now fully occupied by crimes of the first magnitude.</p>
<p>IX. Then, by decree of the senate, sentences of exile were registered against Cassius and Silanus: on the case of Lepida the Caesar was to pronounce.

Sextia, and his daughter Pollitta,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_349_5" id="target_note_LCL322_349_5"><sup>5</sup></a> met their doom: they were loathed by the emperor, who took their life to be a standing protest against the slaying
