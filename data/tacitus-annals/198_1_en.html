Public munificence was a custom still; nor had Augustus debarred a Taurus, a Philippus, or a Balbus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_637_2" id="target_note_LCL249_637_2"><sup>2</sup></a> from devoting the trophies of his arms or the overflow of his wealth to the greater splendour of the capital and the glory of posterity: and now Lepidus, a man of but moderate fortune, followed in their steps by renovating the famous edifice of his fathers. On the other hand, the rebuilding of the Theatre of Pompey, destroyed by a casual fire, was undertaken by the Caesar, on the ground that no member of the family was equal to the task of restoration: the name of Pompey was, however, to remain.

By all accounts, no insult to himself and the nation ever stung the emperor
