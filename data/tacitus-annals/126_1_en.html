<p>LXVIII. About this time, Vonones—whose sequestration in Cilicia I have mentioned<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_493_2" id="target_note_LCL249_493_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—attempted by bribing his warders to escape into Armenia, then to the Albani,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_493_3" id="target_note_LCL249_493_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the Heniochi,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_493_3" id="target_note_LCL249_493_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and his relative, the king of Scythia.
