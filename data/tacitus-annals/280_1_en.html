<p>V. 7. He now spent part of the day in detaining or dismissing his visitors, as each was inclined to take his leave or to speak with him; and while the gathering was still thronged, while all eyes were fixed on his intrepid countenance, and the belief prevailed that some time remained before the last act, he fell on a sword which he had concealed in the fold of his dress. No accusation or calumny from the Caesar, who had laid many revolting charges against Blaesus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_149_1" id="target_note_LCL312_149_1"><sup>1</sup></a> followed him to the grave.</p>
<p>V. 8. Next, Publius Vitellius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_149_2" id="target_note_LCL312_149_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Pomponius Secundus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_149_3" id="target_note_LCL312_149_3"><sup>3</sup></a> came under discussion. The first-named was accused by the informers of offering the keys of the treasury,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_149_4" id="target_note_LCL312_149_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of which he was prefect, together with the army fund, to the cause of revolution: against the latter the offence alleged by the ex-praetor Considius was his friendship with Aelius Gallus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_149_5" id="target_note_LCL312_149_5"><sup>5</sup></a> who after the execution of Sejanus had taken shelter in Pomponius’ garden as his surest resource. Their only help in the hour of danger was in the firmness of their brothers, who came forward as securities. Later, as adjournment followed adjournment, Vitellius, anxious to be rid alike of hope and fear, asked for a pen-knife on the ground that he wished to write, slightly incised an artery, and in the sickness of his heart made an end of life. On the other hand, Pomponius, a man of great refinement of character and shining talents,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_149_6" id="target_note_LCL312_149_6"><sup>6</sup></a> bore the reverses of fortune with equanimity and outlived Tiberius.</p>
