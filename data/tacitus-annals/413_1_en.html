Agrippina was in consternation: as the last consequences were to be apprehended, immediate infamy would have to be braved; and she fell back on the complicity—which she had already assured—of the doctor Xenophon. He, it is believed, under cover of assisting the emperor’s struggles to vomit, plunged a feather, dipped in a quick poison, down his throat: for he was well aware that crimes of the first magnitude are begun with peril and consummated with profit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_415_2" id="target_note_LCL312_415_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
