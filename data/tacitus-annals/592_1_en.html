of June was due to the fact that already the execution of two Torquati for their crimes had made “Junius”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_355_1" id="target_note_LCL322_355_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a sinister name.</p>
<p>XIII. Upon this year, disgraced by so many deeds of shame, Heaven also set its mark by tempest and by disease. Campania was wasted by a whirlwind, which far and wide wrecked the farms, the fruit trees, and the crops, and carried its fury to the neighbourhood of the capital, where all classes of men were being decimated by a deadly epidemic. No outward sign of a distempered air was visible. Yet the houses were filled with lifeless bodies, the streets with funerals. Neither sex nor age gave immunity from danger; slaves and the free-born populace alike were summarily cut down, amid the laments of their wives and children, who, themselves infected while tending or mourning the victims, were often burnt upon the same pyre. Knights and senators, though they perished on all hands, were less deplored—as if, by undergoing the common lot, they were cheating the ferocity of the emperor.</p>
<p>In the same year, levies were held in Narbonese Gaul, Africa, and Asia, to recruit the legions of Illyricum, in which all men incapacitated by age or sickness were being discharged the service. The emperor alleviated the disaster at Lugdunum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_355_2a" id="target_note_LCL322_355_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> by a grant of four million sesterces to repair the town’s losses: the same amount which Lugdunum had previously offered in aid of the misfortunes of the capital.</p>
