The former were quelled by the legate Acilius Aviola, who called out a cohort on garrison duty at Lugdunum:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_589_1" id="target_note_LCL249_589_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the Turoni were crus ed by a body of legionaries sent by Visellius Varro, the legate of Lower Germany. The commander was again Aviola, supported by several Gaulish chieftains, who brought up auxiliaries with the intention of screening their defection for the moment and unmasking it at a more favourable juncture.
