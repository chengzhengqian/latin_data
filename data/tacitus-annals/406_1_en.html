<p>LVIII. In the consulate of Decimus Junius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_401_1" id="target_note_LCL312_401_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and<span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">a.v.c</span> 806 = <span class="sc">a.d</span>.53</span>
Quintus Haterius, Nero, at the age of sixteen, received in marriage the emperor’s daughter Octavia. Desirous to shine by his liberal accomplishments and by a character for eloquence, he took up the cause of Ilium, enlarged with grace on the Trojan descent of the Roman nation; on Aeneas, the progenitor of the Julian line; on other traditions not too far removed from fable; and secured the release of the community from all public obligations. By his advocacy, again, the colony of Bononia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_401_2" id="target_note_LCL312_401_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which had been destroyed by fire, was assisted with a grant of ten million sesterces; the Rhodians recovered their liberties, so often forfeited or confirmed as the balance varied between their military services abroad or their seditious offences at home; and Apamea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_401_3" id="target_note_LCL312_401_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which had suffered from an earthquake shock, was relieved from its tribute for the next five years.</p>
<p>LIX. Claudius, in contrast, was being forced to a display of sheer cruelty, still by the machinations of Agrippina. Statilius Taurus, whose wealth was famous, and whose gardens aroused her cupidity, she ruined with an accusation brought by Tarquitius Priscus. He had been the legate of Taurus when he was governing Asia with proconsular powers, and now on their return charged him with a few acts of malversation, but more seriously with addiction to magical superstitions. Without tolerating longer a lying accuser and an unworthy humiliation, Taurus took his own life before the verdict of the senate. Tarquitius, none the less, was expelled from the curia—a point which the Fathers, in their detestation of the informer, carried in the teeth of Agrippina’s intrigues.</p>
