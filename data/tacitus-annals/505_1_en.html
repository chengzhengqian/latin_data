The measure was vetoed by the emperor, lest gratuitous cruelty should aggravate a primitive custom which mercy had failed to temper.</p>
<p>XLVI. Under the same consulate, Tarquitius Priscus was found guilty of extortion, at the suit of the Bithynians, much to the joy of the senate, which remembered his accusation of Statilius Taurus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_181_2" id="target_note_LCL322_181_2"><sup>2</sup></a> his own proconsul.

So true was this that Nero, indisposed and surrounded by sycophants predicting the dissolution of the empire, should he go the way of fate, answered that the nation had a resource. To the further inquiry, where that resource was specially to be found, he subjoined: “In Memmius Regulus.” Yet Regulus survived: he was shielded by his quietude of life; he sprang from a recently ennobled family; and his modest fortune aroused no envy.—In the course of the year, Nero consecrated a gymnasium,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_181_6" id="target_note_LCL322_181_6"><sup>6</sup></a> oil being supplied to the equestrian and senatorial orders—a Greek form of liberality.</p>
