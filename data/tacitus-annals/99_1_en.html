<p>XXXVII. In addition, he gave monetary help to several senators; so that it was the more surprising when he treated the application of the young noble, Marcus Hortalus, with a superciliousness uncalled for in view of his clearly straitened circumstances. He was a grandson of the orator Hortensius; and the late Augustus, by the grant of a million sesterces,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_439_1" id="target_note_LCL249_439_1"><sup>1</sup></a> had induced him to marry and raise a family, in order to save his famous house from extinction. With his four sons, then, standing before the threshold of the Curia, he awaited his turn to speak; then, directing his gaze now to the portrait of Hortensius among the orators (the senate was meeting in the Palace),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_439_2" id="target_note_LCL249_439_2"><sup>2</sup></a> now to that of Augustus, he opened in the following manner:—“Conscript Fathers, these children whose number and tender age you see for yourselves, became mine not from any wish of my own, but because the emperor so advised, and because, at the same time, my ancestors had earned the right to a posterity. For to me, who in this changed world had been able to inherit nothing and acquire nothing,—not money, nor popularity, nor eloquence, that general birthright of our house,—to me it seemed enough if my slender means were neither a disgrace to myself nor a burden to my neighbour. At the command of the sovereign, I took a wife; and here you behold the stock of so many consuls, the offspring of so many dictators!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL249_439_3" id="target_note_LCL249_439_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I say it, not to awaken odium, but to woo compassion. Some day, Caesar, under your happy sway, they will wear whatever honours you have chosen to bestow: in the meantime, rescue from beggary the great-grandsons of Quintus Hortensius, the fosterlings of the deified Augustus!”</p>
