<p>LX. Several times in this year, the emperor was heard to remark that judgments given by his procurators<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_403_1" id="target_note_LCL312_403_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ought to have as much validity as if the ruling had come from himself. In order that the opinion should not be taken as a chance indiscretion, provision—more extensive and fuller than previously—was made to that effect by a senatorial decree as well. For an order of the deified Augustus had conferred judicial powers on members of the equestrian order, holding the government of Egypt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_403_2" id="target_note_LCL312_403_2"><sup>2</sup></a> their decisions to rank as though they had been formulated by the national magistrates. Later, both in other provinces and in Rome, a large number of cases till then falling under the cognizance of the praetors<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_403_3a" id="target_note_LCL312_403_3a"><sup>3a</sup></a> were similarly transferred; and now Claudius handed over in full the judicial power so often disputed by sedition or by arms—when, for instance, the Sempronian rogations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_403_4" id="target_note_LCL312_403_4"><sup>4</sup></a> placed the equestrian order in possession of the courts; or the Servilian laws retroceded those courts to the senate; or when, in the days of Marius and Sulla, the question actually became a main ground of hostilities. But the competition was then between class and class, and the results of victory were universally valid.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_403_5" id="target_note_LCL312_403_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Gaius
