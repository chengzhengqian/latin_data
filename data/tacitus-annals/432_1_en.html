<p>XX. The night was well advanced, and Nero was protracting it over his wine, when Paris—accustomed ordinarily about this hour to add life to the imperial debauch, but now composed to melancholy—entered the room, and by exposing the indictment in detail so terrified his auditor that he decided not merely to kill his mother and Plautus but even to remove Burrus from his command, on the ground that he owed his promotion to Agrippina and was now paying his debt. According to Fabius Rusticus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_35_1" id="target_note_LCL322_35_1"><sup>1</sup></a> letters patent to Caecina Tuscus, investing him with the charge of the praetorian cohorts, were actually written, but by the intervention of Seneca the post was saved for Burrus.

For myself, where the authorities are unanimous, I shall follow them: if their versions disagree, I shall record them under the names of their sponsors.—Unnerved and eager for the execution of his mother, Nero was not to be delayed, until Burrus promised that, if her guilt was proved, death should follow. “But,” he added, “any person whatsoever, above all a parent, would have to be allowed the opportunity of defence; and here no accusers were present; only a solitary voice, and that borne from the house of an enemy. Let him take into consideration the darkness, the wakeful night spent in conviviality, the whole of the circumstances, so conducive to rashness and unreason.”</p>
