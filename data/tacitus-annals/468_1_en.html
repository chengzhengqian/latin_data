<h2><span class="ac">Book XIV</span></h2>
<p>I. <span class="sc">In</span> the consular year of Gaius Vipstanius and <span class="sc">a. v. c.</span> 812 = <span class="sc">a. d.</span> 59 Gaius Fonteius, Nero postponed no further the long-contemplated crime: for a protracted term of empire had consolidated his boldness, and day by day he burned more hotly with love for Poppaea; who, hopeless of wedlock for herself and divorce for Octavia so long as Agrippina lived, plied the sovereign with frequent reproaches and occasional raillery, styling him “the ward, dependent on alien orders, who was neither the empire’s master nor his own. For why was her wedding deferred? Her face, presumably, and her grandsires with their triumphs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_107_1" id="target_note_LCL322_107_1"><sup>1</sup></a> did not give satisfaction—or was the trouble her fecundity<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_107_2" id="target_note_LCL322_107_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and truth of heart? No, it was feared that, as a wife at all events, she might disclose the wrongs of the Fathers, the anger of the nation against the pride and greed of his mother! But, if Agrippina could tolerate no daughter-in-law but one inimical to her son, then let her be restored to her married life with Otho: she would go to any corner of earth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_107_3" id="target_note_LCL322_107_3"><sup>3</sup></a> where she could hear the emperor’s ignominy rather than view it and be entangled in his perils.” To these and similar attacks, pressed home by tears and adulterous art, no opposition was offered: all men yearned for the breaking of the mother’s power; none credited that the hatred of the son would go the full way to murder.</p>
