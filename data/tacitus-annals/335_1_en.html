business was neglected in proportion as a man applied himself to the affairs of others. Many supported themselves by military service; not a few by the cultivation of their estates: no man embraced any avocation, unless he had made sure that it would yield him a return. It was easy for Asinius and Messala, glutted with the prizes of the duel between Antony and Augustus, or for the heirs of wealthy houses—Aeserninus, Arruntius, and their like—to assume a pose of magnanimity: they had themselves obvious precedents in the rewards for which Publius Clodius or Gaius Curio<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_259_1" id="target_note_LCL312_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a> were in the habit of delivering their harangues. Personally, they were senators of modest means, who, in a tranquil state, sought none but the emoluments of peace: Let him consider also the common people who won distinction by the gown! If the rewards of the art they studied were annulled, the art too would perish.”—The emperor, who considered that these arguments, if less high-minded, were still not pointless, fixed ten thousand sesterces as the maximum fee to be accepted; those exceeding it to be liable on the count of extortion.</p>

On the accession of Caligula, even the half-success achieved by Tiberius was cancelled: Mithridates was summoned to Rome and placed under arrest, and Armenia allowed to relapse under Parthian influence or suzerainty. The situation, however, was altered again by the death of Artabanus III. (40 <span class="sc">a.d</span>.) and the outbreak of civil war between his sons Gotarzes and Vardanes, a third brother (Artabanus IV.) having been summarily despatched.—It should be borne in mind that these chapters (8-10) contain, not the events of 47 <span class="sc">a.d</span>., but an epitome of the events from 42 or 43 <span class="sc">a.d</span>. to 48 <span class="sc">a.d</span>.
