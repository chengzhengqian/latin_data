<p>XV. The same year brought still another bereavement to the emperor, by removing one of the twin children of Drusus, and an equal affliction in the death of a friend. This was Lucilius Longus, his comrade in evil days and good, and the one member of the senate to share his isolation at Rhodes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_29_2" id="target_note_LCL312_29_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Hence, in spite of his modest antecedents, a censorian funeral<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_29_3" id="target_note_LCL312_29_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and a statue erected in the Forum of Augustus at the public expense were decreed to him by the Fathers, before whom, at that time, all questions were still dealt with; so much so, that Lucilius Capito, the procurator<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_29_4" id="target_note_LCL312_29_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of Asia, was obliged, at the indictment of the province, to plead his cause before them, the emperor asserting forcibly that “any powers he had given to him extended merely to the slaves and revenues of the imperial domains; if he had usurped the governor’s authority and used military force, it was a flouting of his orders: the provincials must be heard.” The case was accordingly tried and the defendant condemned. In return for this act of retribution, as well as for the punishment meted out to Gaius Silanus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_29_5" id="target_note_LCL312_29_5"><sup>5</sup></a> the year before, the Asiatic cities decreed a temple to Tiberius, his mother, and the senate. Leave to build was granted, and Nero returned thanks on that score to the senate and his grandfather—a pleasing sensation to his listeners, whose memory of Germanicus was fresh enough to permit the fancy that his were the features they saw and the accents to which they listened.
