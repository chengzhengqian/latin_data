<p>LV. The same ground was then seized by the Ampsivarii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL322_97_1" id="target_note_LCL322_97_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a more powerful clan, not only in numbers, but in consequence of the pity felt for them by the adjacent tribes, as they had been expelled by the Chauci, and were now a homeless people imploring an unmolested exile.
