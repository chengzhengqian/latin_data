Lucius Vitellius, after a long period of ages, the bird known as the phoenix visited Egypt,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_201_1" id="target_note_LCL312_201_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and supplied the learned of that country and of Greece with the material for long disquisitions on the miracle. I propose to state the points on which they coincide, together with the larger number that are dubious, yet not too absurd for notice. That the creature is sacred to the sun and distinguished from other birds by its head and the variegation of its plumage, is agreed by those who have depicted its form: as to its term of years, the tradition varies. The generally received number is five hundred; but there are some who assert that its visits fall at intervals of 1461 years,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_201_2" id="target_note_LCL312_201_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and that it was in the reigns, first of Sesosis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_201_3" id="target_note_LCL312_201_3"><sup>3</sup></a> then of Amasis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_201_4" id="target_note_LCL312_201_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and finally of Ptolemy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_201_5" id="target_note_LCL312_201_5"><sup>5</sup></a> (third of the Macedonian dynasty), that the three earlier phoenixes flew to the city called Heliopolis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_201_6" id="target_note_LCL312_201_6"><sup>6</sup></a> with a great escort of common birds amazed at the novelty of their appearance. But while antiquity is obscure, between Ptolemy and Tiberius there were less than two hundred and fifty years: whence the belief has been held that this was a spurious phoenix, not originating on the soil of Arabia, and following none of the practices affirmed by ancient tradition. For—so the tale is told—when its sum of years is complete and death is drawing on, it builds a nest in its own country and sheds on it a procreative in­fluence,
