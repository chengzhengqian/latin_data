Tiberius. It had been as easy for himself to be deceived as for Tiberius; and the same error should not be treated as harmless in one case and fatal in others. His loyalty was inviolate, and, if he was not treacherously attacked, would so remain: a successor he would not take otherwise than as indicative of his doom. Best would be to ratify a kind of treaty, by which the emperor would be supreme elsewhere, while he himself kept his province.” The tale, though remarkable, drew credibility from the fact that, alone of all the family connections of Sejanus, Gaetulicus remained unscathed and high in favour; Tiberius reflecting that he was the object of public hatred, that his days were numbered, and that his fortunes stood more by prestige than by real strength.</p>

Marcus Servilius, a number of Parthian nobles made their way to the capital without the knowledge of King Artabanus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_207_1a" id="target_note_LCL312_207_1a"><sup>1a</sup></a> That prince, loyal to Rome and temperate towards his subjects while he had Ger-manicus to fear, soon adopted an attitude of arrogance to ourselves and of cruelty to his countrymen. For he was emboldened by the campaigns he had successfully prosecuted against the surrounding nations; he disdained the old age of Tiberius as no longer fit for arms; and he coveted Armenia, on the throne of which (after the death of Artaxias) he installed his eldest son Arsaces, adding insult to injury by sending envoys to reclaim the treasure<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_207_2" id="target_note_LCL312_207_2"><sup>2</sup></a> left by Vonones in Syria and Cilicia.

The situation is now roughly this:—In Rome are three members of the Parthian royal house—a son (Phraates) of Phraates IV, and two grandsons (Tiridates and Meherdates). Of the other three sons of Phraates IV, sent by their father as hostages, two have died in Italy; the eldest, Vonones, after a short tenure of the throne first of Parthia, then of Armenia, has perished in an attempt to escape from his detention in Cilicia.—In Parthia, the energetic half-Scythian king, Artabanus III, who ejected Vonones, still reigns, but there is disaffection among the grandees.—In Armenia, the Greek prince Zeno, raised to the throne by Ger­manicus as Artaxias III, is dead, and has been replaced by the eldest son of Artabanus.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL312_207_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL312_207_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL312_207_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Doubtless mentioned in Book V.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL312_207_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
