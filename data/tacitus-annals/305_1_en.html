<p>XXVII. Among all the griefs of a melancholy realm, it was a contributory regret<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_199_1" id="target_note_LCL312_199_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that Julia, daughter of Drusus and formerly wife of Nero, now married into the family of Rubellius Blandus, whose grandfather was remembered by many as a Roman knight from Tibur.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_199_2" id="target_note_LCL312_199_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>At the very close of the year, the death of Aelius Lamia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_199_3" id="target_note_LCL312_199_3"><sup>3</sup></a> whose belated release from his phantom administration of Syria had been followed by the Urban Prefectship, was celebrated by a censorian funeral. His birth was noble, his age vigorous, and he had derived from the withholding of his province an added dignity. Then, on the decease of Pomponius Flaccus, propraetor of Syria, a letter was read from the emperor; who complained that every outstanding man, capable of commanding armies,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_199_4" id="target_note_LCL312_199_4"><sup>4</sup></a> refused that duty; and such was his need that he was reduced to entreaties, in the hope that here and there a former consul might be driven to undertake a governorship; while he failed to recollect that for the tenth successive year Arruntius was being kept at home for fear that he should start for Spain.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL312_199_5" id="target_note_LCL312_199_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Still in the same year died Manius Lepidus, to whose moderation and wisdom I have given space enough in the previous books. Nor does his nobility call for long demonstration: the Aemilian race has been prolific of patriots, and those of the family who have borne degenerate characters have yet played their part with the brilliance of their high fortunes.</p>
