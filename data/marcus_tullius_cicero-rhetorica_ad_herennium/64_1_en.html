<p>Again, the Proof of the Reason is faulty when we misapply a sign designating a variety of things in such a way as to indicate specifically a single thing,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_129_a" id="target_note_LCL403_129_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as follows: “Since he is pale, he must have been sick,” or: “She must have become a mother, since she is holding a baby boy in her arms.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_129_b" id="target_note_LCL403_129_b"><sup>b</sup></a> These indications do not of themselves offer definite proof, but if there is concurrence of other like indications, such signs increase probability not a little.</p>
<p>Again, there is a fault when that which is directed against the adversary can as well fit some one else or the speaker himself,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_129_c" id="target_note_LCL403_129_c"><sup>c</sup></a> as follows: “Wretched are they who marry wives.” “Yet you have married a second.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_129_d" id="target_note_LCL403_129_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
<p>Again, that is faulty which presents a banal defence, as follows: “He was led into crime by anger—or youth—or love.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_129_e" id="target_note_LCL403_129_e"><sup>e</sup></a> For if excuses of this sort are admitted, the greatest crimes will escape unpunished.</p>
<p>Again it is a fault to assume as certain, on the ground that “it is universally agreed upon,” a thing which is still in dispute, as follows: “Ho! Look you, the gods who guide the movements of the beings that dwell above and below keep peace among themselves
