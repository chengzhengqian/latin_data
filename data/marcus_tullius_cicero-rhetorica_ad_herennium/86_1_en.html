The epideictic kind, like the deliberative (3. ii. 2-v. 9 above), receives only a sketchy treatment from our author—evidence of the dominant position which the judicial kind, with its <span class="italic">status</span> system, held in Hellenistic rhetoric. Despite the Epicurean notion that only epideictic was amenable to rules, the judicial kind was in fact the easiest to systematize, even as it was by far the most often employed in Hellenistic times. The Greek term “epideictic” did not primarily emphasize the speaker’s virtuosity, nor was the Latin equivalent <span class="italic">demonstrativum</span> intended to imply logical demonstration. Whereas in both deliberative and judicial causes the speaker seeks to persuade his hearers to a course of action, in epideictic his primary purpose is by means of his art to impress his ideas upon them, without action as a goal. On the scope and purpose of epideictic, and on the discrepancies between our author’s treatment and that of Aristotle (<span class="italic">Rhet.</span> 1. 3, 1358 b), see D. A. G. Hinks, <span class="italic">Class. Quart.</span> 30 (1936). 170–6; cf. also Quintilian,
3. 4. 1 ff., and Volkmann, pp. 19 ff. In the Stoic scheme “encomiastic” was used instead of “epideictic”; see Diogenes Laertius 7. 42. This term, for which <span class="italic">laudativum</span> (see Cicero, <span class="italic">Part. Orat.</span> 3. 10, and Quintilian, 3. 3. 14, 3. 4. 12) would be the Latin equivalent, actually corresponds more closely to our author’s definition of the <span class="italic">genus</span> than does <span class="italic">demonstrativum.</span> Doxapatres (Rabe, <span class="italic">Proleg. Syll.</span>, pp. 149 ff.) argues for the primacy of the deliberative kind, setting the judicial in the second place, and the epideictic (panegyric) last; <span class="italic">cf.</span> Isocrates, <span class="italic">Paneg.</span> 4, <span class="italic">Antid.</span> 46 ff., <span class="italic">Panath.</span> 271.
