<p>Disjunction<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_323_a" id="target_note_LCL403_323_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is used when each of two or more clauses ends with a special verb, as follows: “By the Roman people Numantia was destroyed, Carthage razed, Corinth demolished, Fregellae overthrown. Of no aid to the Numantines was bodily strength; of no assistance to the Carthaginians was military science; of no help to the Corinthians was polished cleverness; of no avail to the Fregellans was fellowship with us in customs and in language.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_323_b" id="target_note_LCL403_323_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Again: “With disease physical beauty fades, with age it dies.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_323_c" id="target_note_LCL403_323_c"><sup>c</sup></a> In this example we see both clauses, and in the preceding each several clause ending with a special verb.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span>Conjunction<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_323_d" id="target_note_LCL403_323_d"><sup>d</sup></a> occurs when both the previous and the succeeding phrases are held together by placing the verb between them, as follows: “Either with disease physical beauty fades, or with age.”</p>
<p>It is Adjunction<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_323_e" id="target_note_LCL403_323_e"><sup>e</sup></a> when the verb holding the sentence together is placed not in the middle, but at the beginning or the end. At the beginning, as follows: “Fades physical beauty with disease or age.” At the end, as follows: “Either with disease or age physical beauty fades.”</p>
<p>Disjunction is suited to elegant display, and so we shall use it moderately, that it may not cloy; Conjunction is suited to brevity, and hence is to be used more frequently. These three figures spring from a single type.</p>
