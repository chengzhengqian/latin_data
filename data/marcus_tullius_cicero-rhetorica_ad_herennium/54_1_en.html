Proposition<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_109_a" id="target_note_LCL403_109_a"><sup>a</sup></a> we set forth summarily what we intend to prove. The Reason, by means of a brief explanation subjoined, sets forth the causal basis for the Proposition, establishing the truth of what we are urging. The Proof of the Reason corroborates, by means of additional arguments, the briefly presented Reason. Embellishment we use in order to adorn and enrich the argument, after the Proof has been established. The Résumé is a brief conclusion, drawing together the parts of the argument.</p>
<p>Hence, to make the most complete use of these five parts, we shall develop an argument as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_109_b" id="target_note_LCL403_109_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

<p>“He saw that, with Ajax alive, his own life would be unsafe; he hoped by the death of Ajax to secure his own safety; it was his habit to plan an enemy’s destruction by whatsoever wrongful means, when he could not by rightful, as the undeserved death of Palamedes bears witness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_109_ea" id="target_note_LCL403_109_ea"><sup>e</sup></a> Thus the fear of danger

According to another tradition this hatred arose from the severe reproof Palamedes dealt out to Ulysses for returning empty-handed from a foraging expedition. The stories of the vengeance also differ. Ulysses and Diomedes induced him to descend into a well in order to find alleged treasure, and then stoned him; or they drowned him while he was fishing; or with Agamemnon they bribed a servant of Palamedes to conceal under Palamedes’ bed a forged letter from Priam offering a bribe of gold, accused Palamedes of treachery, and when the letter (or gold) was discovered, caused him to be stoned by the Greeks.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_109_ea').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
