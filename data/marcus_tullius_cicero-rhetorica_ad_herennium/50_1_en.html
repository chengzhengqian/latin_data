<p>The Exculpation is our denial that we acted with intent. Subheads under Plea of Exculpation are Necessity, Accident, and Ignorance. These are to be explained first, and then, as it seems, it will be best to return to the Plea for Mercy. One must first consider whether it was the defendant’s fault that he was brought to this necessity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_101_a" id="target_note_LCL403_101_a"><sup>a</sup></a> After that we must inquire what means he had to avoid or lighten this superior force. Next, did he who offers necessity as an excuse try to do, or to contrive, what he could against it? Then, cannot some grounds for suspicion be drawn from the procedure in a conjectural issue, which would signify that the deed attributed to necessity was premeditated? Finally, if there was some extreme necessity, is it proper to deem this a sufficient excuse?</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span>If the defendant says that he erred through ignorance,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_101_b" id="target_note_LCL403_101_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the first question will be: Could he or could he not have been uninformed? Next, did he or did he not make an effort to inform himself? Then, is his ignorance attributable to accident or to his own fault? For a person who declares that his reason fled because of wine or love or anger, will appear to have lacked comprehension through fault of character rather than ignorance<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_101_c" id="target_note_LCL403_101_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; he will therefore not justify himself on the ground of ignorance, but will taint himself with guilt.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_101_d" id="target_note_LCL403_101_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Finally, by means of the procedure in a conjectural issue, we shall seek to discover whether he was or was not informed, and consider whether ignorance should be sufficient justification when it is established that the deed was committed.</p>
