friendship, if taken at the right place, is especially effective in keeping the hearers from error and in presenting us, the speakers, as friendly both to the hearers and to the truth.</p>
<p>There is also a certain kind of frankness in speaking which is achieved by a craftier device, when we remonstrate with the hearers as they wish us to remonstrate with them, or when we say “we fear how the audience may take” something which we know they all will hear with acceptance, “yet the truth moves us to say it none the less.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_353_a" id="target_note_LCL403_353_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I shall add examples of both these kinds. Of the former, as follows: “Fellow citizens, you are of too simple and gentle a character; you have too much confidence in every one. You think that every one strives to perform what he has promised you. You are mistaken, and now for a long time you have been kept back by false and groundless hope, in your fatuity choosing to seek from others what lay in your power, rather than take it yourselves.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_353_ba" id="target_note_LCL403_353_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> Of the latter kind of Frank Speech the following will be an example: “I enjoyed a friendship with this person, men of the jury, yet of that friendship—although I fear how you are going to receive what I shall say, I will yet say it—you have deprived me. Why? Because, in order to win your approval, I have preferred to consider your assailant as an enemy rather than as a friend.”</p>

Rutilius Lupus, 2. 18 (Halm, pp. 20–21), uses as an example of this figure the following passage from Demosthenes (<span class="italic">Fragm.</span> <span class="italic">Orat. Att.</span>, ed. Baiter-Sauppe, fragm. 54, p. 257): “But shall I refrain from speaking the truth frankly before you? No, I say. I shall not be silent, because the common welfare demands speech. It is by your own doing, men of Athens, that the state is in such great peril. For you have failed to defend yourselves, by recklessly believing every one and by esteeming as most useful the opinions of those whose counsels are most cowardly.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_353_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
