<p>XXI. When we wish to represent by images the likenesses of words, we shall be undertaking a greater task and exercising our ingenuity the more. This we ought to effect in the following way:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent3">Iam domum itionem reges Atridae parant.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_217_a" id="target_note_LCL403_217_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">“And now their home-coming the kings, the sons</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">of Atreus, are making ready.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>If we wish to remember this verse, in our first background we should put Domitius, raising hands to heaven while he is lashed by the Marcii Reges<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_217_b" id="target_note_LCL403_217_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—that
will represent “Iam domum itionem reges” (“And now their home-coming the kings,”); in the second background, Aesopus and Cimber,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_217_c" id="target_note_LCL403_217_c"><sup>c</sup></a> being dressed as for the roles of Agamemnon and Menelaüs in <span class="italic">Iphigenia</span>—that will represent “Atridae parant” (“the sons of Atreus, are making ready”). By this method all the words will be represented. But such an arrangement of images succeeds only if we use our notation to stimulate the natural memory, so that we first go over a given verse twice or three times to ourselves and then represent the words by means of images. In this way art will supplement nature. For neither by itself will be strong enough, though we must note that theory and technique are much the more reliable. I should not hesitate to
