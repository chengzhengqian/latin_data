<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span>A cause rests on Definition when the name by which an act should be called is in controversy. The following is an example: When Lucius Saturninus was about to introduce the grain law concerning the five-sixths <span class="italic">as,</span> Quintus Caepio, who was city quaestor during that time, explained to the Senate that the treasury could not endure so great a largess. The Senate decreed that if Saturninus should propose that law before the people he would appear to be doing so against the common weal. Saturninus proceeded with his motion. His colleagues interposed a veto; nevertheless he brought the lot-urn down for the vote. Caepio, when he sees Saturninus presenting his motion against the public welfare despite his colleagues’ veto, attacks him with the assistance of some Conservatives, destroys the bridges,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_39_a" id="target_note_LCL403_39_a"><sup>a</sup></a> throws down the ballot boxes, and blocks further action on the motion.
