There is this difference in onset between the last figure and the one preceding: the former moves upon its object more slowly and less often, the latter strikes more quickly and frequently. Accordingly in the first figure it seems that the arm draws back and the hand whirls about to bring the sword to the adversary’s body, while in the second his body is as it were pierced with quick and repeated thrusts.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span>A Period<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_297_a" id="target_note_LCL403_297_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is a close-packed and uninterrupted group of words embracing a complete thought. We shall best use it in three places: in a Maxim, in a Contrast,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_297_b" id="target_note_LCL403_297_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and in a Conclusion. In a Maxim as follows: “Fortune cannot much harm him who has built his support more firmly upon virtue than upon chance.” In a Contrast, as follows: “For if a person has not placed much hope in chance, what great harm can chance do him?” In a Conclusion, as follows: “But if Fortune has her greatest power over those who have committed all their plans to chance, we should not entrust our all with her, lest she gain too great a domination over us.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_297_ca" id="target_note_LCL403_297_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> In these three types a compact style is so necessary for the force of the period that the orator’s power seems inadequate if he fails to present the Maxim, Contrast, or Conclusion in a press of words. But in other cases as well it is often proper, although not imperative, to express certain thoughts by means of periods of this sort.</p>
