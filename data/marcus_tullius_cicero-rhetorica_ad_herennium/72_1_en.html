We can in four places use a Conclusion: in the Direct Opening, after the Statement of Facts, after the strongest argument, and in the Conclusion of the speech.</p>
<p>The Summing Up<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_145_b" id="target_note_LCL403_145_b"><sup>b</sup></a> gathers together and recalls the points we have made—briefly, that the speech may not be repeated in entirety, but that the memory of it may be refreshed; and we shall reproduce all the points in the order in which they have been presented, so that the hearer, if he has committed them to memory, is brought back to what he remembers. Again, we must take care that the Summary should not be carried back to the Introduction or the Statement of Facts. Otherwise the speech will appear to

The Isocratic theory of the Conclusion was also tripartite; to Theodectes (whose rhetorical system was based on the parts of the discourse) its functions are to stir the emotions, especially anger and pity, to praise or blame, and to recall what has been said. See Hugo Rabe, <span class="italic">Proleg. Syll.</span>, Leipzig, 1931, pp. 32 and 216; Anon. Seg. 208–9, in Spengel-Hammer 1 (2). 389; Friedrich Solmsen in <span class="italic">Hermes</span> 67 (1932). 144–151. The Rhet. ad Alex., ch. 36 (1444 b–1445 a), discusses the part played in Conclusions by the Summary and the Conciliation of the Audience (including the Appeal to Pity), together with Discrediting the Opponent. To Aristotle, <span class="italic">Rhet.</span> 3. 19 (1419 b), the Conclusion has four functions: to conciliate the audience and discredit the opponent, to magnify and depreciate, to excite the emotions required by the case, and to review what has been said. Cicero, <span class="italic">De Inv.</span> 1. lii. 98, divides <span class="italic">conclusio</span> into Summing Up, Invective (<span class="italic">indignatio</span>, δείνωσις), and Appeal to Pity (<span class="italic">conquestio</span>);
in <span class="italic">Part. Orat.</span> 15. 52 ff. the <span class="italic">peroratio</span> is restricted (doubtless because the work is in the form of an isagogic dialogue) to two divisions, Amplification and Summing Up, Invective and Appeal to Pity being subordinate to Amplification.
Anon. Seg. 203 (Spengel-Hammer 1 [2]. 454) considers
the Conclusion as dealing with either facts (τὸ πρακτικόν) or emotions (τὸ παθητικόν), placing the Summary in the
former class; so also Quintilian, 6. 1. 1.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_145_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL403_145_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL403_145_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>ἀνάμνησις, ἀνακεφαίωσις.
