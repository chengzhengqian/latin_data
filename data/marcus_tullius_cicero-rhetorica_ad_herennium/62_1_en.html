Again, a Reason is weak when it appears to be presented as the Reason, but says precisely the same as was said in the Proposition,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_125_a" id="target_note_LCL403_125_a"><sup>a</sup></a> as follows: “A great evil to mankind is greed, for the reason that men wrestle with great and many ills on account of the boundless passion for money.” Here the Reason merely repeats in other words what has been said in the Proposition.</p>
<p>Again, a Reason is weak if the causal basis which it submits for the Proposition is inadequate to the demands of the subject,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_125_b" id="target_note_LCL403_125_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as follows: “Wisdom is useful because the wise have been in the habit of cultivating a sense of duty.” Or, “It is useful to have true friends, for thus you may have persons with whom you can jest.” In Reasons of this kind the Proposition is supported not by a universal or absolute reason, but by a feeble one.</p>
<p>Again, the Reason is weak if it can at choice be applied to another Proposition,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_125_c" id="target_note_LCL403_125_c"><sup>c</sup></a> as in the case of Pacuvius, who presents the same reason for calling Fortune blind as for calling her stupid.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_125_d" id="target_note_LCL403_125_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span>In the Proof of the Reason, there are many faults to be avoided in our discourse and also to be watched for in that of our adversaries. These must be considered the more carefully because an accurate Proof of the Reason supplies the most cogent support of the whole argument.</p>
