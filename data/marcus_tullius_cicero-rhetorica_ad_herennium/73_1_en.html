Therefore the Summary must take its beginning from the Division. Then we must in order and briefly set forth the points treated in the Proof and Refutation.</p>
<p>Amplification is the principle of using Commonplaces to stir<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_147_ba" id="target_note_LCL403_147_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> the hearers. To amplify an accusation it will be most advantageous to draw commonplaces from ten formulae.</p>

Note that the <span class="italic">loci communes</span> (see note on 2. vi. 9 above) are here attached to Amplification (αὔξησις), which, in turn, is a subhead under the Conclusion. The theory of Amplification was first formed for epideictic; Gorgias, Tisias (Plato, <span class="italic">Phaedrus</span> 267 A), and Isocrates gave it prominence. <span class="italic">Cf.</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Part. Orat.</span> 15. 52: “The right place for Amplification is in the Peroration; but also in the course of the speech there are opportunities to digress for the sake of amplification, when some point has been proved or refuted. Amplification is, then, a more impressive affirmation, so to speak, which by moving the mind wins belief in speaking;” 8. 27: “Although Amplification
has its own proper place, often in the opening of a speech, and almost always at the end, yet it is to be used also in other parts of the discourse, especially when a point has been proved or refuted.” Cicero, <span class="italic">De Inv.</span> 1. liii. 100–liv. 105, gives five additional <span class="italic">loci</span> for invective; his No. 12 is like our author’s No. 8. There are correspondences between our author’s commonplaces and those listed in Aristotle, <span class="italic">Rhet.</span> 1. 14 (1374 b–1375 a); <span class="italic">cf.</span>, e.g., μόνος ἤ πρῶτος (our author’s No. 8), τὸ θηριωδέστερον ἀδίκημα (No. 7), ἐκ προνοίας (No. 6), ἴασις (No. 5); on correspondences with those in the <span class="italic">Rhet. ad Alex,</span> see Claus Peters, pp. 100–101. Peters, and Octave Navarre, <span class="italic">Essai sur la Rhétorique Grecque avant Aristote,</span> Paris, 1900, pp. 304 ff., illustrate the use made of several of these commonplaces by Greek orators.
