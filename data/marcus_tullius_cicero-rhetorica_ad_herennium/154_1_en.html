<p>XXIII. Such endeavours, indeed, seem more suitable for a speech of entertainment than for use in an actual cause.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_309_b" id="target_note_LCL403_309_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Hence the speaker’s credibility, impressiveness, and seriousness are lessened by crowding these figures together. Furthermore, apart from destroying the speaker’s authority, such a style gives offence because these figures have grace and elegance, but not impressiveness and beauty. Thus the grand and beautiful can give pleasure for a long time, but the neat and graceful quickly sate the hearing, the most fastidious of the senses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_309_c" id="target_note_LCL403_309_c"><sup>c</sup></a> If, then, we crowd these figures together, we shall seem to be taking delight in a childish style;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_309_d" id="target_note_LCL403_309_d"><sup>d</sup></a> but if we insert them infrequently and scatter them with variations throughout the whole discourse, we shall brighten our style agreeably with striking ornaments.</p>
