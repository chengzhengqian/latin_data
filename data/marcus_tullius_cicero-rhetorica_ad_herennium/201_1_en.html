<p>Emphasis by Logical Consequence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_403_a" id="target_note_LCL403_403_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is produced when one mentions the things that follow from a given circumstance, thus leaving the whole matter in distrust; for example, if you should say to the son of a fishmonger: “Quiet, you, whose father used to wipe his nose with his forearm.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_403_b" id="target_note_LCL403_403_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
