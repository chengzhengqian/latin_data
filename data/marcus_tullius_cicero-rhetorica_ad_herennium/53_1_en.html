To be sure, it is in general not hard to devise matter which should serve to support a cause, but to polish what has been devised and to give it a ready delivery is very hard. Indeed it is this faculty which keeps us from dwelling longer than necessary on the same topics, from returning again and again to the same place, abandoning a chain of argument before it has been completed, and making an inappropriate transition to the next argument. By the following method, therefore, we can ourselves remember what we have said in each place, and the hearer can perceive and remember the distribution of the parts in the whole cause and also in each particular argument.</p>

While Aristotle in forming arguments constructs the enthymeme in close analogy with the logical syllogism (e.g., <span class="italic">Rhet.</span> 1. 2, 1356 b), our author, with the practical speaker in mind in this meagre treatment, shows little interest in the syllogistic form. The epicheireme is more complicated than the enthymeme (of which it is a later name). Aristotle’s enthymeme (and, later, also Quintilian’s [epicheireme]; see 5. 14. 6) comprised two premises and conclusion; the epicheireme normally comprised four premises. Aristotle took the premises for granted; the later rhetoricians thought it necessary to prove each. The epicheireme may have developed under Stoic influence. Cicero, <span class="italic">De Inv.</span> 1. xxxv. 61, makes it clear that the quinquepartite epicheireme grew out of Aristotle’s syllogism; Theophrastus, following observations of Isocrates, may have been the first to introduce it into rhetoric. Cicero’s syllogistic form (<span class="italic">ratiocinatio</span>) is logical; he treats it on a par with Socratic induction. See Cicero, <span class="italic">De Inv.</span> 1. xxxiv. 57 ff.; Quintilian, 5. 10. 1 ff. and 5. 14. 5 ff.; Wilhelm Kroll, <span class="italic">Das Epicheirema,</span> in <span class="italic">Silzungsb.

It is doubtful whether the epicheireme as here described was very widely used in actual oratory.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_107_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
