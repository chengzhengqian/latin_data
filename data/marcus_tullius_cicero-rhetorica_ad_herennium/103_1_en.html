satisfied that there is an art of memory—the grounds of my belief I shall explain elsewhere.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_207_a" id="target_note_LCL403_207_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For the present I shall disclose what sort of thing memory is.</p>
<p>There are, then, two kinds of memory: one natural, and the other the product of art. The natural memory is that memory which is imbedded in our minds, born simultaneously with thought. The artificial memory is that memory which is strengthened by a kind of training and system of discipline. But just as in everything else the merit of natural excellence often rivals acquired learning, and art, in its turn, reinforces and develops the natural advantages,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_207_ba" id="target_note_LCL403_207_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> so does it happen in this instance. The natural memory, if a person is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span>endowed with an exceptional one, is often like this artificial memory, and this artificial memory, in its turn, retains and develops the natural advantages by a method of discipline. Thus the natural memory must be strengthened by discipline so as to become exceptional, and, on the other hand, this memory provided by discipline requires natural ability. It is neither more nor less true in this instance than in the other arts that science thrives by the aid of innate ability, and nature by the aid of the rules of art. The training here offered will therefore also be useful to those who by nature have a good memory, as you will yourself soon come to understand.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_207_c" id="target_note_LCL403_207_c"><sup>c</sup></a> But even if these, relying on their natural talent, did not need our help, we should still be justified in wishing to aid the less well-endowed. Now I shall discuss the artificial memory.</p>
