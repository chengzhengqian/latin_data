<p>XIX. Colon or Clause<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_295_a" id="target_note_LCL403_295_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is the name given to a sentence member, brief and complete, which does not express the entire thought, but is in turn supplemented by another colon, as follows: “On the one hand you were helping your enemy.” That is one so-called colon; it ought then to be supplemented by a second: “And on the other you were hurting your friend.” This figure can consist of two cola, but it is neatest and most complete when composed of three, as follows: “You were helping your enemy, you were hurting your friend, and you were not consulting your own best interests.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_295_ba" id="target_note_LCL403_295_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> Again: “You have not consulted the welfare of the republic, nor have you helped your friends, nor have you resisted your enemies.”</p>
<p>It is called a Comma or Phrase<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_295_c" id="target_note_LCL403_295_c"><sup>c</sup></a> when single words are set apart by pauses in staccato speech, as follows: “By your vigour, voice, looks you have terrified your adversaries.” Again: “You have destroyed your enemies by jealousy, injuries, influence, perfidy.”
