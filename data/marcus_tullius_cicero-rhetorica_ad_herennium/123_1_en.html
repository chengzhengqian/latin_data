It is as if a merchant selling purple or some other commodity should say: “Buy of me, but I shall borrow from some one else a sample of this to show you.” So do these very people who offer merchandise for sale go in search of a sample of it elsewhere; they say: “We have piles of wheat,” but have not a handful of grain to show as a sample.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_247_b" id="target_note_LCL403_247_b"><sup>b</sup></a> If Triptolemus, when dispensing seed to mankind, had himself borrowed it from other men, or if Prometheus, wishing to distribute fire amongst mortals, had himself gone about with an urn begging a few coals of his neighbours, he would have appeared ridiculous.
