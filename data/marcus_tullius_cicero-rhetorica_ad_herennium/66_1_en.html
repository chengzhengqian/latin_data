“An informer, in short, is worthy of death; for he is a wicked and dangerous citizen.” The speaker has offered a definition no more appropriate to an informer than to a thief, assassin, or traitor.</p>
<p>Again, it is a fault to advance as proof what has been put in question,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_133_b" id="target_note_LCL403_133_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as if one should charge another with theft, and accordingly declare that he is a wicked, greedy, and deceitful man—and the evidence for this is that he has stolen from the speaker.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_133_ca" id="target_note_LCL403_133_ca"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>Again, it is a fault to refute one disputed point by another disputed point,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_133_d" id="target_note_LCL403_133_d"><sup>d</sup></a> as follows: “You should not be satisfied, Censors, when this defendant says that he was unable to be present as he had sworn he would be.
