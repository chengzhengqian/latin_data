<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>Our Statement of Facts will have plausibility<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_29_a" id="target_note_LCL403_29_a"><sup>a</sup></a> if it answers the requirements of the usual, the expected, and the natural; if account is strictly kept of the length of time, the standing of the persons involved, the motives in the planning, and the advantages offered by the scene of action, so as to obviate the argument in refutation that the time was too short, or that there was no motive, or that the place was unsuitable, or that the persons themselves could not have acted or been treated so. If the matter is true, all these precautions must none the less be observed in the Statement of Facts, for often the truth cannot gain credence otherwise. And if the matter is fictitious, these measures will have to be observed all the more scrupulously. Fabrication must be circumspect in those matters in which official documents or some person’s unimpeachable guaranty will prove to have played a rôle.</p>
<p>In what I have thus far said I believe that I agree with the other writers on the art of rhetoric except for the innovations I have devised on Introductions by the Subtle Approach. I alone,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_29_ba" id="target_note_LCL403_29_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> in contrast with the rest, have distinguished three occasions for the Subtle Approach, so as to provide us with a thoroughly sure method and a lucid theory of Introductions.</p>
<p>X. Now as to the rest, since I must discuss the finding of arguments, a matter that makes unique demands upon the art of the speaker, I shall endeavour to exhibit an industry in research such as the importance of the subject demands—as soon as I have prefixed a few remarks on the Division of the cause.</p>
