Through Presumptive Proof guilt is demonstrated by means of indications that increase certainty and strengthen suspicion. It falls into three periods: preceding the crime, contemporaneous with the crime, following the crime.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_71_aa" id="target_note_LCL403_71_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>In respect to the period preceding the crime, one ought to consider where the defendant was, where he was seen, with whom seen, whether he made some preparation, met any one, said anything, or showed any sign of having confidants, accomplices, or means of assistance; whether he was in a place, or there at a time, at variance with his custom. In respect to the period contemporaneous with the crime, we shall seek to learn whether he was seen in the act; whether some noise, outcry, or crash was heard; or, in short, whether anything was perceived by one of the senses—sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste. For any type of sense-experience can arouse suspicion. In respect to the period following the crime, one will seek to discover whether after the act was completed there was left behind anything indicating that a crime was committed, or by whom it was committed. Indicating that it was committed: for example, if the body of the deceased is swollen and black and blue it signifies that the man was killed by poison. Indicating by whom it was committed: for example, if a weapon, or clothing, or something of the kind was left behind, or a footprint of the accused was discovered;

The tradition thus antedates Aristotle and persisted against his theory of σημεῖον, which joined with εἰκός (the probable proposition) in forming the material of the enthymeme (E. M. Cope, <span class="italic">An Introd. to Aristotle’s Rhetoric</span>, London and Cambridge, 1867, pp. 160 ff.). The <span class="italic">communes loci</span> dealing with the περιστάσεις are akin to the Aristotelian kind of <span class="italic">topoi</span>, but are not specifically Aristotelian. They belong in the Hermagorean system of Issues, but the specific division of σημεῖα into three periods goes back to pre-Aristotelian rhetorical theory (<span class="italic">Rhet. ad Alex., l.c</span>). Neocles (first or second Christian century) in Anon. Seg. 153 (Spengel-Hammer
1 [2]. 379) divides probabilities, signs, and examples into three types according to the same chronological scheme, “as cloud indicating storm, smoke fire, and blood murder.” Σημεῖα and εἰκότα were used by the Attic orators as early as Antiphon, and by Thucydides; see Friedrich Solmsen, <span class="italic">Die Entwicklung der aristotelischen Logik und Rhetorik</span> (Neue Philol. Untersuch. 4), Berlin, 1929, pp. 26–7, and <span class="italic">Antiphon-studien</span>
