The defendant’s counsel will set forth the atrocity of the crime committed by those to whom he is shifting the issue of guilt; he will present before the eyes of the hearers the circumstances, the place, and the time so that they may think that it was either impossible or inexpedient for the matter to come to trial.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_99_d" id="target_note_LCL403_99_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
