whether that matter is in fact like or unlike the matter in question; then whether the absence of a text concerning the matter here involved was intentional, because the framer was unwilling to make any provision, or because he thought that there was provision enough thanks to the similar provisions in the other legal texts.</p>
<p>On the subdivisions of the Legal Issue I have said enough; now I shall turn back to the Juridical.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_91_a" id="target_note_LCL403_91_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span>XIII. We shall be dealing with an Absolute Juridical Issue when, without any recourse to a defence extraneous to the cause, we contend that the act itself which we confess having committed was lawful. Herein it is proper to examine whether the act was in accord with the Law. We can discuss this question, once a cause is given, when we know the departments of which the Law is constituted. The constituent departments, then, are the following: Nature, Statute, Custom, Previous Judgements, Equity, and Agreement.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_91_ba" id="target_note_LCL403_91_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

Thus the <span class="italic">status</span> system as a whole seems to have had no influence upon the jurists, with the possible exception of the doctrines of Letter and Spirit and of Definition (1. xi. 19, 2. ix. 13-x. 14; 1. xii. 21, 2. xii. 17); <span class="italic">cf.,</span> for example, Quintilian, 7. 6. 1.
