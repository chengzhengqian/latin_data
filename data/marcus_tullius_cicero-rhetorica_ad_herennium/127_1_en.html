<p>A discourse will be composed in the Grand style if to each idea are applied the most ornate words that can be found for it, whether literal or figurative; if impressive thoughts are chosen, such as are used in Amplification and Appeal to Pity; and if we employ figures of thought and figures of diction which have grandeur—these I shall discuss later.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_255_a" id="target_note_LCL403_255_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The following will be an example of this type of style:</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>“Who of you, pray, men of the jury, could devise a punishment drastic enough for him who has plotted to betray the fatherland to our enemies? What offence can compare with this crime, what punishment can be found commensurate with this offence?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_255_b" id="target_note_LCL403_255_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Upon those who had done violence to a freeborn youth, outraged the mother of a family, wounded,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_255_c" id="target_note_LCL403_255_c"><sup>c</sup></a> or—basest crime of all—slain a man, our ancestors exhausted the catalogue of extreme punishments; while for this most savage and impious villainy they bequeathed no specific penalty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_255_d" id="target_note_LCL403_255_d"><sup>d</sup></a> In other wrongs, indeed, injury arising from another’s crime extends to one individual, or only to a few; but the participants in this crime are plotting, with one stroke, the most horrible catastrophes for the whole body of citizens. O such men of savage hearts! O such cruel designs! O such human beings bereft of human feeling! What have they dared to do, what can they now be planning? They are planning how our enemies, after uprooting our fathers’ graves, and throwing down our walls, shall with triumphant cry rush into the city; how when they have despoiled the temples
