<p>Again, it is a fault to build upon a name or appellation a dispute which usage can best decide.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_141_a" id="target_note_LCL403_141_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For example, Sulpicius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_141_ba" id="target_note_LCL403_141_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> had opposed his veto to the recall of the exiles who had not been permitted to plead their cause; later he changed his mind, and proposing the same law, said he was offering a different proposal, because he had changed the name. For, he said, he was recalling not “exiles,” but
“those ejected by violence”—as though the dispute concerned the name by which to call those people, or as though all to whom water and fire have been formally forbidden are not called exiles. True, we perhaps excuse Sulpicius if he had a reason for doing this.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_141_c" id="target_note_LCL403_141_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Yet let us understand that it is a fault to raise a controversy on account of a change in names.</p>

Varius Hybrida introduced a law on treason directed against the senatorial leaders; it inquired into the actions of those who helped or advised the allies to take up arms against Rome. Sulpicius’ law in 88 restored the exiles who had been condemned without a hearing either by the Varian Commission or by the court established under the <span class="italic">Lex</span> <span class="italic">Plautia Iudiciaria</span> of 90/89, but was itself later in the year repealed by Sulla. Why Sulpicius had earlier vetoed a proposal to recall the exiles is not clear, for many of these belonged to his own party. The grounds for the veto were probably constitutional, and the new form of the proposal may have been intended to avoid constitutional objections that the decisions of the courts were being nullified; or perhaps popular opinion pressed him to change his mind. It was through the interdiction of fire and water, the symbol of the community, that the capital sentence was carried into effect. See Ernst Levy, <span class="italic">Die röm.
