in speaking each single topic is in general touched lightly, so that the art may not be obvious. In instructing, on the other hand, one must cite examples that are draughted expressly to conform to the pattern of the art. It is afterwards, in speaking, that the orator’s skill conceals his art,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_251_aa" id="target_note_LCL403_251_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> so that it may not obtrude and be apparent to all. Thus also to the end that the art may be better understood is it preferable to use examples of one’s own creation.</p>
<p>Finally, I have been led to this method by another consideration also<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_251_b" id="target_note_LCL403_251_b"><sup>b</sup></a>—the remoteness from our own usage of the technical terms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_251_c" id="target_note_LCL403_251_c"><sup>c</sup></a> I have translated from the Greek. For concepts non-existent among us could not have familiar appellations. The translated terms, therefore, must seem rather harsh at first—that will be a fault of the subject, not mine. The rest of my treatise will be devoted to examples. If, however, these which I have here set down had been borrowed from other sources, the result would have been that anything apt in this book would not be mine, but whatever is a little rough or strange would be assigned to me as my own particular contribution. So I have escaped this disadvantage also.</p>
<p>On these grounds, although esteeming the Greeks as the inventors of the art, I have not followed their
