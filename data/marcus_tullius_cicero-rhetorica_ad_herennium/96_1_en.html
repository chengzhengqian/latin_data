Stability is primarily gained by cultivation; declamatory exercise augments it somewhat, but chiefly conserves it. Vocal flexibility—the ability in speaking to vary the intonations of the voice at pleasure—is primarily achieved by declamatory exercise.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_193_a" id="target_note_LCL403_193_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Thus with regard to vocal volume, and in a degree also to stability, since one is the gift of nature and the other is acquired by cultivation, it is pointless to give any other advice than that the method of cultivating the voice should be sought from those skilled in this art.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_193_b" id="target_note_LCL403_193_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>XII. It seems, however, that I must discuss stability in the degree that it is conserved by a system of declamation, and also vocal flexibility (this is especially necessary to the speaker), because it too is acquired by the discipline of declamation.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span>We can, then, in speaking conserve stability mainly by using for the Introduction a voice as calm and composed as possible. For the windpipe is injured if filled with a violent outburst of sound before it has been soothed by soft intonations. And it is appropriate to use rather long pauses—the voice is refreshed by respiration and the windpipe is rested by silence. We should also relax from continual use of the full voice and pass to the tone of conversation; for, as the result of changes, no one kind of tone is spent, and we are complete in the entire range. Again, we ought to avoid piercing exclamations, for a shock that wounds the windpipe is produced by shouting which is excessively sharp and shrill,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_193_c" id="target_note_LCL403_193_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and the brilliance of the voice is altogether used up by one outburst.
