<p>Students in the rhetorical schools, therefore, in Proving the Reason, use a Dilemma,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_127_a" id="target_note_LCL403_127_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
as follows: “You treat me, father, with undeserved wrong. For if you think Cresphontes wicked, why did you give me to him for wife? But if he is honourable, why do you force me to leave such a one against his will and mine?” Such a Dilemma will either be reversed against the user, or be rebutted in a single term.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_127_b" id="target_note_LCL403_127_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Reversed, as follows: “My daughter, I do not treat you with any undeserved wrong. If he is honourable, I have given him you in marriage; but if he is wicked, I shall by divorce free you from your ills.” It will be a rebuttal in a single term if one or the other alternative is confuted, as follows: “You say: ‘For if you think Cresphontes wicked, why did you give me to him for wife?’ I thought him honourable. I erred. Too late I came to know him, and knowing <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span>him, I fly from him.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_127_c" id="target_note_LCL403_127_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>XXV. Thus the rebuttal of a dilemma of this type is twofold: the first fuller, the second easier to invent.</p>
<span class="marginNote bottom">In the event that the conditions here mirrored are Roman, the daughter must have remained in the <span class="italic">potestas</span> of her father if he divorced her from her husband without her consent. This, then, would be an early reference to marriage without <span class="italic">manus.</span></span>
