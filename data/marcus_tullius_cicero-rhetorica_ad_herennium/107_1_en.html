be of two kinds, one of subject-matter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_215_a" id="target_note_LCL403_215_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the other of words. Likenesses of matter are formed when we enlist images that present a general view of the matter with which we are dealing; likenesses of words are established when the record of each single noun or appellative is kept by an image.</p>
<p>Often we encompass the record of an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor has said that the defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defence we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left tablets, and on the fourth finger<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_215_ba" id="target_note_LCL403_215_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> a ram’s testicles. In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span>the witnesses. In like fashion we shall set the other counts of the charge in backgrounds successively, following their order, and whenever we wish to remember a point, by properly arranging the patterns of the backgrounds<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_215_c" id="target_note_LCL403_215_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and carefully imprinting the
images, we shall easily succeed in calling back to mind what we wish.</p>
