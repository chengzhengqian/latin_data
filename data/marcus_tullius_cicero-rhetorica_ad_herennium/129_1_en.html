Our discourse will belong to the Middle type if, as I have said above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_259_a" id="target_note_LCL403_259_a"><sup>a</sup></a> we have somewhat relaxed our style, and yet have not descended to the most ordinary prose, as follows:</p>
<p>“Men of the jury, you see against whom we are waging war—against allies who have been wont to fight in our defence, and together with us to preserve our empire by their valour and zeal. Not only must they have known themselves, their resources, and their manpower, but their nearness to us and their alliance with us in all affairs enabled them no less to learn and appraise the power of the Roman people in every sphere. When they had resolved to fight against us, on what, I ask you, did they rely in presuming to undertake the war, since they understood that much the greater part of our allies remained faithful to duty, and since they saw that they had at hand no great supply of soldiers, no competent commanders, and no public money—in short, none of the things needful for carrying on the war? Even if they were waging war with neighbours on a question of boundaries, even if in their opinion one battle would decide the contest, they would yet come to the task in every way better prepared and equipped than they are now. It is still less credible that with such meagre forces they would attempt to usurp that sovereignty over the whole world which all the civilized peoples, kings, and barbarous nations have accepted, in part compelled by force, in part of their own will, when conquered either by the arms of Rome or by her generosity. Some one will ask: ‘What of the Fregellans?’ Did they not make the attempt on their own initiative?’ Yes, but these allies would be less ready to make the attempt
