parison is formed from either equivalence or superiority. From equivalence, as follows: “His body was as white as snow, his face burned like fire.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_341_a" id="target_note_LCL403_341_a"><sup>a</sup></a> From superiority, as follows: “From his mouth flowed speech sweeter than honey.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_341_b" id="target_note_LCL403_341_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Of the same type is the following: “So great was his splendour in arms that the sun’s brilliance seemed dim by comparison.”</p>
<p>Synecdoche<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_341_c" id="target_note_LCL403_341_c"><sup>c</sup></a> occurs when the whole is known from a small part or a part from the whole. The whole is understood from a part in the following: “Were not those nuptial flutes reminding you of his marriage?” Here the entire marriage ceremony is suggested by one sign, the flutes. A part from the whole, as if one should say to a person who displays himself in luxurious garb or adornment: “You display your <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span>riches to me and vaunt your ample treasures.” The plural will be understood from the singular, as follows: “To the Carthaginian came aid from the Spaniard, and from that fierce Transalpine. In Italy, too, many a wearer of the toga shared the same sentiment.” In the following the singular will be understood from the plural: “Dread disaster smote his breasts with grief; so, panting, from out his lungs’ very depth he sobbed for anguish.” In the first example more than one Spaniard, Gaul, and Roman citizen are understood, and in this last only one breast and one lung.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_341_d" id="target_note_LCL403_341_d"><sup>d</sup></a> In the former the quantity is minified for the sake of elegance, in the latter exaggerated for the sake of impressiveness.</p>
