Thus Orestes (for the sake of clarity, to adhere to this particular action) confesses that he slew his mother. Unless he has advanced a Justifying Motive for the act, he will have ruined his defence. He therefore advances one; were it not interposed, there would not even be an action. “For she,” says he, “had slain my father.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_51_b" id="target_note_LCL403_51_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Thus, as I have shown, the Justifying Motive is what comprises the defence; without it not even the slightest doubt could exist which would delay his condemnation.</p>

This will be established as follows: When Orestes has used the Justifying Motive: “I had the right to kill my mother, for she had slain my father,” the prosecutor will use his Central Point: “Yes, but not by your hand ought she to have been killed or punished without a trial.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_51_ca" id="target_note_LCL403_51_ca"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>From the Justifying Motive of the defence and the Central Point of the Accusation must arise the Question for Decision, which we call the Point to
