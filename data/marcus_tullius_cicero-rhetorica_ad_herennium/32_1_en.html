First the prosecutor will consider whether the accused has ever committed a similar offence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_65_a" id="target_note_LCL403_65_a"><sup>a</sup></a> If he does not find any, he will seek to learn whether the accused has ever incurred the suspicion of any similar guilt; and it will devolve upon him to make every effort to relate the defendant’s manner of life to the motive which he has just exposed. For example, if the prosecutor contends that the motive for the crime was money, let him show that the defendant has always been covetous; if the motive was public honour, ambitious; he will thus be able to link the flaw in the defendant’s character with the motive for the crime. If he cannot find a flaw consistent with the motive, let him find one that is not. If he cannot show that the defendant is covetous,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_65_b" id="target_note_LCL403_65_b"><sup>b</sup></a> let him show that he is a treacherous seducer; in short, if he possibly can, let him brand the defendant with the stigma of some one fault, or indeed, of as many faults as possible.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_65_c" id="target_note_LCL403_65_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Then, he will say, it is no wonder that the man who in that other instance acted so basely should have acted so criminally in this instance too.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_65_d" id="target_note_LCL403_65_d"><sup>d</sup></a> If the adversary enjoys a high reputation for purity and integrity, the prosecutor will say that deeds, not reputation, ought to be considered; that the defendant has previously concealed his misdeeds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_65_e" id="target_note_LCL403_65_e"><sup>e</sup></a> and he will make it plain that the defendant is not guiltless of misbehaviour. The defendant’s counsel will first show his client’s upright life,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_65_f" id="target_note_LCL403_65_f"><sup>f</sup></a> if he can; if he cannot, he will have recourse to thoughtlessness, folly, youth, force, or undue influence. On these matters . . . censure ought not to be imposed for conduct extraneous to the present charge. If the speaker is seriously
