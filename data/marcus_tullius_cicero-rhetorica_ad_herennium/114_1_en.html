I have written about Style, and wherever there was need of examples, I have used those of my own making, and in so doing have departed from the practice of the Greek writers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_229_a" id="target_note_LCL403_229_a"><sup>a</sup></a> on the subject, I must in a few words justify my method. And that I make this explanation from necessity, and not from choice, is sufficiently indicated by the fact that in the preceding Books I have said nothing by way either of preface<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_229_b" id="target_note_LCL403_229_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or of digression. Now, after a few indispensable observations, I shall, as I undertook to do, discharge my task of explaining to you the rest of the art. But you will more readily understand my method when you have learned what the Greeks say.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_229_ca" id="target_note_LCL403_229_ca"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>On several grounds they think that, after they have given their own precepts on how to embellish style, they must for each kind of embellishment offer an example drawn from a reputable orator or poet.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_229_d" id="target_note_LCL403_229_d"><sup>d</sup></a> And their first ground is that in doing so they are

It reflects the debates between Greeks and Greeks—on Atticism as against Asianism, or the old rhetoric, based on the imitation of the ancients (μίμησις

to whose reliance on the ancients Cicero, <span class="italic">De Inv.</span> 1. vi. 8, refers, and whom Cicero in his Introduction to that work attacks, was doubtless also in the author’s mind. See Paul Wendland, <span class="italic">Quaestiones Rhetoricae,</span> Göttingen, 1914. As our notes show, in spite of the argument in this Introduction, Book 4 contains numerous examples taken (though often with considerable changes) from a variety of sources, both Roman and Greek.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_229_ca').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL403_229_d"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL403_229_d" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">d</sup>Rhetoric and poetry meet expressly also in 4. i. 2, ii. 3, iii. 5, iv. 7, v. 7, v. 8, xxxii. 43, xxxii. 44, and 2. xxii. 34.
