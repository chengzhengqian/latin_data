The pre-Aristotelian rhetoric, represented by the <span class="italic">Rhet. ad Alexandrum</span>, treated the first three (without classifying them); Aristotle would add Delivery (<span class="italic">Rhet.</span> 3. 1, 1403 b), and his pupil Theophrastus did so (see note on 3. xi. 19 below). When precisely in the Hellenistic period Memory was added as a fifth division by the Rhodian or the Pergamene school, we do not know. These faculties (<span class="italic">res</span>; see also 1. ii. 3) are referred to in 2. i. 1 below (<span class="italic">cf.</span> 1. iii. 4) as the speaker’s <span class="italic">funclions</span> (<span class="italic">officia</span> = ἔργα τοῦ ῥήτορος). Quintilian, 3. 3. 11 ff., considers them as departments or constituent
elements of the art (<span class="italic">partes rhetorices</span>) rather than as <span class="italic">opera</span> (= <span class="italic">officia</span>); so also here at 3. i. 1, 3. viii. 15, 3. xvi. 28, and Cicero, <span class="italic">De Inv.</span> 1. vii. 9. ἔργον is an Aristotelian concept (<span class="italic">cf.</span> the definition of rhetoric in <span class="italic">Rhet.</span> 1. 1–2, 1355b), and Aristotle
was the first to classify the (major) functions. Our author here gives the usual order of the divisions; so also Cicero, <span class="italic">De Oratore</span> 1. 31. 142. Diogenes Laertius, 7. 43, presents the Stoic scheme: Invention, Style (φράσις), Arrangement, and Delivery. A goodly number of rhetorical systems were actually based on these ἔργα (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, in most part Cicero’s and Quintilian’s); others were based on the divisions of the discourse
(μόρια λόγου). See K. Barwick, <span class="italic">Hermes</span> 57 (1922). l ff.; Friedrich Solmsen, <span class="italic">Amer. Journ. Philol.</span> 62 (1941). 35–50, 169–90. Our author conflates the two schemes he has in- herited; see especially 1. ii. 3–iii. 4, 2. i. 1–ii. 2, and the Introduction to the present volume, p. xviii.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_7_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL403_7_cb"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL403_7_cb" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>pp. 6–19; G.

See also 4. xliv. 58 (Refining). The divorce between <span class="italic">praeexercitamenta</span> and <span class="italic">exercitationes</span> belongs to the Augustan period.  τέχνη (also παιδεία, ἐπιστήμη, μάθησις, <span class="italic">scientia, doctrina</span>), μίμησις, γυμνασία (also ἄσκησις, μελέτη, ἐμπειρία, συνήθεια, <span class="italic">declamatio</span>). The usual triad, Nature (φύσις, <span class="italic">natura, ingenium, facultas</span>), Theory, and Practice, can be traced back to Protagoras, Plato (<span class="italic">Phaedrus</span> 269 D), and Isocrates (<span class="italic">e.g., Antid.</span> 187; <span class="italic">Adv. Soph.</span> 14–18, where Imitation is also included). <span class="italic">Cf.</span> also Aristotle in Diogenes Laertius 5. 18; Cicero, <span class="italic">De Inv.</span> 1. i. 2. <span class="italic">De Oratore</span> 1. 4. 14; Dionysius Halic. in Syrianus, <span class="italic">Scholia Hermog.,</span> ed.

Philol. Assn.</span> 40 (1909). 185–201. Imitation is presumed to have been emphasized in the Pergamene school of rhetors under Stoic influence. Quintilian, 3. 5. 1, tells us that it was classed by some writers as a fourth element, which he yet subordinates to Theory.
