For it is extremely unjust to give back to nature, when she compels, the life you have received from nature, and not to give to your country, when she calls for it, the life you have preserved thanks to your country;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_373_a" id="target_note_LCL403_373_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and when you can die for fatherland with the greatest manliness and honour, to prefer to live in disgrace and cowardice; and when you are willing to face danger for friends and parents and your other kin, to refuse to run the risk for the republic, which embraces all these and that most holy name of fatherland as well.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_373_b" id="target_note_LCL403_373_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

He gave up his life, but did not throw it away; for at the cost of a very cheap good he redeemed a sure good, of a small good the greatest good. He gave his life, and received his country in exchange. He lost his life, and gained glory, which, transmitted with highest praise, shines more and more every day as time goes on.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_373_e" id="target_note_LCL403_373_e"><sup>e</sup></a></p>
