<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>In the Proof and Refutation of arguments it is appropriate to adopt an Arrangement of the following sort: (1) the strongest arguments should be placed at the beginning and at the end of the pleading; (2) those of medium force, and also those that are neither useless to the discourse nor essential to the proof, which are weak if presented separately and individually, but become strong and plausible when conjoined with the others, should be placed in the middle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_189_a" id="target_note_LCL403_189_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For immediately after the facts have been stated the hearer waits to see whether the cause can by some means be proved, and that is why we ought straightway to present some strong argument.
