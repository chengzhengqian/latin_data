<p>A cause rests on Comparison with the Alternative Course when we declare that it was necessary for us to do one or the other of the two things, and that the one we did was the better. This cause is of the following sort: Gaius Popilius, hemmed in by the Gauls, and quite unable to escape, entered into a parley with the enemy’s chiefs. He came away with consent to lead his army out on condition that he abandon his baggage. He considered it better to lose his baggage than his army. He led out his army and left the baggage behind. He is charged with treason.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_49_ba" id="target_note_LCL403_49_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>XVI. I believe that I have made clear what the Types of Issue are and what are their subdivisions. Now I must illustrate the proper ways and means of treating these, first indicating what both sides in a cause ought to fix upon as the point to which the complete economy of the entire speech should be directed.</p>

Sulpicius Rufus was among those proscribed by Sulla in 88 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> Pursued by Sulla’s horsemen, he took refuge in a villa at Laurentum, where he was betrayed by a slave and murdered. His head was exhibited on the rostra. The slave was set free by Sulla’s orders and then hurled down the Tarpeian Rock. <span class="italic">Cf.</span> Appian, <span class="italic">Bell. Civil.</span> 1. 7. 60: “[Sulpicius
and others] had been voted enemies of Rome, and anyone who came upon them had been authorized to kill them with impunity or to bring them before the consuls [Cornelius Sulla and Quintus Pompeius].” Velleius Paterculus,
2.19, says that Sulpicius and his followers were declared exiles by formal decree (<span class="italic">lege lata</span>). It was forbidden to bury Sulpicius’ body; see 4. xxii. 31 below. If this <span class="italic">controversia</span> was not merely a school exercise, and the murderer was actually called to account, that may have been in the year 87, when Sulpicius’ party again came into power. See the notes on 4. xiv. 20, xxiv. 33, xxviii. 38, xxxiv. 45, lii. 65, and also 2. xxviii. 45.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_49_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL403_49_ba"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL403_49_ba" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup><span class="italic">Cf.</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">De Inv.</span> 2. xxiv. 72. According to the historians, after L. Cassius Longinus in the war against the Cimbri and their allies fell (in 107 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) at the hands of the Tigurini in Gaul, C. Popilius Laenas, legate, made a pact: the Roman survivors would, in return for hostages and half of their possessions, leave in safety. The Roman band went under the yoke of the Tigurini. No mention is here made of the hostages nor of passing under the yoke, nor does the amount of the baggage agree precisely with that in the historical accounts. The charge of treason was made in 106 by the tribune C. Caelius Caldus; a fragment of the defence appears in 4. xxiv. 34 below.
