There remain also ten Figures of Diction, which I have intentionally not scattered at random, but have separated from those above, because they all belong in one class. They indeed all have this in common, that the language departs from the ordinary meaning of the words<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_333_b" id="target_note_LCL403_333_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and is, with a certain grace, applied in another sense.</p>
<p>Of these figures the first is Onomatopoeia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_333_ca" id="target_note_LCL403_333_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> which suggests to us that we should ourselves designate with a suitable word, whether for the sake of imitation or of expressiveness, a thing which either lacks a name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_333_d" id="target_note_LCL403_333_d"><sup>d</sup></a> or has an inappropriate name. For the sake of imitation, as follows: our ancestors, for example, said “roar,” “bellow,” “murmur,” “hiss;” for the sake of expressiveness, as follows:
