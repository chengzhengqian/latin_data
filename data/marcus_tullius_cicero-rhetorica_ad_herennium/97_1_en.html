breath,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_195_a" id="target_note_LCL403_195_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for then the throat becomes warm, the windpipe is filled, and the voice, which has been used in a variety of tones, is restored to a kind of uniform and constant tone. How often must we be duly thankful to nature, as here! Indeed what we declare to be beneficial for conserving the voice applies also to agreeableness of delivery, and, as a result, what benefits our voice likewise finds favour in the hearer’s <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span>taste. A useful thing for stability is a calm tone in the Introduction.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_195_b" id="target_note_LCL403_195_b"><sup>b</sup></a> What is more disagreeable than the full voice in the Introduction to a discourse? Pauses strengthen the voice. They also render the thoughts more clear-cut by separating them, and leave the hearer time to think. Relaxation from a continuous full tone conserves the voice, and the variety gives extreme pleasure to the hearer too, since now the conversational tone holds the attention and now the full voice rouses it. Sharp exclamation injures the voice and likewise jars the hearer, for it has about it something ignoble, suited rather to feminine outcry than to manly dignity in speaking. At the end of the speech a sustained flow is beneficial to the voice. And does not this, too, most vigorously stir the hearer at the Conclusion of the entire discourse? Since, then, the same means serve the stability of the voice and agreeableness of delivery, my present discussion will have dealt with both at once, offering as it does the observations that have seemed appropriate on stability, and the related observations on agreeableness. The rest I shall set forth somewhat later, in its proper place.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_195_ca" id="target_note_LCL403_195_ca"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
