Friedrich Muenzer (<span class="italic">Philologus</span> 89 [1934]. 215–25) believes that the expedition made in 202–200 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> by Philip V of Macedon (Rome declared war in 200) is indicated. Cius was the city on the Propontis in Bithynia. The Rhodians were active against Philip; this passage may come from an actual oration, perhaps delivered, Muenzer thinks, by Apollonius Molo or Apollonius ὁ μαλακός W. Warde Fowler, <span class="italic">Class. Rev.</span> 29 (1915). 136–7, and <span class="italic">Roman Essays and Interpretations</span>, Oxford, 1920, pp. 95–99, thinks the reference is to Lucullus and his fleet in 84 (85) <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, when he was clearing the Hellespont and Aegean of the forces of Mithridates for Sulla. Marx (<span class="italic">Viminacium</span>), <span class="italic">Rhein. Mus.</span> 47 (1892). 157–9, doubts the possibility of establishing the reference. For other conjectures, see A. von Domaszewski, <span class="italic">Jahreshefte der oesterr. archaeol. Inst. in Wien</span> 5 (1902). 147–9 (Lysimachia, in the Thracian Chersonese, and Lucullus), and H. Jordan, <span class="italic">Hermes</span> 8 (1874). 75–7 (Lysimachia, and Antiochus III after his defeat in 191 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> by the Romans at Thermopylae).<span class="linebreak"></span>
Alexander Numenii, <span class="italic">De Schemat.</span> (Spengel 3. 22), cites in illustration of ἐπιτροχασμός Demosthenes, <span class="italic">Phil.</span> 3. 27: “He has gone to the Hellespont; formerly he marched against Ambracia; Elis—that important city in the Peloponnese—he
holds; against the Megarians he plotted lately.” If our author’s example does not come from a speech actually delivered, it may be an imitation of this passage.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_405_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL403_405_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL403_405_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>The reference is to Marius; see W.
