<p>XIII. To confer distinction upon style is to render it ornate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_275_b" id="target_note_LCL403_275_b"><sup>b</sup></a> embellishing it by variety. The divisions under Distinction are Figures of Diction and the Figures of Thought.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_275_ca" id="target_note_LCL403_275_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> It is a figure of diction if the adornment is comprised in the fine polish of the language itself. A figure of thought derives a certain distinction from the idea, not from the words.</p>

Coelius Antipater, after 121 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, dedicated his <span class="italic">Punic War</span> (in seven books) to L. Aelius Stilo. In the Preface to Book I he promised that he would use Hyperbaton only when necessary (Cicero, <span class="italic">Orator</span> 69. 230), but he violated this principle, as here in the Preface to Book II: “In the previous Book, Lucius Aelius, I dedicated to you the account of these events.” Following a normal word order the sentence would read: <span class="italic">In priore libro, Luci Aeli, has res scriptas ad te misimus.</span> Note also that beginning with the fourth word we have a complete dactylic hexameter—an example of epic influence.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_275_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL403_275_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL403_275_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>κατασκευή (sometimes κόσμος), which includes also <span class="italic">gravitas</span> (μεγαλοπρέπεια) and <span class="italic">suavitas</span> (τὸ ἡδύ), as is made clear in 4.

The distinction, here met for the first time, is best discussed by Quintilian, 9. 1. 10 ff. Fortunatianus, 3. 10 (Halm, pp. 126–7), divides figures of diction into the grammatical
(λέξεως) and the rhetorical (λόγου), probably following a Stoic author. The ancients regarded Gorgias of Leontini (fifth century <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) as the inventor of σχήματα. Our author’s treatment is the oldest extant formal one, yet represents a period preceding that of complete systematization (that of Quintilian and Phoebammon). Tropes are considered at 4. xxxi. 42 below; the figures of thought begin at 4. xxxv. 47. The ancient rhetoricians differ sometimes greatly, sometimes slightly, in their definitions of figures, which became excessively numerous as refinements were made in distinguishing them. The line of demarcation between tropes and figures, and that between figures of thought and figures of diction were often vague.
