Adjudicate and the Greeks the <span class="italic">krinomenon.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_53_a" id="target_note_LCL403_53_a"><sup>a</sup></a> That will be established from the meeting of the prosecutor’s Central Point and the defendant’s Justifying Motive, as follows: When Orestes says that he killed his mother to avenge his father, was it right for Clytemnestra to be slain by her son without a trial? This, then, is the proper method of finding the Point to Adjudicate. Once the Point to Adjudicate is found, the complete economy of the entire speech ought to be directed to it.</p>

The Points to Adjudicate will be found in this way in all Types of Issue and their subdivisions, except the conjectural.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_53_b" id="target_note_LCL403_53_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Here the Justifying Motive for the act is not in question, for the act is denied, nor is the Central Point of the Accusation sought, for no Justifying Motive has been advanced.

The complete economy of both speeches must, as I have said above, be directed to this Point to Adjudicate. If there are several Types of Issue or their subdivisions in one cause, there will also be several Points to Adjudicate, but all these, too, will be determined by a like method.</p>
<p>I have taken great pains to discuss briefly and clearly the matters that have had to be treated up to this point. Now, since this Book has grown to sufficient length, it will be more convenient in turn to expound other matters in a second Book, so that the great amount of material may not tire you and slacken your attention. If I dispatch these matters too slowly for your eagerness, you will have to
