G. H. Mair, Oxford, 1910, p. 89, of translating <span class="italic">constitutio</span> (or <span class="italic">status</span> [= στάσις], the term used by Cicero, except in <span class="italic">De Inv.</span>, and by most other rhetoricians) as “Issue.”The <span class="italic">constitutio</span> (= σύστασις, most probably; see S. F. Bonner, <span class="italic">Class. Rev.</span> 61 [1947]. 84–6) is the conjoining of two conflicting statements, thus forming the centre of the argument and determining the character of the case; for a study of the meaning of <span class="italic">status</span> and of <span class="italic">constitutio</span> see A. 0. L. Dieter, <span class="italic">Speech Monographs</span> 17, 4 (1950). 345–69. Our author makes use of the <span class="italic">status</span> system only for judicial oratory, the examples being drawn from both criminal and civil causes. Adumbrated in pre-Aristotelian rhetoric (where it was close to Attic procedure), as well as in Aristotle’s <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span>, it was developed principally by Hermagoras. Stoic and Aristotelian dialectic exerted an influence in its evolution. The terminology and Roman examples show that our author assimilated the Greek theory. His system differs considerably
from that of Hermagoras; see Kroehnert, pp. 21 ff.; Hermann Netzker, <span class="italic">Hermagoras, Cicero, Cornificius quae docuerint de “statibus,”</span> Kiel diss., 1879, and “Die <span class="italic">constitutio legitima</span> des Cornificius,” <span class="italic">Neue Jahrbücher</span> 133 (1886). 411–16; Heinrich Weber, <span class="italic">Ueber die Quellen der Rhet. ad Her. des Cornificius,</span> Zurich diss., 1886; Thiele, <span class="italic">Hermagoras;</span> Walter Jaeneke, <span class="italic">De statuum doctrina ah Hermogene tradita,</span> Leipzig, 1904; Claus Peters, <span class="italic">De rationibus inter artem rhetoricam
guarti et primi saeculi intercedentibus,</span> Kiel diss., 1907, pp. 10 ff.; Kroll in P.-W., art. “Rhetorik,” coll. 1090–5. Cicero’s system in <span class="italic">De Inv.</span> 1. viii. 10 ff. differs from that of our author. <span class="italic">Cf.</span> Quintilian, 3. 6. 1 ff. Most critics see our author as a follower of Marcus Antonius in his system of <span class="italic">status; cf.</span> Quintilian, 3. 6. 45 ff. (note that <span class="italic">legalis,</span> not <span class="italic">legitimus</span> is the term used for the “Legal” Issue by the followers of Antonius), and Kroehnert, <span class="italic">loc. cit.</span> Modern students of Roman Law for the most part think that from the juristic point of view, as against the rhetorical, the <span class="italic">status</span> system was over-intricate and impractical; see note on 2. xiii. 19 below.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_33_ca').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL403_33_d"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL403_33_d" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">d</sup>Hermagoras taught four Types of Issue; see note on Transference, 1. xi. 19, below.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_33_d').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL403_33_e"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL403_33_e" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">e</sup>See Introduction, pp. xxi ff., esp. p. xxiii.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL403_33_e').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
