<p>The scheme of the Conjectural Issue includes six divisions: Probability, Comparison, Sign, Presumptive Proof, Subsequent Behaviour, and Confirmatory Proof. I shall explain the meaning of each of these terms.</p>
<p>Through Probability<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_63_a" id="target_note_LCL403_63_a"><sup>a</sup></a> one proves that the crime was profitable to the defendant, and that he has never abstained from this kind of foul practice. The subheads under Probability are Motive and Manner of Life.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_63_ba" id="target_note_LCL403_63_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>The Motive<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_63_c" id="target_note_LCL403_63_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is what led the defendant to commit the crime, through the hope it gave him of winning advantages or avoiding disadvantages.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_63_d" id="target_note_LCL403_63_d"><sup>d</sup></a> The question is: Did he seek some benefit from the crime—honour, money, or power? Did he wish to satisfy some passion—love or a like overpowering desire? Or did he seek to avoid some disadvantage—enmities, ill

<p>III. Here the prosecutor, if the hope of gaining an advantage is in question, will disclose his opponent’s passion; if the avoidance of a disadvantage is in question, he will enlarge upon his opponent’s fear. The defendant’s counsel, on the other hand, will, if possible, deny that there was a motive, or will at least vigorously belittle its importance; then he will say that it is unfair to bring under suspicion of wrongdoing every one to whom some profit has come from an act.</p>
