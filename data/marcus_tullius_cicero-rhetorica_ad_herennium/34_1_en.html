which of these points is serviceable to the defence, and which to the prosecution, were it not that any one would in a given cause find this easy to determine. For of Invention it is only the first principles which ought to originate in theory; all the rest will readily be supplied by practice.</p>
<p>The Point of Time is examined as follows: In what season of the year, in what part of the day—whether at night or in the daytime—at what hour of the day<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_69_a" id="target_note_LCL403_69_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or night, is the act alleged to have been committed, and why at such a time?</p>
<p>The Duration of Time will be considered in the following fashion: Was it long enough to carry this act through, and did the defendant know that there would be enough time to accomplish it? For it is only of slight importance that he had enough time to carry out the crime if he could not in advance have known or have forecast that that would be so.</p>
<p>The Occasion is examined as follows: Was it favourable for the undertaking, or was there a better occasion which was either let pass or not awaited?</p>
<p>Whether there was any Hope of Success will be investigated as follows: Do the above-mentioned signs coincide? Especially, do power, money, good judgement, foreknowledge, and preparedness appear on one side, and is it proved that on the other there were weakness, need, stupidity, lack of foresight, and unpreparedness? Hereby one will know whether the defendant should have had confidence in his success or not.</p>
<p>What Hope there was of Escaping Detection we seek to learn from confidants, eye-witnesses, or accomplices, freemen or slaves or both.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL403_69_b" id="target_note_LCL403_69_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
