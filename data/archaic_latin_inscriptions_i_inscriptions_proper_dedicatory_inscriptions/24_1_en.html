it was a township with full local <span class="italic">res publico</span>, having magistrates (<span class="italic">duoviri</span>) and local council (<span class="italic">decuriones</span>). Here there have been recently discovered oblong rectangular slabs, twenty-nine in number, and fragments of two more. They were <span class="italic">cippi</span> or <span class="italic">stelae</span> which apparently served as dedicated altars and were placed upright against a wall. They were involved in a fire which destroyed the <span class="italic">forum</span>, at Minturnae about 50 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, and were, after some cutting down, used in the foundations of a temple built early in the first century <span class="sc">a.d.</span>; in the excavations of this temple they were discovered. Each of these slabs was dedicated to a deity by a college of’ foremen.’ These were, like those recorded from the Ager Campanus, annually elected (single persons being re-eligible), one college for each cult. But the colleges consist mostly of slaves<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_101_5" id="target_note_LCL359_101_5">

</a>, few freedmen and only one free-born member occurring; and several of them are colleges of women only. There are no colleges of both sexes mixed. The college in most cases simply shares in presenting the altar, though one or two additional duties are mentioned. If the cults were compital (cf. Johnson, <span class="italic">op. cit.</span>, 122) then the members had to share in the duty of keeping the street-corner or roadsmeet (<span class="italic">compitum</span>) in due order. The basis of election was probably the <span class="italic">vicus</span> (p. xxxiv); we may assume at any rate that the election was done, as in the <span class="italic">‘Lex Ursonensis’</span> = <span class="italic">‘Lex Col. Gen.,’ C.I.L.</span>, I, 2, 594, CXXVIII, by the order of the local magistrates and council; and the dating was by the local magistrates (<span class="italic">duoviri</span>)—in one case by the Roman consuls.</p>
<p>The inscriptions of Minturnae are obviously dedicatory. Those of the Ager Campanus might be classed as inscriptions connected with public works. But even there the records have a religious ‘flavour,’ some of the works being specifically connected with a deity; and it is convenient to deal with them in conjunction with the inscriptions of Minturnae, for purposes of comparison and contrast. (III) Similar records, of Republican date, exist for other regions in Italy and elsewhere; I give some examples.</p>
