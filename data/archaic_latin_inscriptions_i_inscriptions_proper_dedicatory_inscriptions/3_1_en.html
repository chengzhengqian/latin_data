<span class="italic">Caso Cantovios and allies. Bronze plate found in the Fucine Lake. Dialect-Latin or mixed Marsian and Latin. Every other line</span> (<span class="italic">except</span> 3 <span class="italic">and</span> 4) <span class="italic">runs from right to left. Military dedication after a victory, c.</span> 300 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>

<p>Caso Cantovios Aprufclanos [set up] pillars at the Esalican boundary in the city Casontonia; and his allies brought a sacred gift to Angitia on behalf of Marsian legions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Aesuvium); and <span class="italic">menurbid</span> (abl.) and <span class="italic">casontonia</span> (abl. or gen.) would not be Latin. Buecheler (<span class="italic">Rh. Mus.</span>, XXXIII, 490) suggests that <span class="italic">menurbid</span> would be in Latin <span class="italic">monitu</span> (cf. <span class="italic">Menerva</span>, and <span class="italic">promenervat</span> = <span class="italic">promonet</span>) ‘by the advice’ (= <span class="italic">scitu</span> ‘by decree’) and that <span class="italic">casontonia</span> = <span class="italic">casontoniad</span>, an epithet meaning
‘senatorial,’ ‘of the senate’. Jordan, <span class="italic">Ind. Lect. Königsb.</span>, 1883–4, 7, connects it with <span class="italic">casa</span> (a hut, cabin) in the sense of <span class="italic">curia</span> or <span class="italic">conventus.</span> We have in support of this view <span class="italic">Gasuentini</span>
as designating townsmen of Interamna (<span class="italic">C.I.L.</span>, XI, 4209) and certain Etruscans designated as <span class="italic">Casuntinial</span> (<span class="italic">C.I.Etr.</span>, 4203) and <span class="italic">Casntinial</span> (id., 3688; cf. Schulze, 559). However, the engraver may have put his point or dot in the wrong place—an error which occurs in other inscriptions also; if he had been really careful he would not have written his letters <span class="italic">a</span> always as <img alt="special character" class="glyph" src="/view/LCL359/figures/LCL359-p59-g1.png"/>, even in reverse from right to left; and to be consistent he should have written line 4 from right to left; I therefore follow those who read <span class="italic">esalicom enurbid casontonia</span> = <span class="italic">Esalicum in urbe Casontonia,</span> though a boundary in a city is strange and Casontonia is unknown elsewhere as a city. <span class="italic">Line</span> 6: DOIVOM is correct (it was so read by Dressel and Jordan in careful inspections of the plate; Jordan also took a photograph which he compared with the plate) = <span class="italic">divum,</span> but the meaning’ sacred’ is doubtful and it may represent <span class="italic">deorum</span>; not <span class="italic">donum</span> (DONOM), because all other letters <span class="italic">n</span> on this plate are consistently N or its reverse Ͷ.
