</a> ‘hamlets’ (see p. xxxv)
each of which issued decrees, had one or more <span class="italic">magistri</span>
(‘foremen,’ ‘masters’ or ‘overseers’) at the head, and was
gathered round a shrine of its own which in some cases
was at a street corner, in which cases the cult was ‘compital.’
No cult was a state-cult. Of these pagi we know the names
of two—the <span class="italic">pagus Dianae</span> or <span class="italic">p. Tifatinus</span> round the famous
<span class="italic">aedes Dianae Tifatinae</span> on the western slope of Mons Tifata
(Monte Maddaloni north of Capua); and the <span class="italic">pagus Herculaneus</span>
near Capua. The inscriptions <span class="italic">C.I.L.</span>, I, 2, 674, 677–683,
687–8 seem all to appertain to the <span class="italic">pagus Tifatinus.</span> These
and the other inscriptions indicate that the community and
magistri of each <span class="italic">pagus</span> elected each year, for public purposes
connected closely with religion, a <span class="italic">collegium</span> (‘college,’ ‘guild’)
of twelve other <span class="italic">magistri</span> ‘masters’ or ‘foremen’ (quite distinct
from the <span class="italic">magistri pagi</span>, and quite distinct from any sort of
magistrate), one college for each cult. The members of each
college had no official position and were usually all free-born
or all freedmen of the male sex, rarely mixed, never slaves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_100_2a" id="target_note_LCL359_100_2a">

</a>
There were also trade guilds of the familiar type, with <span class="italic">magislri</span>
and having duties connected with a cult. The duties of each
college were to provide money for the treasury of the <span class="italic">pagus</span>
and to give games unless the pagus decided otherwise. They
also made public works such as walls,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_100_3" id="target_note_LCL359_100_3">

</a> pillars, porticoes,
additions to a theatre, sometimes instead of games, sometimes
in addition to these. Dating of the inscriptions, which are on
slabs of stone made for public record, is by Roman consuls.
After 59 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, when the Campanian land with Capua received
a Roman colony, conditions of public life were naturally much
altered, and some change affecting the status of the colleges
or the cults may have taken place because their records cease
to survive. Perhaps the organisation by <span class="italic">pagi</span> became obsolete.

from the ‘Ager Campanus,’ and was an old Auruncan
city which was a Roman colony from 295 onwards. Thus</p>
