<h2>FRAGMENTA DVBIA</h2>
<p class="noindent">Fr. i was assigned to Plautus by Thielmann because it is similar
to <span class="italic">Mil.</span> 439; but the similarity may be purely accidental. Fr. ii
has the name of Plautus after the definition
of the word, which
could indicate that Plautus used it; alternatively, the Plautine
quotation could have been lost in the transmission process.
Fr.
iii–xviii, assigned to Plautus by Reitzenstein, come from Paul
the Deacon but ultimately derive from Verrius Flaccus. They
come from those parts of the original dictionary
that were not
ordered alphabetically (beyond the first letter) or thematically
but according to the author of the quotations; since in each case
a Plautine quote precedes, fr. iii–xviii are likely to be Plautine.
Fr. xix mentions pronunciations of both Plautus and Ennius,
which could indicate that they were common in the early period
rather than that Plautus used these words in his plays. Fr.
xx and xxi are quoted by Nonius, who assigns them to the <span class="italic">Captiui</span>
and the <span class="italic">Aulularia</span>, respectively; since they do not occur
there, one wonders whether Nonius got only the names of the
plays wrong or the author as well. Fr. xxii comes
from Ammianus
Marcellinus, who quotes a <span class="italic">comicus</span>, “writer of comedy”;
Ribbeck identified
this author as Plautus, but without good
reason. Fr. xxiii and xxiv, both attributed
to Plautus by Servius,
could be imprecise quotations of <span class="italic">Amph.</span> 640 and <span class="italic">Most.</span> 767,
respectively.1 Fr. xxv is given to Plautus by Servius, but to
Laevius by Priscian. Fr. xxvi could be an imprecise citation of
