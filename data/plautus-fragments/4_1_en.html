<p class="noindent">Non. 87: <span class="italic">exterebrare</span> means “get something
out with a drill,” both literally
and metaphorically. Plautus jocularly uses <span class="italic">terebra</span>, “drill,” in a
metaphorical sense as well, in a phrase that means “to try to get information.”</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">7</span> that he is taking flight from this area directly</p>
<p class="noindent">Non. 598–99: <span class="italic">protinam</span>, “directly,” is a by-form
of <span class="italic">protinus</span>.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Bacaria</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">What mortal has ever had as great luck as I do, for whose belly
this array of dishes is carried in a procession?
Now for instance
the sturgeon, which was hidden from me in the sea before, and
whose side part I’ll return to the darkness with my teeth and
hands.</p>
<p class="noindent">Macr. <span class="italic">Sat</span>. 3.16.1–2: the sturgeon used to be a delicacy.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Woman From Boeotia</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">1</span> May the gods ruin the fellow who first invented hours, and
moreover the one who first set up a sundial here; poor me, he
tore Day to pieces for me, limb by limb! When I was a boy,
Belly was your only sundial, and by far the best and truest of
them all. When he reminded you, you’d eat, unless there was
nothing there. Now even when there is something
there one
doesn’t
eat, unless Sun sees fit. What’s more, the town is now
so full of sundials, the majority of the population creep around
dry from hunger.</p>
<p class="noindent">Gell. 3.3.3–5: the style of this fragment proves that the <span class="italic">Boeotia</span> was
written by Plautus.</p>
