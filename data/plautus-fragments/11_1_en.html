<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">1</span> Hey you, I’m saying to you what a freedman is said to have
said to his patroness in barbarian lands: “Greetings, Freedom;
get a thrashing, Papiria.”</p>
<p class="noindent">Fest. 512: <span class="italic">barbaria</span>, “barbarian lands,” refers to Italy, and <span class="italic">uapula Papiria</span>,
“get a thrashing, Papiria,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_447_1" id="target_note_LCL328_447_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was proverbial; former slaves who said
this wanted to show that they did not care about being threatened
because they were now free.</p>

<p class="noindent">Diom. <span class="italic">gramm</span>. 1.401: <span class="italic">populari</span>, “plunder,” can also have active endings.</p>

do it; if I do do it, I’ll get a thrashing.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL328_447_2" id="target_note_LCL328_447_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Gell. 3.3.7–8: the style of the <span class="italic">Fretum</span> shows that it was written by
Plautus.</p>
