<h2>DOUBTFUL FRAGMENTS</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Truc.</span> 93. Fr. xxvii could be loosely based on <span class="italic">Curc.</span> 228. Fr. xxviii
could have arisen by a misunderstanding:
Sacerdos (<span class="italic">gramm.</span>
6.491) states that the Plautine <span class="italic">boo</span>, “call,” is a Greek loanword
and that <span class="italic">reboo</span>, “call back,” is a derivative thereof; the text in
Probus could have been based on this passage and could by
accident have assigned <span class="italic">reboo</span> to Plautus. Fr. xxix, attributed
to
the <span class="italic">Caecus</span> of Titinius, was regarded as belonging to the Plautine
<span class="italic">Caecus</span> by Winter. Fr. xxx is considered Plautine by Charisius,
but ascribed to Naevius by Paul the Deacon. Fr. xxxi is
said to be something
that Plautus never said, but this denial
points to a controversy among grammarians and perhaps someone
else assigned the form to Plautus. Fr. xxxii, illustrating the
combination of <span class="italic">cette</span>, “give” (imperative plural), with the dative,
seems to be made up because the dative after <span class="italic">cette</span> in
Plautus is always a first-person
singular pronoun. Fr. xxxiii and
xxxiv violate regular Plautine usage. Fr. xxxv and xxxvi are ascribed
to Plautus by Priscian, but his account is based on Nonius,
who ascribes the forms to Pacuvius and Sueius, respectively.
Fr. xxxvii contradicts the regular usage of Plautus, who
says <span class="italic">flocci facio</span>, “care a straw,” rather than <span class="italic">flocci pendo.</span> Fr.
xxxviii might be based on <span class="italic">Cist.</span> 709 or 655–56. Fr. xxxix contains
a type of hyperbaton not attested in Plautus (noun + preposition
+ adjective). Fr. xl seems to be a conflation of <span class="italic">Cas.</span> 493 and
<span class="italic">Rud.</span> 1325.</p>
