<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">21</span> The man caught by treachery puts his neck to the test with
the fetter.</p>
<p class="noindent">Fest. 160–62: a <span class="italic">neruos</span> is a foot fetter, but in Plautus it is used to fasten
a prisoner’s neck.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">22</span> but I can see pickled fish in metal jars, a good, gray sea
snail, and fish for frying, stuffed
sea urchins, and molluscs from
fishponds</p>

I know you, you ship scribe, you shameless pillory?</p>

“compartment for pigeons/hole for an oar in a ship,” or <span class="italic">columbarius</span>,
“pigeon keeper,” is unclear.</p>
