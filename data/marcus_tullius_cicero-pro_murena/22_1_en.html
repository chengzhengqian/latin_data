the Roman people has ever fought. Lucius Sulla, the aggressive, spirited and, to put it no higher, not inexperienced commander of a large and valiant army, allowed him to depart in peace although he had carried war through the length and breadth of Asia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_229_a" id="target_note_LCL324_229_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Lucius Murena, my client’s father, harried him with the utmost energy and persistence and left him largely contained but not crushed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_229_b" id="target_note_LCL324_229_b"><sup>b</sup></a> After spending a number of years building up his position and his forces, the king entertained such high hopes for the war he was undertaking that he expected to link the Atlantic with the Black Sea and the forces of Sertorius with his own.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_229_c" id="target_note_LCL324_229_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Two consuls<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_229_d" id="target_note_LCL324_229_d"><sup>d</sup></a> were despatched <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span> to this war: one with orders to pursue Mithridates, the other to protect Bithynia. The latter’s operations were disastrous on both land and sea and greatly enhanced the king’s resources and prestige. Lucius Lucullus, however, conducted such extensive operations that I cannot think of a more important campaign or one conducted with greater skill and valour. Mithridates thought that Cyzicus would prove to be the gateway to Asia for him and therefore directed the whole force of his campaign against its walls in the belief that he had only to breach and raze them for the entire province to be at his mercy, but Lucullus’ conduct of the operation ensured that the city of our loyalest allies was saved and all the king’s forces frittered away on the protracted siege. Do you think that the naval battle off Tenedus, when a fleet of the enemy under spirited leadership was making for Italy under full sail with high hopes and confidence, was some half-hearted encounter or trivial clash?
