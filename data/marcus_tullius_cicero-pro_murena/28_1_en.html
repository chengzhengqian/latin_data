embezzlement court; on one side nothing but tears and rags, on the other nothing but prosecutors and informers; a reluctant panel of jurors who have to be summoned to attend and kept against their will; a decision against a clerk and the whole order is up in arms against you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_241_a" id="target_note_LCL324_241_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; a criticism of Sulla’s grants<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_241_b" id="target_note_LCL324_241_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and many stout veterans, almost a class in the State, are your enemies; heavy damages awarded and the plaintiff forgets but the defendant remembers. Finally, you refused to go out to a province.

In Gaul by his justice and untiring efforts he personally enabled our men to recover sums already written off.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_241_e" id="target_note_LCL324_241_e"><sup>e</sup></a> You in the meantime were at Rome and of course, I agree, were helping your friends; but just reflect that the enthusiasm of some friends tends to grow weaker for those whom they see spurning provinces.</p>

The recruitment of troops had provided other generous commanders besides Murena with grateful clients. Umbria, however, brought him particularly valuable support owing to the multiplicity of the tribes in the area. He no doubt showed favouritism of some sort in the levy, perhaps to the richer inhabitants whose votes would count for more in elections. <span class="italic">Cf.</span> R. E.
