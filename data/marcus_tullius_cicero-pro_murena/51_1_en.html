am consul will you be surprised in your sleep. You <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">79</span><span class="br"></span> ask me what I fear in Catiline. Nothing, and I have seen to it that nobody need fear him, but I do say that there is good reason to fear his forces which I see here; and it is not now so much the army of Lucius Catilina that we have to fear as those who by their story have deserted it. They have not deserted but have been posted by him on the look-out and in ambush, and have been left hanging over our heads. These men want your verdict to dislodge from his defence of the city and his protection of the citizen body, an uncorrupt consul, a skilful general and a man bound up by his character and circumstances with the safety of the Republic. If you hand over one of the two consuls to these men whose armed aggression, gentlemen, I have repelled in the Campus Martius, crippled in the Forum, crushed time and again in my own home,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_287_a" id="target_note_LCL324_287_a"><sup>a</sup></a> they will have achieved much more by your verdict than by their own daggers. It is vital, gentlemen, that there are two consuls in the State on the 1st of January and that is what in the face of strong opposition I have worked so hard to achieve. Do not imagine that <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span> those men are employing any ordinary plans or commonplace methods. It is not a question of an unjust law, or ruinous bribery, or the sort of plot against the Republic with which we are familiar. Plans have been laid in this State, gentlemen, to destroy the city, slaughter the citizens and obliterate the name of Rome. And citizens, citizens, I say, if it is right to call them by that name, are continuing to plan these crimes against their fatherland. Every day I counter their plans, I undermine their aggression, I resist their crime. I give you warning,
