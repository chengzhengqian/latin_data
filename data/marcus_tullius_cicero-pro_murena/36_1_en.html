voice the distress that has suddenly welled up within me at Lucius Murena’s misfortune. The distress of others, gentlemen, no less than my own daily anxieties and labours has often in the past made me envy the peace and tranquillity of those free from the pressures of ambition. Today, however, I have been so deeply moved by the extent and suddenness of Lucius Murena’s peril that I cannot deplore strongly enough either the situation in which we all find ourselves or the unhappy course that his life has taken. Firstly, in trying to rise a single step in office beyond the rank attained repeatedly by his family and his ancestors he is risking both what he has inherited and what he has won himself. Secondly, in his eagerness for new distinction he is endangering even his previous good fortune. Painful as this may be, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">56</span><span class="br"></span> gentlemen, the most bitter blow of all is to have as his accusers not men who have sunk to prosecuting him from political enmity but men who have become enemies out of their eagerness to launch a prosecution. I do not include Servius Sulpicius, for I realize that his motive lies not in any wrong done him by Lucius Murena but in their election rivalry.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_257_a" id="target_note_LCL324_257_a"><sup>a</sup></a> But Murena is accused by Gaius Postumus, his father’s friend and on his own admission an old friend and neighbour; he produced a number of reasons why he should be a friend but could recall none for enmity. He is accused by Servius Sulpicius whose father was a boon companion and whose talents should rather have been devoted to protecting all his father’s friends. He is accused by Marcus Cato who has never had cause to be an enemy of Murena and whose birth had given him a position with us in Rome from which he should direct his resources and native talent
