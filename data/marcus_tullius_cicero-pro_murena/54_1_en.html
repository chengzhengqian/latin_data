good our losses or place in which to rise again when we have fallen. Not only must we not weaken the forces we have but, if we can, we must strengthen them with new. The enemy is not on the Anio,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_293_a" id="target_note_LCL324_293_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which in the Punic War seemed desperate enough, but in the city, in the Forum, and—immortal gods! I cannot say it without a groan—there are even some in our national holy of holies, yes, in the very Senate-house. May the gods grant that my gallant colleague smash Catiline’s evil force of bandits in the field!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_293_b" id="target_note_LCL324_293_b"><sup>b</sup></a> I, a civilian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_293_c" id="target_note_LCL324_293_c"><sup>c</sup></a> with your help and with that of all loyal citizens shall lay plans to break up and crush the danger which the nation has engendered and to which it is now giving birth.
