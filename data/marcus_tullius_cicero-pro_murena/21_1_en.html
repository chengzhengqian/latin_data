and their victories hailed with great rejoicing, why do you despise the peoples of Asia and an enemy like Mithridates? Yet I read in accounts of past history that perhaps the most serious war ever fought by the Roman people was that against Antiochus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_227_aa" id="target_note_LCL324_227_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> Lucius Scipio was the victor in that war in Asia and won from it as much glory as his brother Publius won from his victory in Africa; for each took an additional name to honour his success<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_227_b" id="target_note_LCL324_227_b"><sup>b</sup></a> from the scene of his victory. In that war too your great-grandfather, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span> Marcus Cato,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_227_c" id="target_note_LCL324_227_c"><sup>c</sup></a> displayed exceptional bravery; and since, as I conclude, he possessed the qualities that I now see in you, he would never have gone out with Scipio if he had thought that he would only have to fight against a lot of women. No more would the Senate ever have asked Publius Africanus to join his brother’s staff shortly after he had expelled Hannibal from Italy, driven him from Africa, defeated Carthage and freed the Republic from desperate peril, if they had not considered it an important war involving hard fighting. Yet, if you consider carefully what Mithridates was capable of doing, what he actually achieved and the sort of man he was, you will surely rate this king more highly than any against whom
