turned aside from the race for office and had transferred your attention to a prosecution, you could pay proper attention to both. How very wrong you were! Was there a single day after you had set in motion the process of your prosecution that was not entirely taken up with putting your plan into effect? You demanded a law against bribery; but you did not need it, for you already had the stringent provisions of Calpurnius’ law available.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_247_a" id="target_note_LCL324_247_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Your wishes and your standing were deferred to. That law as a whole would perhaps have put teeth into your prosecution, if you had a guilty defendant; but in fact it wrecked your campaign. Your voice demanded a heavier <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">47</span><span class="br"></span> penalty for the commons; the anger of the poorer people was aroused. There was to be exile for our order; the Senate yielded to your demand although reluctant to impose at your request a harsher fate than the common lot. A penalty was attached to the plea of ill-health<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_247_b" id="target_note_LCL324_247_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; this lost the good-will of many who either have to exert themselves to the detriment of their health or in addition to suffering ill-health have to forgo their remaining rewards in life. Who was it, then, that secured the passage of these provisions? A man who obeyed the authority of the Senate and your wishes, the man, in short, who stood to get least from them. Do you think that the other provisions which a crowded Senate rejected at my express request were not particularly damaging to your interests?
