the barriers which had protected nobility for so many years<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_207_a" id="target_note_LCL324_207_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and making the way to the consulship open, as it was in the time of our ancestors, to talent as much as to birth, I did not think that when a consul-designate, the member of an old and illustrious family, was being defended by a consul, the son of a Roman knight, the prosecution would attack his family’s lack of nobility. It was my own experience to have two patricians as fellow candidates for the consulship, one an utterly reckless desperado, the other a law-abiding citizen of complete loyalty. Yet I defeated Catiline in merit and Galba<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_207_b" id="target_note_LCL324_207_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in popularity. If my success were a valid ground for accusing a new man, then I would certainly have had no shortage of enemies or rivals. Let us, then, stop talking about <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> their birth, for in this respect they are equally distinguished.

You all appreciate that, when there are many candidates of equal merit but only one can come first in the election, their order of merit does not correspond with the order in which their election is announced. This is because the announcement of election creates degrees of precedence whereas very often all the candidates are of equal merit. But the lot gave to each a quaestorship of much the same importance. In accordance with Titius’ law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_207_d" id="target_note_LCL324_207_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Murena was allotted a quiet and peaceful province, while you had Ostia which is always greeted by an uproar when the praetors draw the lots.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_207_e" id="target_note_LCL324_207_e"><sup>e</sup></a> It is a province that
