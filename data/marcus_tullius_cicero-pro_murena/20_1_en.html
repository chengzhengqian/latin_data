of yours are dashed from our hands the moment any fresh disturbance sounds the call to arms. In the words of a poet of genius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_225_a" id="target_note_LCL324_225_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and a very reliable authority, at the declaration of war “there is banished” not only your wordy pretence of wisdom but also that mistress of the world “good sense; force is in control, the orator is rejected” whether he is tiresome and long-winded or whether he is “a good speaker; the rough soldier is courted,” but your profession lies abandoned. “They do not go from court to join issue,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_225_b" id="target_note_LCL324_225_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but rather,” he says, “they seek redress with the sword.” If this is so, Sulpicius, in my view, let the Forum give way to the camp, peace to war, the pen to the sword, shade to the heat of the sun; in short, concede first place in the State to that profession which has given the State dominion over the world.</p>

I disagree entirely, gentlemen, but I shall speak only briefly on the matter since it is not relevant to my case. If we are to despise all the wars that we have ever fought against the Greeks, we must ridicule the triumphs of Manius Curius over King Pyrrhus, of Titus Flamininus over Philip, of Marcus Fulvius over the Aetolians, of Lucius Paulus over King Perses, of Quintus Metellus over the false Philip, of Lucius Mummius over Corinth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_225_da" id="target_note_LCL324_225_da"><sup>d</sup></a> But if these wars were major struggles
