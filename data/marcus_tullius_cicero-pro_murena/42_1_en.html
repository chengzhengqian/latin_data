philosophical studies; but experience will soon soften you, time calm you and age mellow you. Indeed, those tutors of yours and your teachers of ethics have, I think, extended the bounds of moral duty a little further than nature intended in order that our efforts of will to achieve perfection should bring us at least to the standards that we should attain. “Never forgive!” No: not on every occasion, but do forgive sometimes. “Never show favour!” No: stand out against it when obligation and good faith require. “Do not be moved by pity!” Certainly not, if you are going to relax discipline; but there is some merit in sympathy. “Stand by your opinion!” Yes, of course, so long as a better opinion does not replace it.

Can you think of anyone, Cato, more affable, more sociable, more inclined in every way to accommodate his fellow-men than your great-grandfather?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_269_e" id="target_note_LCL324_269_e"><sup>e</sup></a> When you spoke with truth and conviction of his exceptional
