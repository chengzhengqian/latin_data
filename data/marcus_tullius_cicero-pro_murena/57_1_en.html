If these are cruel, wretched or lamentable <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">90</span><span class="br"></span> fates, if they are repellent to your mercy and compassion, gentlemen, then preserve a distinction conferred by the Roman people, restore a consul to the Republic, grant this for the sake of his honour, for his dead father, for his home and family, grant it too for the distinguished town of Lanuvium which you have seen represented throughout this case by its sorrowing crowds. Do not tear from the hereditary worship of Juno Sospita, to whom all consuls must sacrifice, the consul who is her fellow-townsman and her own above all others!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_299_aa" id="target_note_LCL324_299_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> Myself a consul, gentlemen, I commend this consul to you. If my commendation carries any weight or my support any authority, I commend him with the promise and guarantee that he will be devoted to the cause of peace, zealous in the support of all loyal citizens, active in the suppression of rebellion, intrepid in war and a bitter enemy of this conspiracy which is now rocking the foundations of the Republic.</p>
