This decree was passed at the request of all the candidates so that you cannot tell whom it helps or whom it harms. Prove, therefore, that Murena employed these practices and then I shall concede to you that they were illegal.</p>
<p>“Crowds went out to meet him on his return from his province.” That is the normal practice in the case of a consular candidate. Do not people go out to meet anyone on his return home? “Who formed that large crowd?” Firstly, even if I could not render you an account of it, does it surprise you that crowds went out to greet the arrival of a man like Murena when he was a candidate for the consulship?
