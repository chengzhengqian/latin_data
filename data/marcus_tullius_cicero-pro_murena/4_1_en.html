not repeal that long standing private rule of mine, to protect my fellow-citizens in their hour of danger. If, however, I admitted that bribery had taken place and argued that nothing wrong had been done, then I should be acting improperly, even if another had carried the law; but since my case is that there has been no breach of the law, I fail to see how my responsibility for the law can interfere with my appearance for the defence.</p>
<p>Cato says that my present defence of Murena is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> inconsistent with the severity which I employed in expelling Catiline from Rome by my speeches and virtually by my consular edict when he was contriving the destruction of the State within the city’s walls.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_193_a" id="target_note_LCL324_193_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I have always been happy to play this role of leniency and mercy which I learned from Mother Nature<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_193_b" id="target_note_LCL324_193_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; I have not sought the part of sternness and severity, but when I had it thrust upon me by the State I have sustained it as the majesty of this realm demanded in her citizens’ supreme peril. If I did overcome my natural inclination and, loth though I was, display the necessary vigour at a time when the State required the use of force and severity, should I not be eager to indulge my temperament and usual practice now that every consideration invites mercy and human feeling? Perhaps I shall have to deal further with my obligation to act for the defence and with the grounds for your accusation in another part of my speech.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_193_c" id="target_note_LCL324_193_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>The complaint, gentlemen, of my learned and eminent <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> friend Servius Sulpicius affected me as deeply as Cato’s accusation. He said that he was pained and bitterly hurt that I had forgotten the ties of friendship and was defending Murena against him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_193_d" id="target_note_LCL324_193_d"><sup>d</sup></a>
