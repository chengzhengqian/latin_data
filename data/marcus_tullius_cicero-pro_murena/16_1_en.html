calendar for the people and out of their own mouths robbed these canny lawyers of their wisdom.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_217_a" id="target_note_LCL324_217_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Angry and afraid that since the list of days was now public knowledge legal processes could be set in motion without them, these lawyers devised certain formulas to ensure that they still took part in every case. When a case<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_217_ba" id="target_note_LCL324_217_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> could perfectly well go like this: <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> “The Sabine estate is mine,” “No, mine,” then a decision, they wouldn’t have it. “An estate,” he says, “which is in the territory which is called Sabine.” That’s long-winded enough, but listen to what follows: “I maintain that it is mine according to my legal rights as a Roman citizen.” Where does that take us? “I therefore summon you from the court to contest ownership at the property.” The defendant did not know how to reply to so long-winded a litigant. The same lawyer crosses to the other side like a Latin pipe-player.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_217_c" id="target_note_LCL324_217_c"><sup>c</sup></a> “Because,” he says, “you have summoned me from the court to contest ownership, I therefore in my turn summon you there.” Meanwhile to keep the praetor from getting too good an opinion of himself and saying something on his own, a jingle was composed for him
