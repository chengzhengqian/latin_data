Apollo with learned Minerva had conferred their arts on thee: thou wert the ornament and glory of both—even as the beryl<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_123_a" id="target_note_LCL284_123_a">

</a> surpasses the common sands which the wave tosses about along with it on the shore’s edge. That thou wert luxurious in mind as in dress is the one slander urged against thee: it is dispelled by thine exceeding plainness of life. So did they live among whom dwelt the golden Maid<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_123_b" id="target_note_LCL284_123_b">

</a> who soon fled into exile from the bustle of mankind. Backbiter, say what harm his loosened tunic did you, or dress through which the air could play? Was he a whit less guardian of the city, and less a hostage for our absent emperor?
