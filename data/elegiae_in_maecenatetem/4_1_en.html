My memory works, and certes I remember that thus arms whiter than the gleaming snow led the Bacchic wands, and thy wand was adorned with gems and gold—the trailing ivy scarce had room thereon; silvern surely were the slippers which bound thy feet: this I trow, Bacchus, thou dost not deny. Softer e’en than thy wont was much that thou saidst then in converse with me: ’twas of set design that thy words were new to the ear.</p>
