even the dirty earth down in the world’s great mass. And all the while the earth stands in its way, yet does not impede its vision. Indeed should it turn its face towards the starry heavens, nothing coming in the way of its eyes checks the flame of the sleepless soul, even though thick-gathered clouds lower and the sky wear a blanket of darkness before it. It is thus that John sees mysteries hidden in the silence of the future while he is yet in the body and not delivered from the flesh but, by the grace of sleep through the medium of the flesh, free for a while to observe, and with discerning eyes travels through time in the settled order of years to come. He sees the angels arrayed in readiness for the destruction of a world doomed presently to be consumed with fire, and hears the dread bray of the stern trumpets at the last day. These things he saw before his death, when still shut up in the prison-house of the body, while his soul separated itself but did not depart. Shall not the spirit all the more without the body observe all things, when its bodily wrappings are laid in the cold grave? It is a sure belief that the consuming furnaces in the nether darkness, that torment the defiled soul through long ages with unending fire, are before the poor man’s eyes though he is far off over the length of space, and in the same way the flashing crowns that are the golden prizes of the righteous, though the gulf separate them, are displayed from afar to the souls that are plunged in the prison-house of punishment. So it is that to the dweller in paradise, blessed now, his fearful sores all ended, is revealed the unhappy spirit wailing under the bane of guilt, and they each see the reward of the other’s deserts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_268_a" id="target_note_LCL387_268_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
