uncontrolled discretion of a free will, so that it may will and follow out its own determination, subjecting the spirit to no bondage? When God made thee lord over all his creation and bade the world be the servant of thy commands, when He gave up to thee land and sky and sea and streams and winds, would He grudge and refuse to entrust thee with control over thyself because He deemed thee unworthy of it, and deny thee freedom? What sort of honour had it been to have been chosen ruler of the great world but not ruler of oneself, bearing the slur of a privilege that was abridged? For what is the honour of a lord whose mind is not free, but whose will obeys a law imposed on it, and cannot vary? And what credit or merit belongs to man in living righteously if he has not to make a definite choice between two paths? A man does not become good of his own will if he has not the power in his discretion to will something else and to divert his sentiments into an opposite course. But he who is not good of his own will is not good nor praiseworthy, since no honour comes of uprightness that is forced, and virtue without honour has no worth; and after all it is not virtue unless it spring forth in the act of rejecting the worse and seek the right path because its nature is better. “Go,” says Adam’s very father and maker and creator, “go, O man, who art raised in rank above all by the breath of my mouth, not made subject but possessed of power, ruler of the world, ruler also and judge of thine own purpose, to me only be thou subject of thine own will, so that thy very subjection may be freely made with unfettered judgment. I force thee not nor constrain thee, but I counsel thee to shun unrighteousness and follow after righteous­ness.
