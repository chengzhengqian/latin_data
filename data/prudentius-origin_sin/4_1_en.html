supremacy and abridges it by subjection to one or other of two sovereignties? Either there is one God to whom belongs supreme power over the world, or else the two powers that exist are each diminished because there is a different supremacy. There is indeed no supremacy but what is one and possessed of plenary power, for separate beings each claiming his own sovereignty and rejecting control have neither supreme nor complete power. Dispersed authority is not plenary, because the one does not have what the other has; the separation takes away from the full measure. But we bear witness to a God who is perfect, undivided, and one, in whom is Christ, He, too, perfect and one, who lives, and has lived beyond all things, and shall live, admitting no partner on terms agreed. The Father is sovereign, Lord of all things, the high source of powers, the one fountain-head of the world, the starting point of all being, author of all birth and beginning. From Him flow all things, both light and times and years and number; it is He who appointed that after one thing there should be a second; for the one is the beginning of number, and one by himself cannot be counted. In this way, since there is no second Father and God, and Christ also is not next after the Father, the one, to whom belongs the one and only Son, is anterior to number. He is God, and rightly God, because first and one, first in his own power, and then first in Him whom He has begotten. For what distinction does mere begetting make? The begetter and the one begotten of one before the primeval darkness, without number or time, will always be one being. Who would venture to say that that which reigns in one majesty and belongs to itself
