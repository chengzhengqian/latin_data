gleams with light. There you have clearly three things together, light and warmth and movement, yet it is one and the same heavenly orb that performs them without separation, it is in one course that it discharges all these functions, and one common substance underlies all three. I would not venture to compare anything with God as though it were on a par with Him, nor to match with the Lord a star that is his servant; but the Father himself has willed that men infer his greatness from what is but small, since they cannot see the things on high. In the mirror of the small we mark things we do not understand, and we are permitted to seek the hidden truth by means of what is at hand. No man has seen two suns, unless his vision were obscured, or when a dusky mantle has overcast the clear sky and a cloud, blocking the path of the shafts of light and reflecting their fire, spreads them into the shape of false orbs. Minds, too, have their clouds and thick atmosphere; there is a cataract that veils the mindâ€™s eye with a watery film and prevents the thought from freely penetrating the translucent heavens and comprehending the one God with quick perception. The earnest gaze is unsound and spreads into double vision, and so builds two altars for two creators. If there are two Gods, why then not many thousands? Why is Deity content with the number two? Had it not been better to scatter abroad whole swarms of divinities over the nations and to fill the wide world everywhere indiscriminately with the monstrous demigods in whose worship wild savages waste their sacrifices? If different Gods hold a divided heaven, then it is natural to assign to clouds and springs and the sounding ocean, to woods and hills
