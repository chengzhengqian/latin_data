<p class="noindent">The scene represents a street in Athens. On it are two houses:
to the left is the house of Toxilus and his absent master, to the
right the house of Dordalus. There is a little alley between the
houses. To the left the main street leads to the harbor, to the
right to the city center.</p>

Among other things, he killed the Nemean Lion and the Lernaean Hydra (a snakelike monster) and caught the Ceryneian Hind. He also captured the Erymanthian Boar, but not the Aetolian (Calydonian) Boar, as Plautus alleges. The killing of the Stymphalian Birds is a canonical part of the twelve labors, while the fight against Antaeus, though done by Hercules, is not one of them.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL163_453_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
