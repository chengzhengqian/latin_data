<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sag</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">(<span class="italic">to Dordalus</span>) Do you want to buy her for a good price?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">dor</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">And you, do you want to sell her for a fine figure?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">tox</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I know that each of you is keen.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sag</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I’ll tell you in advance: no one will convey her to you formally.
Do you know that already?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">dor</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I do. Tell me the lowest price for which you’re going to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">590</span><span class="br"></span>
give her to me, for which she can be had.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">tox</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Be quiet, be quiet. You’re terribly stupid, in a childish
way.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">dor</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">What do you mean?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">tox</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Because I want you first to ask the girl all the important
questions.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">dor</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">That’s good advice. Just look, I, that clever pimp, almost
fell into a pit, if you hadn’t been present. How important<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">595</span><span class="br"></span>
it is to consult a friend when you’re doing business!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">tox</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I want you to ask in what family, in what country, and to
what parents she was born, so that you won’t say you
bought her rashly because I urged or enticed you to.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">dor</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Yes, I praise your plan, I tell you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">tox</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">(<span class="italic">to Sagaristio</span>) Unless it’s a nuisance, he wants to question
the woman briefly.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sag</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Absolutely, at his own discretion.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">600</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">tox</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">(<span class="italic">to Dordalus</span>) Why are you standing around? Do go to him in person and ask him yourself in the same way to be
allowed to ask her what you want; to be sure, he told me
he’d allow you to ask her, but I still prefer you to approach
him in person so that he won’t look down on you.</p></div>
