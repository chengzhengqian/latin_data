<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">tox</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Thank you. Hurry up, go home. Instruct your daughter
cleverly, teach her smartly what story she should tell:
where she should say she was born, who her parents<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">150</span><span class="br"></span>
were, what country she was abducted from. But she
should say she was born far away from Athens; and she
should accompany her words with tears.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sat</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Won’t you be quiet? She’s three times worse on her own
than you want her to be.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">tox</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I’m delighted to hear it. But do you know what you
should do? Take a tunic and a belt, and bring a travel<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">155</span><span class="br"></span>
cloak and a hat which the man who sells her to the pimp
should have—</p></div>
