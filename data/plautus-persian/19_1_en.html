servedly, because they give my friend this supply of success<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">255</span><span class="br"></span>
in a friendly way, namely that I can bring him plenty
of money on loan when he’s in need. What I didn’t dream
of, think of, or believe in, that I would have this opportunity,
this has now, as it were, fallen down from heaven:
my master has sent me to Eretria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL163_487_22" id="target_note_LCL163_487_22"><sup>22</sup></a> to purchase plow oxen
for him; he gave me the money, because he said there<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">260</span><span class="br"></span>
would be a market there a week from now. It was stupid
of him to give me this money since he knew my ways;
I’ll use this money up elsewhere: “There were no oxen
for me to buy.” Now I’ll support my friend and do myself
many good turns. In a single day I’ll use up what
will make me happy for a long time. It’ll be swish-swash
for my back. I don’t care. Now I’ll present my friend<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">265</span><span class="br"></span>
with these plow animals from my wallet: this is lovely
indeed, to fleece overstingy, elderly, greedy, tightfisted
men properly, who seal up the salt in the saltcellar to stop
the slaves getting it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL163_487_23" id="target_note_LCL163_487_23"><sup>23</sup></a> It’s a virtue to see clearly when the
occasion reminds you to. What will he do to me? He’ll
have me beaten with blows and have shackles put onto
me. Let him get a beating, so he won’t believe I’m going<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">270</span><span class="br"></span>
to entreat him: bad luck to him! He can’t bring me anything
new any longer, anything I haven’t experienced.
But who is coming out from here? Look, it’s Paegnium,
Toxilus’ slave boy.</p><span class="stage"><span class="italic">Enter PAEGNIUM from the pimp’s house, running past
