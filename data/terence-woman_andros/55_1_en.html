</span> He’s like this, Crito. Ignore it.</p></div>

</span> He’d better look to his behaviour. If he insists on saying
what he likes, he’ll hear what he doesn’t like. (<span class="italic">to Simo</span>)
Did I cause this situation? Is it any concern to me? It’s
your problem: can’t you handle it without losing your
temper? As for my story, you can soon check whether
what I’ve heard is true or false. Some time ago an Athenian
was shipwrecked on the coast of Andros. He had a
small girl with him. He’d lost everything, and quite by
chance the first person he turned to was Chrysis’ father.</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cri</span>

</span> The man who took him in was a relative of mine. I was
there and I heard him say that he was an Athenian citizen.
He died on Andros.</p></div>

<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> His name?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cri</span>
</span> His name? Just a moment. Was it Phania? (<span class="italic">trying to remember</span>)
Oh damn it! (<span class="italic">after a pause</span>) Yes, by god, I think
it was Phania. One thing I’m quite sure about: he said he
came from Rhamnus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_159_49" id="target_note_LCL022_159_49">
