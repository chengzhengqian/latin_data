</span> Hey, did you work it out for yourself that this was a
pretence?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) I’m being mocked.</p></div>

</span> Somebody told you. How else did you come to suspect?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> How? Because I know you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> You’re as good as saying it was all my plan.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> I’m quite sure it was.</p></div>

</span> If I ever try to tell you something, you immediately suppose
that I’m deceiving you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> And wrongly?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> The result is that now I daren’t utter a word, for god’s
sake.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> The one thing I do know is that nobody has had a baby
here.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> You realised! Even so, any moment they’ll bring a baby
out and put it on the doorstep. I’m telling you this will
happen now, master, so that you’ll be warned and you
can’t afterwards say that it was all some plot or trick of
Davus’. I want to dispel your prejudice against me once
and for all.</p></div>
