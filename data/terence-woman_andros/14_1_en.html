and allowed me to do whatever took my fancy. Oppose
him now? Oh dear! I just don’t know what to do.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Poor me, I dread to think where that “don’t know”
is leading. But now it’s imperative that either he speaks
with her or I say something to him about her. When a
man’s wavering, a little thing can influence him one way
or the other.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">finally aware that there is someone present</span>) Who’s that

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Well may you ask! The poor girl’s in pain from her labour,
and she’s anxious because your marriage was originally
fixed for today. On top of that, she’s worried that you are
going to abandon her.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> What! Could I even think of doing that? Let the poor girl
be betrayed on my account when she has trusted me with
her heart and her whole life, when I have held her so very
dear and treated her as my wife? Let a nature formed and
fashioned in purity and innocence be corrupted by the
demands of poverty? I won’t do it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">mys</span>
</span> I wouldn’t be afraid if it depended solely on you, but you
may be forced against your will.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> Do you think me so base or ungrateful or inhuman or unfeeling,
that neither our intimacy nor love nor my sense
of honour could stir my heart or impel me to keep my
word?</p></div><notes></notes></section>
