The lyric is here intended to heighten the emotional effect. It may be
part of the characterisation of Charinus that the ideas expressed are
both trite and muddled.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_121_38').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
