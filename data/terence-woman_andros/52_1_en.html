Come out here, Pamphilus! Aren’t you ashamed
of yourself?</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">angrily</span>) What have you to say for yourself, you worst of

</span> As if it were possible to speak too harshly to him! (<span class="italic">to
Pamphilus</span>) Well, are you saying Glycerium is a citizen?</p></div>

</span> So they claim.</p></div>

<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> “So they claim?” What monstrous insolence! Does he
think what he’s saying? Does he regret what he’s done?
See if there’s a blush on his face which might indicate
shame. How can he be so headstrong as to defy social
custom and the law and the wishes of his own father?
He’s determined to have this woman whatever the disgrace.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> I’m a miserable wretch!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> What! Have you only now realised that, Pamphilus?
Long long ago, when you decided that you must get what
you wanted by whatever means you could, that was the
day when you really earned that description. But why do
I bother? Why torture myself? Why torment myself?
Why worry my old age with his folly? Just so that I can
suffer the punishment for his misdeeds? No, let him have
her, let him live with her, and good riddance!</p></div>
