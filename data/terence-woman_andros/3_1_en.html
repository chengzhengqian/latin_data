</span> I’m delighted if anything I’ve done, or do, pleases you,
Simo, and I’m grateful that my behaviour has found your
favour. But now you disturb me. Your reminder sounds
like a reproach for ingratitude. Why don’t you tell me in a
word what you want me to do?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> I will. The first thing I want you to know about the situation
is this. The wedding which you believe is taking
place is not a real one.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> I’ll tell you the whole story from the beginning. That

</a> and had the opportunity to
live with greater freedom—for how could you know him
or judge his character before, while he was restrained by
age and apprehension and a tutor?—</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sos</span>
</span> Quite so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> —he behaved as all young lads tend to do, involving
themselves in some pursuit like breeding horses or
hounds or studying philosophy. However, he didn’t pursue
any one of these things in particular but all of them in
moderation. I was delighted.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sos</span>
</span> And rightly so. I believe that the best principle in life is
nothing in excess.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_55_10" id="target_note_LCL022_55_10">
