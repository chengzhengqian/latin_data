Chremes enters from the audience’s right, his house being located in the direction of the forum (line 361). Davus also reenters from the audience’s right, pretending to have come from the forum (line 745). When Davus tells Mysis that he too will enter “from the right” (line 734), he must therefore mean the audience’s right, which is possible only if he has his back to the audience at the time (he is facing Mysis, who is laying the baby on the doorstep), so that actors’ right and audi- ence’s right coincide. However, Davus must exit to the audience’s left,
to avoid meeting Chremes on the latter’s approach, so we have to assume
that he runs round behind the stage building in order to return
from the audience’s right. In line 751 Davus draws Mysis aside “to the
right,” which could now be actors’ right, depending on where we assume
Chremes to be now standing.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_135_42a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
