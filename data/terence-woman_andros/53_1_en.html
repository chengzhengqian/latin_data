</span> How do you mean “Father”? You don’t need me for a
father. You’ve found your own home, wife, and children
against your father’s wishes. You’ve brought in people to
declare that she’s an Athenian citizen. Enjoy your victory.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Father, may I speak briefly?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> There’s nothing you can say.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Even so, listen, Simo.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> Listen? Listen to what, Chremes?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> But let him speak.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> All right, let him speak. I give my permission.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> I confess that I love her. If that is a sin, I confess that too.
I put myself in your hands, father. Impose whatever burden
you wish. Give me my orders. Do you wish me to take
a wife? Do you wish me to send <span class="italic">her</span> away? I will bear it as
best I can. But I make this one entreaty: don’t believe
that I brought in this old gentleman. Let me clear myself;
let me bring him here to meet you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> Bring him here?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> Let me, father.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> It’s a fair request. Grant it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> Let me persuade you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> I give my permission. (<span class="italic">to Chremes, as Pamphilus goes
into Glycerium’s house to get Crito</span>) I’d give anything
rather than find out that he’s deceiving me, Chremes.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> However great the misdeed, a father should be content
with a small punishment.</p></div>
<span class="stage">
<span class="italic">Enter <span class="sc">pamphilus</span> and <span class="sc">crito</span> from Glycerium’s house.</span>
</span>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cri</span>
</span> You don’t have to beg me. I’ll do it for any one of three</p></div><notes></notes></section>
