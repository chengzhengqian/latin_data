</span> I’m a free man today, Davus, thanks to you.</p></div>

</span> How so? He’s quite obviously not giving her to <span class="italic">him</span> (<span class="italic">indicating
Pamphilus</span>).</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> Don’t be ridiculous. As if it followed that, if he doesn’t
give her to him, she’ll marry <span class="italic">you,</span> unless you look sharp
and canvas the old man’s friends for support.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> Good advice. I’ll go, though, god knows, my hopes have
often been dashed before. Goodbye. (<span class="italic">he exits right in the
direction of the forum, leaving Pamphilus and Davus onstage</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> So what’s my father up to? Why this pretence?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> I’ll tell you. If he flew into a rage now at Chremes’ refusal
to give you his daughter, before having established <span class="italic">your</span>
attitude towards the wedding, he would feel that he was
putting himself in the wrong, and rightly so. But if you refuse
to marry her, he’ll transfer the blame on to you. And
then there’ll be trouble.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> I’ll put up with anything.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> He’s your father, Pamphilus; it’s difficult. Besides, Glycerium
has no one to protect her. He’ll find a pretext for
driving her out of town, no sooner said than done.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> Driving her out?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
