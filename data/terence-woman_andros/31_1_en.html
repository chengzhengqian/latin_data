</span> A number of people have come up to me to say that
they’ve heard from you that my daughter is marrying
your son today. I’ve come to see whether it is you who
have taken leave of your senses or they.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> Just listen a moment, and I’ll tell you what I want and
answer your question.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> I’m listening. Say what you want.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">earnestly</span>) I beg you in the name of the gods, Chremes,
and of our friendship, which began when we were young
and has grown stronger with age, and in the name of your
only daughter and my son, whose salvation rests entirely
in your hands, to support me in this matter and allow the
wedding to take place as planned.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Ah! Please don’t beseech me. This isn’t a favour to be
gained by begging. Do you think I’m a different man
from before when I offered my daughter? If it is in both
their interests that the wedding takes place, have her
fetched.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_111_34" id="target_note_LCL022_111_34">
<sup>34</sup>
</a> But if it is going to cause them both more harm
than good, I beg you to look to our common interest, as if
she were your daughter and Pamphilus my son.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> You misunderstand me, Chremes. Those are my wishes;
that’s what I’m asking to happen. And I wouldn’t ask it of
you if the circumstances weren’t favourable.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> How do you mean?</p></div>
