</span> As if you didn’t know! There’s a rumour that my son’s in
love.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">ironically</span>) It’s a matter of public interest, obviously.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> Are you taking me seriously or not?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Yes, I am.</p></div>

</span> Well, I would be a harsh father to pursue that now. What
my son did in the past is not my concern. While the time
was appropriate for such things, I allowed him to satisfy
his desires. But today brings another life, demands another
way of behaving. From now on I expect you or, if I
may properly do so, I implore you, Davus, to bring him
back to the right path. Let me explain. All lovers resent
being given a wife.</p></div>
