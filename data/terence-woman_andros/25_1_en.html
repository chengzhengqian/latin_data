</span> Nothing? Really!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> Nothing at all.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Well, I was expecting something.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) It’s taken him by surprise, I can see that. He’s not
enjoying this.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> Can you tell me the truth?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> Nothing easier.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Isn’t he a little bit annoyed at this wedding in view of his
affair with the foreign woman?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> God, no. Or, if he is, he’ll only be upset for a day or two,
you know, and then he’ll get over it. He’s been thinking it
over himself in his own mind, and he’s on the right path.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> Good for him.</p></div>

</span> While the licence of youth permitted it, he had a love affair.
Even then he kept it quiet, taking care that it should
never bring him into disrepute, as an honest man should.
Now it’s time for a wife, and he has directed his thoughts
towards a wife.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> He seemed a little bit subdued to me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> But not on this account. There’s something else which is
upsetting him.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> Whatever is it?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">with feigned reluctance</span>) It’s childish.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
