</span> My mistress told me to beg you to come and see her
straightaway, if you love her. She says she’s longing to see
you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Oh, damn it! Here we go again! (to Davus) To
think that she and I are tortured with worries because of
your meddling! She’s sending for me because she’s heard
about the wedding preparations.</p></div>

</span> How easily things could have been kept quiet, (<span class="italic">pointing
to Davus</span>) if he had kept quiet!</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to Charinus</span>) Go on, goad him on, as if he isn’t out of his
mind on his own account.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to Pamphilus</span>) That’s just it, for god’s sake, and that’s why
the poor girl’s pining away.</p></div>

<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">solemnly</span>) Mysis, I swear to you by all the gods that I will
never abandon her, not if it means I must have all the
world as my enemies. I courted her, I won her, we suit
each other. Good riddance to those who want to separate
us! Nothing but death will take her from me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Apollo’s oracle does not speak more truly. If it’s possible
to convince my father that it’s not my fault that the wedding’s
called off, that’s what I wish. But if it’s not possible,
I’ll do the easy thing, and let him believe that it <span class="italic">is</span> my
fault. (to Charinus) How am I doing?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Miserably, the same as me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Pamphilus</span>) I’m searching for a plan.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">sarcastically</span>) Well done! I know your efforts.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> I’ll carry this one through, I promise you.</p></div>

</span> I need it now.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
