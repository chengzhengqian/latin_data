</span> (<span class="italic">with a hint of impatience</span>) I’ll tell you what’s true, by god:
lovers’ quarrels are love’s renewal.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Well then, I beg you, let’s prevent that happening. While
the opportunity offers, while his desires are disrupted
by their quarrels, before those women’s wicked ways
and cunningly contrived tears can work on his lovesick
mind and reduce him to pity, let’s give him a wife. I expect
that, once he is tied down by a respectable marriage,
Chremes, he will easily extricate himself from the other
situation.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> That’s what you think. I don’t believe he can. But he can’t
keep that woman for ever, nor can I put up with it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> So how do you know, if you don’t take the risk?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> It’s a serious business to risk your daughter.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> After all, the worst thing that it could come to in the end
is a separation, which heaven forbid! But if he mends his
ways, consider all the advantages. In the first place, you’ll
have given a friend back his son, and you’ll gain a steady
son-in-law for yourself and husband for your daughter.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">reluctantly</span>) All right, then. If you are convinced that this
is in everybody’s interests, I don’t want to stand in your
way.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> You deserve the high regard which I have always had for
you, Chremes.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> But tell me this.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">sim</span>
</span> What?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> How do you know they’re quarrelling?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Davus told me himself; he’s in on all their plans. And he’s
urging me to hasten the wedding with all speed. Do you
suppose he would do that, if he didn’t know that my son
was keen on it? You can hear it from his own mouth.
