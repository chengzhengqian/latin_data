</span> Not so. This is the situation as I see it. Your father will say
“I want you to marry today.” You’ll say “All right.” Tell
me, how can he quarrel with that? This way you’ll throw
all his well-laid plans into confusion and without any
danger to yourself: there’s no doubting that Chremes will
refuse to give you his daughter. But you mustn’t for that
reason alter your present behaviour or he may change his
mind. Tell your father you’re willing, so that he can’t
rightly be angry with you whenever he chooses. As for
your hope that “With my character I’ll easily avoid marriage;
nobody will give me a wife,” he’ll find you a poor
one rather than see you go to the bad. On the other
hand, if he hears you’re taking this calmly, he won’t worry
so much. He’ll look for another one at his leisure, and
meanwhile (<span class="italic">vaguely</span>) something will turn up.</p></div>
