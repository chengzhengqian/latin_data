on another day, and I could find nothing which implicated
Pamphilus. I supposed he had come through the
test and proved himself a fine model of self-restraint.
When a man is involved with characters like that and
doesn’t fall to temptation, you can be sure that he is now
capable of taking control over his own life. This was not
only a source of pleasure to me; everyone else with one
accord spoke well of him, and they congratulated me on
my good fortune in having a son endowed with such a
disposition. To cut the story short, Chremes was so
impressed with my son’s reputation that he came to me
of his own accord to offer his only daughter in marriage
with a substantial dowry. I accepted the offer and
arranged the match, and today is the day fixed for the
wedding.</p></div>

</span> I’ll tell you. Within a few days of this arrangement our
neighbour Chrysis died.</p></div>

</span> Good news! I’m a happy man. I was afraid what Chrysis
would do to him.</p></div>

</span> At this point my son was spending all his time with
Chrysis’ lovers, helping them with the funeral. He was
distressed at times and occasionally joined in their weeping.
At the time I was pleased at this. I thought “He’s taking
her death very personally when he barely knew her.
What if he had himself been one of her lovers? What
will he do in my case, his own father?” I supposed his behaviour
was all due to human feeling and a sympathetic
nature. Anyway, I went to the funeral myself for his sake,
still not suspecting that anything was amiss.</p></div>
