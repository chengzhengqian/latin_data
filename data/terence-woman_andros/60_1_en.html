curtainless theatre signifies to the audience the end of the play. In the
MSS this request is preceded by the Greek letter omega, of which the
significance is not at all clear. It is implied by Horace <span class="italic">Ars Poetica</span> 155
(<span class="italic">donec cantor ‘vos plaudite’ dicat</span>) that the final <span class="italic">plaudit</span> was spoken by
the <span class="italic">cantor</span> (perhaps the musician who accompanied the play), but there
is no other evidence to corroborate this. It is more likely that it was
spoken either by all the actors onstage, as in several plays of Plautus’,
signified in the MSS by <span class="italic">grex</span> or <span class="italic">caterva</span>, or by one of the characters (here
presumably Davus), as in the rest of Plautus’ plays.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_169_55').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL022_169_56"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL022_169_56" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">56</sup>A number of the later MSS preserve an alternative ending to the
play in which Pamphilus persuades Chremes to betroth Philumena to
Charinus. This ending was recognised by Donatus and Eugraphius as
not being by Terence: its obvious intention was to create a more satisfactory
outcome for the second pair of lovers.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_169_56').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
