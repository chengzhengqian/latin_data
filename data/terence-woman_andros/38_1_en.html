</span> What’s so surprising if he follows your example?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> You wouldn’t say that if you knew the truth about me and
my love.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">with bitter irony</span>) I see. You’ve been having an argument
with your father all this time, and he’s now furious with
you, having failed to compel you to marry her today.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> On the contrary. You have no idea about my problems.
This marriage was not taking place; nobody was asking
me to take a wife.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">scornfully</span>) I see. You were compelled of your own free
will.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> Hold on. You still don’t know the facts.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> I know one fact: you are about to marry her.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> Why do you try my patience? Listen. He never stopped
pressing me to tell my father I would marry her. He
urged me, begged me, until in the end he persuaded me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> Who did?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> Davus.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> Davus?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> He’s the cause of all this trouble.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> Why?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pam</span>
</span> I’ve no idea, though the gods must have been angry with
me to make me listen.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Davus</span>) Is this true, Davus?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">reluctantly</span>) Yes.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> What! What do you have to say for yourself, you villain?
May the gods destroy you as your deeds deserve! Hey,
tell me, if all his enemies wanted him propelled into a
marriage, could they have conceived a better scheme?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> I made a mistake but I haven’t given up.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> I see.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
