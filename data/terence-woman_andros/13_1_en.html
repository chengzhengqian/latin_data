me to misery? If this happens, I’m utterly lost. To think
that a man can be so unlucky in love, so ill-fated as I am!
In the name of gods and men, is there no way I can escape

out a word? Or produce any argument, even a silly, untrue,
unreasonable one? I was struck dumb. If anyone
now asked me what I would be doing if I’d known about it

avoid doing it. But as it is, what’s my best course of action?
There are so many concerns weighing me down and
pulling my heart in different directions—love, pity for
her, anxiety about this wedding, and on the other side respect</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL022_75_21"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL022_75_21" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">21</sup>According to Donatus the Latin phrase (<span class="italic">facta transacta</span>) was proverbial.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL022_75_21').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
