</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) Well, Davus, there’s no room here for idleness
or procrastination, if I understood the old man’s
intention about the marriage just now. If this business
isn’t managed with some skill, it’ll be the ruin either
of myself or of my master. I can’t decide what to do,
whether to help Pamphilus or obey the old man. If I
abandon Pamphilus, I fear for his life; if I assist him, I’ve
the old man’s threats to fear, and he’s a difficult man to
deceive. For a start he’s already found out about the love
affair: he’s watching me like an enemy in case I play some
trick over the wedding. If he catches me, I’m lost; in any
case, if the fancy takes him, he’ll find a reason for despatching
me headlong to the mill, whether I deserve it
or not.</p><p class="lineGroup">On top of all this there’s a further problem. The
Andrian woman, whether she’s a wife or a mistress, is
pregnant by Pamphilus. And you should just listen to
their impudence. They’re scheming like lunatics rather
than lovers. They have decided to raise the baby, whatever
it is.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL022_71_19a" id="target_note_LCL022_71_19a">

</a> And they’re now concocting a story between
them that the woman is an Athenian citizen. “Once upon
a time there was an elderly merchant. He was shipwrecked
off the island of Andros and died. The girl was
washed ashore and Chrysis’ father took the little orphan
in.” What nonsense! It seems pretty improbable to me,
but they’re pleased with their fiction. But here comes
Mysis from the house. I’ll be off to the forum to find
Pamphilus, in case his father catches him off guard with
the news. (<span class="italic">he exits right in the direction of the forum</span>)</p></div>

Female and illegitimate babies were particularly at risk. The decision appears to have lain with the
father, who could choose whether or not to acknowledge the baby by
picking it up; this is the technical sense of the word “raise” here (Latin
