</span> What are you saying, Byrria? She’s being married to Pamphilus
today?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">byr</span>
</span> That’s right.</p></div>

</span> How do you know?</p></div>

</span> I heard it from Davus in the forum just now.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> Oh damn and blast! Up to now my mind has been racked
with hope and fear; now all hope is gone, it’s sick to death
with worry and numbed with exhaustion.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">byr</span>
</span> Please, Charinus, for god’s sake, since you can’t have
what you want, want what you can have.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> The only thing I want is Philumena.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">byr</span>
</span> Oh! How much better to set about banishing that love
from your heart than to say things which only inflame
your desire to no purpose!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> We can all readily give good advice to the sick when we’re
well. If you were in my place, you would feel differently.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">byr</span>
</span> All right, all right, as you like.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">finally catching sight of Pamphilus, who is standing
aside immersed in his problems</span>) But there’s Pamphilus.
I’m determined to try everything possible before I’m
lost.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">byr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) What’s he going to do?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cha</span>
</span> I’ll plead with him, I’ll go down on my knees, I’ll tell him
of my love. I’m sure I can persuade him at least to postpone
his wedding for a few days. Meanwhile something
will turn up, I hope.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
