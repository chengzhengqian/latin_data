</span> Forgotten? Oh Mysis, Mysis, even now Chrysis’ words
about Glycerium are engraved on my heart. She summoned
me on her death bed, and I went to her. You were
all sent away, and we were alone. “My dear Pamphilus,”
she said “you see her youth and beauty, and you are well
aware that both of these are now useless to protect her
honour or her property. By this right hand of yours and
by your own better self, by your good faith and her lonely
state, I beseech you not to turn your back on her or abandon
her. If I have cherished you like my own brother, if
she has always honoured you above all others, if she has
obeyed you in everything, I give you to her to be her husband,
friend, protector, father. I entrust these possessions
of ours to you; I commit them to your good faith.”
She put Glycerium into my hands, and at that moment
death overcame her. I accepted the charge, and, having
accepted it, I will not let her down.</p></div>

</span> Hurry. And listen. Not a word about the wedding, in case
on top of her pains—</p></div>
