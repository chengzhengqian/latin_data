</span> (<span class="italic">with feigned indignation</span>) Who was it but me who
dragged him away from her? We all know how desperately
he was in love with her; now he wants to take a wife.
In short, let me look after this. Meanwhile you go on with
the wedding as you’re doing, and I hope the gods will give
us their blessing.</p></div>

</span> No, you go inside. Wait for me there, and prepare everything
we need. (<span class="italic">Davus exits into Simo’s house</span>) (<span class="italic">to himself</span>)
He hasn’t altogether convinced me; yet, for all I
know, everything he says may be true. But I don’t care
very much. By far the most important thing to me is the
promise my son gave me. I’ll go and find Chremes now
and ask for his daughter in marriage. If he agrees, what
better day for the wedding than today? If my son tries to
go back on his promise, there’s no doubt I’ll have every
right to compel him. But here comes Chremes, just at the
right moment.</p></div>
