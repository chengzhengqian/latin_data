</span> Don’t ask. Evil mind, evil heart. Indeed, if I find him—But why waste words? If things turn out as I wish and
Pamphilus offers no resistance, I’ve only Chremes to
persuade, and I’m confident that can be done. Now, it’s
your job to maintain the pretence of the marriage, scare
Davus off, and keep an eye on my son’s doings and on any
plan the two of them conceive.</p></div>

</span> All right. I’ll see to it.</p></div>

</span> Let’s go in now. You go first, I’ll follow. (<span class="italic">Sosia exits into
Simo’s house</span>) There’s no doubt that my son will refuse
the marriage. I noticed Davus was worried just now
when he heard that the wedding was going to take place.
But he’s coming out.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) I was surprised if it could end this way. The
master was so calm, and I’ve been afraid all the time
where that was leading. Ever since he heard that his son’s
wedding was cancelled, he hasn’t said a word to any of us
or been at all upset.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Well, he will now, and, if you ask me, it means a
thrashing for you.</p></div>

</span> He meant to lead us on with false rejoicing, unsuspecting,
full of hope, freed from fear, and then to catch us
napping, giving us no time to think up a plan to prevent
the marriage. The cunning old blighter!</p></div><notes></notes></section>
