In the case of Pius, for instance, Antoninus was his actual name and Pius only a surname. Moreover, the true name of Marcus was Verissimus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_95_2" id="target_note_LCL140_95_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but when this was set aside and annulled, Antoninus was conferred on him not as a praenomen but as his name. So the original name of Verus was Commodus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_95_3" id="target_note_LCL140_95_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but when this was annulled, he too was called Antoninus not as a praenomen but as a name. Commodus, however, was given the name Antoninus by Marcus, and on the day of his birth he was so enrolled in the public records. As for Caracalla Bassianus, it is well known that he was called Antoninus on account of a dream beheld by Severus, which revealed that an Antoninus was fore-ordained to be his successor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_95_4" id="target_note_LCL140_95_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and that he was given the name in his thirteenth year, when, it is said, Severus conferred on him also the imperial power. Geta, moreover, who, many aver, was not called Antoninus at all, was given the name, it is generally said, with the same intention as Bassianusâ€”namely that he might succeed his father Severus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_95_5" id="target_note_LCL140_95_5"><sup>5</sup></a>; but this never came to pass. After him, the name Antoninus was given to this very Diadumenianus, in order, it is generally said, that he might thereby find favour with the army, the senate, and the people of Rome, since there was a great yearning for Bassianus Caracalla.</p>
