But before I insert this letter, I wish to include some verses directed at Commodus, who had taken the name of Hercules,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_97_1" id="target_note_LCL140_97_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in order that I may show to all that the name of the Antonines was so illustrious that it was not deemed suitable to add to it even the name of a god. The verses directed against Commodus Antoninus are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Commodus wished to possess Hercules’ name as his</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">own;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That of the great Antonines did not seem noble</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">enough.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nothing of common law, nothing of ruling he knew,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Hoping indeed as a god greater renown to acquire</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Than by remaining a prince called by an excellent</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">name.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Neither a god will he be, nor for that matter a man.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>These verses, written by an unknown Greek, some unskilful poet has rendered into Latin, and I have thought it right to insert them here for the purpose of showing to all that the Antonines were deemed greater than the gods as a result of the love felt for the three emperors, a love which has enshrined their wisdom, kindness, and righteousness—righteousness in the case of Pius, kindness in the case of Verus, and wisdom in the case of Marcus. I will now return to the letter written by Opellius Macrinus:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL140_97_2" id="target_note_LCL140_97_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>“Opellius Macrinus to his wife Nonia Celsa. The good fortune to which we have attained, my dear wife, is incalculable. Perhaps you may think I allude to the imperial power, but this is nothing
