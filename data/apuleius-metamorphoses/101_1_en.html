Apollo, although a Greek and an Ionic Greek at that, answered with an oracle in Latin to show favour to the author of this Milesian tale.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL044_203_26" id="target_note_LCL044_203_26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

Now the light of the wedding torch grew dim with black, sooty ashes. Now the tune of the conjugal flute changed into the plaintive Lydian mode and the happy song of the marriage-hymn ended in a mournful wail. The bride-to-be was wiping tears away with her own flame-red bridal veil. The whole city joined in grief over the harsh fate of the afflicted house, and business was at once suspended as an appropriate show of public mourning.</p>
