below, in the middle of a faintly lighted grove, she caught sight of an artfully constructed shrine. Unwilling to omit any possible path, however doubtful, toward improved hopes, and willing to seek favour from any divinity, she approached the consecrated doors. She saw costly offerings and ribbons lettered in gold attached to the tree-branches and doorposts, which bore witness to the name of the goddess to whom they had been dedicated, along with thanks for her deed. Psyche knelt and embraced in her arms the altar still warm with sacrifice, dried her tears, and then prayed.</p>

Samos is an island in the eastern Aegean. At Carthage, the Romans assimilated the Punic goddess Tanit, calling her Juno Caelestis. Argos was a city-state in the Peloponnese; its personified  river Inachus was the father of Io, whom Jupiter raped and Juno mercilessly persecuted.
