I guarded my haunches as much as possible against
the beasts’ attacks by hiding concealed in the middle of
the crowd of closely packed animals; and now everyone
was amazed at how I surpassed all the other horses with
my swift gait. That velocity, however, was not a sign of
eagerness on my part, but of cowardice. Then it was that
the thought occurred to me that the famed Pegasus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_75_10" id="target_note_LCL453_75_10"><sup>10</sup></a> had
