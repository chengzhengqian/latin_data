gift to his master, our host, a rich, fat thigh from an enormous
stag. This had been carelessly hung near the kitchen
door not very high off the ground, and a dog—likewise a
hunter—had stealthily snatched it and, delighted with his
catch, had quickly evaded all guardian eyes. When the
cook discovered the loss, he blamed his own negligence
and shed many a useless tear. As his master was already demanding
his dinner, the cook was plunged into dejection
and total terror. He bade farewell to his little son, and took
a rope and tied it into a noose in preparation for suicide.
His faithful wife, however, aware of her husband’s fatal
plight, violently seized the deadly noose in both hands.
“Are you so frightened,” she said, “by your present trouble
that you have lost your mind? Don’t you see the fortuitous
remedy which divine Providence has provided? If you can
see reason at all in the midst of this terrible tempest of Fortune,
wake up and listen to me. Do you see that ass who
just arrived? Take him to some out-of-the-way spot and slit
his throat, cut off his thigh to look like the one you lost,
cook it up elaborately with a highly seasoned sauce, and
serve it to the master in place of the venison.”</p>

by my death. With much praise of his fellow-slave’s intelligence,
he began to sharpen his knives for the proposed
butchery.</p>
