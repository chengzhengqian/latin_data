a safe harbour for ships and has a large population. I
avoided the crowds, therefore, and chose a hidden stretch
of shore. There, right next to the spray from the breakers, I
stretched out in a soft hollow of sand to refresh my weary
body, for the Sun’s chariot had raced round the last turningpost

quiet, sweet sleep overwhelmed me.</p>
