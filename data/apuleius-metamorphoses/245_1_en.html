Emperor, while the man denied it and kept calling on the
gods as his witnesses. When I heard the noisy uproar of
their argument—being by nature an inquisitive ass endowed
with restless impulsiveness—I wriggled my neck
out through a little window and tried to see what in the
world all the noise meant. Just then one of the soldiers
happened by pure chance to look round and catch sight of
my shadow. He called all the others to look and instantly a
great clamour arose. Some of them ran upstairs, seized me,
and dragged me down like a prisoner. With all doubt now
removed, they examined every part of the house more
thoroughly than before. This time they opened the chest.
There they discovered the poor gardener, brought him
out, handed him over to the magistrates, and took him off
to the public gaol, no doubt for execution. Meanwhile they
kept up a steady stream of loud laughter and jests about my
peeping. And this is the origin of the proverb about the
peeping ass and his shadow.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_173_15" id="target_note_LCL453_173_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

or insignificant matters.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL453_173_15').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
