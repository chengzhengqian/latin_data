had nearly collapsed from pallor and filth, by bathing and
then by eating. Dutiful as she always was to her parents,
she succumbed reluctantly to the force of moral obligation
and fulfilled the duties of the living as she was bidden, not
indeed with a cheerful countenance, but with a somewhat
calmer one. Actually in her heart, or rather deep in her
marrow, she kept tormenting her soul with mourning and
grief. She spent all her time, day and night, in mournful
longing. She had statues of the deceased moulded with the
attributes of the god Dionysus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_61_6" id="target_note_LCL453_61_6"><sup>6</sup></a> and forcing slavery on herself
she worshipped them with religious rites, torturing
herself with the very thing that consoled her.</p>

tears and the fury of her agitated mind had subsided and
her mourning had feebly collapsed in exhaustion from its

to her, and in careless thoughtlessness revealed
the unspoken secrets of his heart and his ineffable guile.
Charite shuddered in abomination at his unspeakable
words; as if she had been struck by a massive thunderclap
or sun-stroke or Jove’s own lightning bolt, her body
collapsed and her mind clouded over. After a time she
gradually recovered her breath and began to utter animal-like
moans. Now that she clearly saw through the evil
Thrasyllus’ act, in order to sharpen her plans she asked her
suitor to postpone his desire. During this delay the ghost of
the pitiably slaughtered Tlepolemus broke in upon his
wife’s chaste sleep, revealing itself in a form all covered
with blood and gore, misshapen and pale.</p>
