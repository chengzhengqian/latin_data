my dream. Nor did confirmation fail to appear, for I instantly
caught sight of one of the <span class="italic">pastophori</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_289_39" id="target_note_LCL453_289_39"><sup>39</sup></a> who, besides
the evidence of his foot, precisely fitted my dream apparition
in physical appearance and dress. I learned later that
he was called Asinius Marcellus, a name not at all inappropriate
