I deal in honey and cheese and that sort of innkeepers’ merchandise, travelling back and forth through Thessaly, Aetolia, and Boeotia. So when I learned that at Hypata, which is the most important city in all Thessaly,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL044_11_12" id="target_note_LCL044_11_12"><sup>12</sup></a> some fresh fine-flavoured cheese was being sold at a quite advantageous price, I rushed there in a hurry to buy it all up. But, as usually happens, I started out with my left foot and my hope of profit was frustrated, because a wholesale merchant named Lupus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL044_11_13" id="target_note_LCL044_11_13"><sup>13</sup></a> had purchased it all the day before. Therefore, exhausted as a result of my inefficacious haste, I begin to walk toward the baths just as the evening-star was rising.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span><p>“Suddenly I caught sight of Socrates,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL044_11_14" id="target_note_LCL044_11_14"><sup>14</sup></a> an old friend of mine. He was sitting on the ground, half covered by a tattered old cloak, almost unrecognisable in his sallowness, pitiably deformed and shrunken, like those cast-offs of Fortune who are forever begging alms at street corners. Seeing him in such a state, even though he was a very close friend whom I knew well, I approached him with some doubts in my mind.</p>
<p>“‘Oh Socrates, my friend,’ I said, ‘what has happened to you? How terrible you look! What a disgrace! At your home you have already been lamented and ritually addressed as dead, guardians have been appointed for your children by decree of the provincial judge, and your wife, after performing all the funeral services, disfiguring herself with long mourning and grief, and nearly weeping her eyes into uselessness, is being pressed by her parents to gladden the family’s misfortune with the joys of a new marriage. And you show up here, the image of a ghost, to our utter shame!’</p>
