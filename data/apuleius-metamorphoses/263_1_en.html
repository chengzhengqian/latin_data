me. She took no remedy for her insane passion but, like
some asinine Pasiphae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_209_11" id="target_note_LCL453_209_11"><sup>11</sup></a> ardently yearned for my embraces.
She therefore bargained with my keeper, offering
him a large price to lie with me for one night; and he
agreed, not the least concerned whether anything pleasant
could result for me, but content only with his own gain.</p>

room when we met the lady, who had already been waiting
for a long time in my room. Good gods, what luxurious and
splendid fittings! Four eunuchs were hastily making a bed
for us on the ground out of a large number of pillows airily
puffed out with soft feathers. Over these they carefully laid
covers coloured with gold cloth and Tyrian purple, and on
top they scattered some other pillows, small but quite numerous,
the kind that refined women use to support their
chins and necks. They did not delay their mistress’s pleasure
by their continued presence, but closed the bedroom
door and went away. Inside wax candles sparkled with brilliant
light and whitened the night’s darkness for us.</p>

the band with which she had bound her lovely breasts.
Standing next to the light, she anointed herself all over
with oil of balsam from a pewter jar, and lavishly rubbed
me down with the same, but with much greater eagerness.
She even moistened my nostrils with frankincense. Then
she kissed me intimately—not the sort of kisses tossed
about in a whorehouse, the money-begging kisses of prostitutes
