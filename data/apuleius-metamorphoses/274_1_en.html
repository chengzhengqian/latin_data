delightfully took her position at the very centre of
the stage, smiling sweetly and surrounded by a whole mob
of happy little boys. You would have said that those soft,
round, milky-skinned babies were real Cupids who had
just flown in from the sky or the sea. With their little wings
and tiny arrows and all the rest of their costume they fitted
the part splendidly, and they lit the way for their mistress
with twinkling torches as if she were on her way to her
wedding feast. Then in streamed handsome groups of unwed
girls, on one side the graceful Graces, on the other the
lovely Hours, worshipping their goddess by throwing garlands
and loose flowers; they formed a most elegant dancepattern
as they beguiled the Queen of pleasures with the
tresses of Spring. Now flutes with many stops played Lydian
melodies in sweet harmony; and while these tunes were
delightfully charming the spectators’ hearts, far more delightfully
Venus started gently to move. With slow hesitant
step and smoothly undulating body and gently moving
head she began to walk forward, and to respond to the soft
sound of the flutes with delicate movements. She gestured
with her glances, now softly languid, now sharply threatening,
and sometimes she would dance with her eyes alone.

seen to promise, with a motion of her arms, that if she were
preferred over the other goddesses she would give Paris a
bride of surpassing beauty, the very image of herself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_231_18" id="target_note_LCL453_231_18"><sup>18</sup></a> At

golden apple he was holding, so casting the vote for her
