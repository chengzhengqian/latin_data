snakes lurking in the ground, and the monsters that swim
in the deep. But my talent is too feeble to speak your
praises and my inheritance too meagre to bring you sacrifices.
The fullness of my voice is inadequate to express
what I feel about your majesty; a thousand mouths and as
many tongues would not be enough, nor even an endless
flow of inexhaustible speech. I shall therefore take care to
do the only thing that a devout but poor man can: I shall
store your divine countenance and sacred godhead in the
secret places of my heart, forever guarding it and picturing
it to myself.”</p>
<p>When I had finished this prayer to the highest divinity, I
embraced the priest Mithras, who was now also a father to
me. Clinging to his neck and kissing him many times, I
asked his pardon because I was unable to reward him as he
deserved for his great favours to me.</p>
<p>Then, after a long delay<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span>
for lengthy expressions of gratitude, I finally departed
and hurried straight to visit my ancestral hearth again after
a long time away. After a few days there, at the powerful
goddess’s urging I hastily gathered my luggage together,
boarded a ship, and set out toward Rome. Safely driven by
favouring winds, I arrived very quickly at the Port of Augustus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_285_35" id="target_note_LCL453_285_35"><sup>35</sup></a>
and hurried on from there by carriage. On the
eve of the Ides of December<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_285_36" id="target_note_LCL453_285_36"><sup>36</sup></a> I reached the holy, inviolate
city. Thereafter I had no more important occupation than
praying daily to the supreme divinity of Queen Isis, who
was worshipped with the greatest reverence under the
name Campensis, derived from the site of her temple.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_285_37" id="target_note_LCL453_285_37"><sup>37</sup></a>
