a rest after the end of the journey, and that their headquarters and residence were there. We then climbed a gentle slope and arrived at our destination. Once there, after all the goods had been unpacked and stashed away and I was freed from my burden, in place of a bath I dissipated my weariness by rolling in the dust.</p>

<p>The mountain was wild, shaded with forest foliage, and pre-eminently high. Its precipitous slopes, where it was ringed with jagged and hence inaccessible rocks, were encircled by pitted, hollow gullies, well fortified by thick thorn-bushes and isolated on every side, furnishing a natural defence. From the mountain-top a flowing spring gushed out in giant bubbles and rushed down the steep sides, sending out a cascade of silvery waves; then separating into several streams and flooding the gorges with stagnant pools it filled the entire area like a lagoon or a sluggish river. Above the cave, where the edges of the mountain give out, rises a steep tower. Strong fencing of solid wickerwork of a sort suitable for confining sheep, flanked the door on either side and ran like a narrow path formed by masonry walls. You can take my word for it that here was the atrium of a band of robbers. There was nothing nearby except a tiny hut carelessly thatched with cane, where, as I later learned, lookouts chosen by lot from among the robbers kept watch at night.</p>
