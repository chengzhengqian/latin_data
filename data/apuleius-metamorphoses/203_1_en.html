citizen as a slave,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_89_15" id="target_note_LCL453_89_15"><sup>15</sup></a> why not buy yourself a good and useful
piece of property here, which can give you satisfaction
both at home and away?”</p>
<p>The offensive customer kept on asking one question
after another, and finally inquired anxiously how docile I
was.</p>
<p>“You see before you,” replied the auctioneer, “a wether,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>
not an ass: gentle for any job, not a biter, not even a kicker.
You would really think that inside this ass’s hide dwelt a
mild-mannered human being. You can prove this for yourself
with no difficulty: just shove your face between his
thighs and you can easily test by demonstration the dimensions
of his passivity.”</p>
<p>The auctioneer was poking fun at the glutton, but he
got the point of the joke and swore with pretended indignation.

suppose I could entrust the goddess to an animal who
was wild? He might suddenly upset her divine image and
throw it off his back, and I would be forced to run around

with Dionysus or Yahwe. Bellona is an Italic name for the
goddess Ma of Commagene in Asia Minor. Cybele, the mother- goddess worshipped on Mount Ida and in Pessinus in Asia Minor,
was served by priests who castrated themselves in imitation of
her consort Attis. Venus here is the Phoenician Astarte. With this
