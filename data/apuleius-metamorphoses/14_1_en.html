there,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL044_29_26" id="target_note_LCL044_29_26"><sup>26</sup></a> ready to devour me. And I was thinking that the gentle Meroe had indeed spared my throat not out of mercy, but in her cruelty had reserved me for the cross.</p>
<p>And so I went back into the bedroom and started thinking <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> about a quick form of death. But since Fortune provided me with no other death-dealing weapon than my little cot, I turned to it. ‘The time is now, my little cot,’ I said, ‘my heart’s dearest cot, you who have endured so many tribulations with me, you who know and can judge what happened last night, you who are the only witness I can summon in my trial to testify to my innocence. I am in haste to die: supply me with the weapon that will save me.’ With these words I set to work unravelling the rope which was laced into the cot-frame. Then I tossed one end of the rope over a little beam which projected into the room underneath the window and fastened it. I tied the other end securely in a noose, climbed up on to the cot, raised myself high enough for the death-drop, and fitted my head through the noose. With one foot I pushed away the support which was holding me up, so that the rope would be squeezed tight against my throat by the pull of my weight and shut off the function of breathing. Then suddenly the rope, being rotten and old, broke and I fell. I crashed down on top of Socrates, who was lying next to me, and tumbled with him on to the ground.</p>

<p>“At this, having been awakened either by our fall or by that fellow’s discordant yelling, Socrates stood up first.
