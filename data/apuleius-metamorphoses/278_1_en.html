<h2><span class="ac">Book XI</span></h2>
<p>About the first watch of the night I awoke in sudden<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span>
fright and saw, just emerging from the waves of the sea, the
full circle of the moon glistening with extraordinary brilliance.
Surrounded by the silent mysteries of dark night, I
realised that the supreme goddess now exercised the fullness
of her power; that human affairs were wholly governed
by her providence; that not only flocks and wild
beasts but even lifeless things were quickened by the divine
favour of her light and might; and that individual bodies
on land, in the sky, and in the sea grew at one period in
consequence of her waxing and diminished at another in
obedience to her waning. Since fate, it seemed, was now
satiated with the number and intensity of my sufferings,
and was offering me the hope, albeit late, of deliverance, I
decided to pray to the august image of the goddess present
before me. Quickly I shook off my sluggish sleep and arose
happily and eagerly. Desiring to purify myself I went at
once to bathe in the sea, plunging my head under the
waves seven times, because the divine Pythagoras<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_239_1" id="target_note_LCL453_239_1"><sup>1</sup></a> had declared
that number to be especially appropriate to religious
rituals. Then, my face covered with tears, I prayed to
the mighty goddess.</p>
