I could now freely observe all the tricks of that wicked
woman. The Sun had slipped right down beneath ocean
and was illuminating the subterranean zones of the world
when suddenly, clinging close beside the vile old woman,
the bold lover made his appearance. He was no more than
a boy, still conspicuous for the smooth brightness of his
cheeks, still attracting male lovers himself. Welcoming
him with a great many kisses, the woman invited him to
take his place for the dinner she had prepared.</p>
<p>As the young man was just tasting the opening cup and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>
raising the first course to the edge of his lips, her husband,
returning far more quickly than expected, appeared at the
door. Thereupon his excellent wife swore dreadful oaths
against him, wished both his legs broken and hid her lover,
who trembled in bloodless terror, under a wooden tub normally
used for sifting the pounded grain, which happened
to be lying overturned on the floor nearby. Her natural
cunning enabled her to dissemble her wicked deed and
assume a perfectly relaxed expression as she inquired of
her husband why in the world he had left supper at his best
friend’s house and returned so early.</p>
<p>He was clearly very upset, and as he answered her he
sighed repeatedly. “It was unspeakable and terrible,” he
said, “what that depraved woman did! I could not endure
it, and I rushed away to escape. Good gods, to think that
such a lady, so faithful and sober, has befouled herself so
shamefully and disgracefully! I swear by our holy Ceres

woman like that.”</p>
