togas—if nowadays all jurors hawk their verdicts for a
price, since at the world’s beginning an adjudication between
gods and men was corrupted by beauty’s influence,
and a country shepherd, chosen judge on the advice of
great Jupiter, sold the first verdict for a profit of pleasure,
resulting in the destruction of himself and his entire race?
And it was the same, by Hercules, with a second and yet
another celebrated case among the far-famed princes of
the Achaeans, when Palamedes, a man of superior learning
and wisdom, was condemned for treason because of false
accusations, or mediocre Ulysses was preferred to great
Ajax, who was supreme in martial valour.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_233_19" id="target_note_LCL453_233_19"><sup>19</sup></a> And what kind
of a trial was that one held by the Athenians, those skilful
legislators and teachers of all knowledge? Is it not true that
that divinely wise old man, whom the Delphic god pronounced
superior to all other mortals in intelligence, was
attacked by the lies and malice of an utterly worthless faction,
accused of being a corruptor of the young—whom he
was in fact keeping in rein—and murdered with the poisonous
juice of a baleful herb?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_233_20" id="target_note_LCL453_233_20"><sup>20</sup></a> He bequeathed to his fellow-citizens
the stain of eternal disgrace, because even to
this day the best philosophers choose his holy school and in
their zealous pursuit of happiness swear by his very name.</p>
<p>But I am afraid one of you may reproach me for this attack
of indignation and think to himself, “So, now are we
going to have to stand an ass lecturing us on philosophy?”
So I shall return to the story at the point where I left it.</p>

destroyed through the machinations of Ulysses, who forged a letter
from the Trojan king Priam and planted it in Palamedes’ tent.

the Greek chieftains to Ulysses, and the injury to Ajax’s pride resulted
