on my Tlepolemus’ tomb with the gore from your
eyes, and I shall dedicate those eyes as a funeral offering
to his sacred ghost. But why should you profit by a delay
in the torture you deserve and perhaps dream of my caresses
which are going to be your ruin? Leave slumber’s
darkness and wake up to another, avenging blackness. Lift
up your empty face, recognise my vengeance, understand
your misfortune, count your sufferings. This is how your
eyes gave pleasure to a virtuous woman. This is how the
marriage torches lighted your wedding chamber. The Avengers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_69_8" id="target_note_LCL453_69_8"><sup>8</sup></a>

through the town. Obviously bent on committing some act
of violence, she made straight for her husband’s tomb.
Along with the entire populace, we emptied every house as
we pursued her vigorously, urging one another to wrest the
weapon from her frantic hands. But Charite stood beside
Tlepolemus’ sarcophagus and kept everyone at bay with
her flashing sword. When she saw us all weeping profusely
and lamenting in various ways, she said to us, ‘Stop your
tears: they are untimely! Stop your mourning: it is ill suited
to my courageous deeds! I have taken vengeance on my
husband’s bloody killer; I have punished the deadly plunderer
