my instructions because it seems difficult: for at this very
moment when I come to you I am present there too and am
instructing my priest in his sleep about what he must do
next. At my command the tight-packed crowd of people
will give way before you, and no one in the midst of the joyous
rites and festive revelries will shrink from the unsightly
aspect that you present. Nor will anyone misinterpret your
sudden transformation and prefer charges against you out
of spite.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_249_21" id="target_note_LCL453_249_21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

deep in your heart the fact that the rest of your life’s course
is pledged to me until the very limit of your last breath.
Nor is it unjust that you should owe all the time you have to
live to her by whose benefit you return to the world of men.
Moreover you will live in happiness, you will live in glory,
under my guardianship. And when you have completed
your life’s span and travel down to the dead, there too, even
in the hemisphere under the earth, you will find me, whom
you see now, shining among the shades of Acheron<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_249_22" id="target_note_LCL453_249_22"><sup>22</sup></a> and
holding court in the deep recesses of the Styx, and while
you dwell in the Elysian fields I will favour you and you will
constantly worship me. But if by assiduous obedience,
worshipful service, and determined celibacy you win the
favour of my godhead, you will know that I—and I alone—can even prolong your life beyond the limits determined
by your fate.”</p>
