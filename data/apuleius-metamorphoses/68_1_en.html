She took the cover off one of these and scooped out some ointment, which she massaged for some time between her palms and then smeared all over her body from the tips of her toenails to the top of her hair. After a long secret conversation with her lamp she began to shake her limbs in a quivering tremor. While her body undulated smoothly, soft down sprouted up through her skin, and strong wing-feathers grew out; her nose hardened and curved, and her toenails bent into hooks.

Get me a little ointment from that same jar. I beg you by these pretty breasts of yours, my little honey. Bind me as your slave for ever by a favour I can never repay, and make me stand beside you now, a winged Cupid next to my Venus.”</p>
