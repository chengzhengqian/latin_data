playfulness so that it lifted to reveal the flower of her
youth, and at another moment it would gust exuberantly
against it so that it clung tightly and graphically delineated
her body’s voluptuousness. Moreover, the very colouring
of the goddess offered variety to the eye—her body white
because she comes down from heaven, her robe blue because
she comes up from the sea.</p>
<p>Each of the maidens who was acting a goddess was accompanied
by her own companions. Juno was followed by
Castor and Pollux,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_229_17a" id="target_note_LCL453_229_17a"><sup>17</sup></a> whose heads were capped with egg-shaped
helmets marked by stars at their peaks. In fact
these twin Castors were also boys from the stage-company.
Accompanied by an Ionian flute playing various tunes,
Juno stepped forward with quiet and unaffected movements,
and with lady-like gestures promised the shepherd
that if he awarded her the prize for beauty she would assign
him rule over all Asia. Now the girl whose military
equipment had turned her into Minerva was guarded
by two boys, armour-bearing companions of the battle-goddess,
Terror and Fear, who leaped forward with naked
swords. Behind their backs a piper played a martial Dorian
tune and mixed deep growls with shrill whistles like a wartrumpet,
rousing the energy of their brisk dance. She
tossed her head and glared menacingly, and with quick,
jerky gestures indicated to Paris that if he assigned her the
victory in beauty he would become, with her assistance,
brave and renowned for trophies gained in war.</p>
