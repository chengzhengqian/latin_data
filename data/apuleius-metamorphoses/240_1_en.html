brother’s death on that filthy, corrupt rich man,” and
straightway died, ripped to shreds.</p>
<p>The surviving brothers, less, by Hercules, out of desperation
than with a willing disregard for their own safety,
rushed in blazing anger toward the rich man. In an insane
attack they began pelting him with stones. But the bloody
assassin, trained by much previous practice in similar acts
of violence, hurled his lance and drove it clean through the
breast of one of the two brothers. But dead though he was,
and completely lifeless, he did not fall to earth: the spear,
which passed through his body and projected out behind
his back almost to its full length, stuck fast in the ground
from the forcefulness of the cast, and his body hung balanced
on the stiff shaft.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a tall, strong slave, coming to the murderer’s
aid, had slung a stone in a long trajectory, aimed at
the right arm of the third young man. But the blow was ineffective,
contrary to what everyone expected, and the
stone had merely grazed the tips of his fingers and fallen
harmlessly to the ground.</p>

however, presented the clever youth with a tiny hope of revenge.
Pretending that his hand was crippled, he called
out to the cruel youth. “Enjoy,” he cried, “the total destruction
of our family, and feed your insatiable cruelty on
three brothers’ blood. Hold your glorious triumph over the
fallen bodies of your fellow-citizens. But know this: although
you may rob a pauper of his holdings and extend
your property-lines farther and farther, you will still always
have a neighbour. Now even my right hand, which would
have cut your head clean off, lies smashed through Fate’s
injustice.”</p>
