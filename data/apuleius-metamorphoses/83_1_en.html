Leaving the arm where it was and staunching the wound with lots of rags lest drops of blood should betray our tracks, we hastily took the rest of Lamachus away with us. In some agitation we were beset by the loud outcry in the vicinity and frightened into flight by the terror of imminent danger—but he could neither speedily follow us nor safely remain behind.
