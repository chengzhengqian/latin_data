property of my wife and me. Instead of a probate to split an
estate, I will institute a suit to share common assets, contending
that without controversy or dissension we three
should enter into contract in the matter of one bed. You
see, I have always lived in such harmony with my spouse

of this speech, he led him off to bed. Reluctantly the
boy followed; and the miller, locking up his virtuous wife in
another room, lay alone with the boy and enjoyed the most
gratifying revenge for his ruined marriage. But when first
the Sun’s bright wheel gave birth to day, he summoned the
two strongest slaves in the house, ordered them to lift the
boy up as high as they could, and then flogged his buttocks
with a rod. “You,” he said, “you are soft and tender, you are
still a child—what are you up to, cheating lovers of the

more, and had also had his fill of punishing him with whipping,
he threw him out of the house. And so the boldest
lover in the world, having unexpectedly escaped with his
life, but with his white buttocks the worse for their treatment
both during the night and in the daytime, ran away in
tears. Nonetheless the baker gave notice of divorce to his
wife and immediately expelled her from his house.</p>
