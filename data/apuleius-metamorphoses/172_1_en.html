and joyful as I trotted ahead of him: I was now about to give
up sacks and loads altogether, I had gained my freedom,
and at the beginning of spring on the grassy meadows I
would surely find some roses. Another thought occurred to
me too: if in my capacity as an ass<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_27_18" id="target_note_LCL453_27_18"><sup>18</sup></a> I had received so much
gratitude and been awarded so many honours, I would
be honoured with much more bountiful favours when I
recovered my human appearance.</p>
<p>But when the herdsman arrived home with me, far
from the city, there were no pleasures to welcome me,
not even freedom. His wife, a greedy, utterly vile woman,
yoked me there and then to a grinding-mill, whipping
me frequently with a leafy stick, in order to make bread
for herself and her family out of my hide. Not content
merely to wear me out producing her own food, she even
hired out my treading to grind her neighbours’ grain. In
my misery I was not even given my assigned food-allowance
in exchange for my hard labours, but she took my barley,
crushed and ground it under the same millstone by
means of my own circling steps, and sold it to the farmers
nearby; as for me, who was attached all day to that wearisome
wheel, she waited until dusk and then set some bran
in front of me, unsifted, dirty, and very rough and gravelly.</p>

Fortune consigned me to new tortures, no doubt so that I
could—as they say—“boast of high distinction from brave
deeds done at home and abroad.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL453_27_19" id="target_note_LCL453_27_19"><sup>19</sup></a> For the excellent herdsman,
obedient (though late in the day) to his master’s orders,
eventually let me share the pasture with the herds
of horses. At last I was a free ass, happy and dancing as I
cavorted around with a delicate step, selecting the mares
that I thought would make the fittest concubines for me.
