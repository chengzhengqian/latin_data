truly life-giving waters. And then I calmly put up with
them clapping me with their hands, twisting my ears, tugging
at my halter, and any other test they wanted to make,
until I had clearly proved my gentleness to them all, in contrast
to their own presumption that I was mad.</p>
<p>Having thus escaped a twofold peril, I was loaded next
day with the divine spoils and led out with castanets and
cymbals on to the road again, a travelling beggars’ show.
After making stops at several small houses and walled estates,
we halted at a village built among the half-ruined remains
of a once wealthy city, as the inhabitants informed
us. We obtained lodgings at the nearest inn, and there we
heard an amusing story about the cuckolding of a certain
poor workman, which I want you to hear too.</p>
<p>Toiling in lean poverty, this man kept alive by doing<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
construction work for small pay. He had a wife, thin and
hungry like himself, but notorious as the last word in lasciviousness.
One day he left early in the morning for his
current job, and immediately an impudent lover slipped
secretly into his lodgings. While the two were happily
working away at Venus’ wrestling match, her husband unexpectedly
returned home. He was not very smart, and at
that time he did not even suspect anything of the sort.
When he found the doors closed and bolted, he mentally
commended his wife’s virtue and knocked at the door, simultaneously
announcing his presence with a whistle. The
woman, who was bright and experienced in misconduct of
this kind, loosened the man from her tight embrace and
hid him out of sight in an empty storage-jar half-buried in
the ground in the corner of the room. Then she opened the
door, and as her husband walked in she greeted him with a
bitter tirade.</p>
