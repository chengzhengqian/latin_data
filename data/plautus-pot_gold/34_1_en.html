<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ser</span><p class="lineGroup">This is the job of a deserving servant, to do what I’m making
it my aim to do: not to think of master’s command as a
botheration and a nuisance; a slave who wants to serve his
master according to his wishes must give first place to his<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">590</span><span class="br"></span>
master and second place to himself. And if he sleeps, he
should sleep in such a way that he doesn’t forget that he’s
a slave: someone who serves a lovesick master, just as I do
now, if he can see that love is gaining the upper hand over
his master, well then, I think it’s the servant’s duty to restrain
him for his own good, and not to push him further
in the direction he inclines to. Just as a raft of bulrushes is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">595</span><span class="br"></span>
put under boys who are learning to swim so that they
don’t find it so difficult and swim and move their hands
more easily, the same way I think it fair that a slave should
be a raft for a lovesick master, to support him so that he
doesn’t sink to the bottom as a fishing net does in the sea.
Let him have a perfect understanding of what his master
commands so that his eyes can read what his face wishes;
let him be in a hurry to execute his orders faster than fast<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">600</span><span class="br"></span>
chariots. A man who minds this will avoid a censor’s punishment<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_321_39" id="target_note_LCL060_321_39">

with ox-hide whips and will never make the
shackles shine at his own expense. Now my master’s in
love with the daughter of this poor chap here, Euclio.
