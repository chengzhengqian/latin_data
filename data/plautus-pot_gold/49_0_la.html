<span class="italic">The ending of the</span> Aulularia <span class="italic">was already missing in the archetype
of the Palatine family because none of the extant manuscripts
has it. Unfortunately, the Ambrosian Palimpsest does
not contain our play at all. Still, the ancient plot summaries and
a few fragments quoted by ancient scholars in order to illustrate
grammatical points allow us to reconstruct the ending.</span>

<span class="italic">Lyconides
manages to get the pot of gold from his slave and returns
it to Euclio. Euclio is touched by Lyconides’ honesty and consents
to the marriage. He realizes that the gold cannot make him
happy and gives it as a dowry to Lyconides, whose bride has
given birth to a son. Lyconides’ slave is presumably set free, like
the slave Gripus in the</span> Rudens, <span class="italic">who was equally unwilling to
part with the treasure he found.</span>
