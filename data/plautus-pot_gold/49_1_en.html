<span class="italic">Fragment i comes from another speech about women’s spending;
the speaker is probably Megadorus, but it could also be
Euclio. Fragment ii describes the behavior of Lyconides’ servant,
who stole the gold. Fragments iii and iv, both spoken by
Euclio, come from the scene in which he gives the gold to the
young couple; he describes his paranoid behavior when he still
had the gold and his hope that he will now enjoy inner peace.
Fragment v is more problematic. It could be assigned to Lyconides’
slave, who in addition to his freedom (the raw vegetables)
wants some payment (the fish sauce), just as Epidicus expects
more than merely his freedom.</span>

<span class="italic">Fragments vi and vii probably do not belong here at all. Fragment
vi, quoted by Nonius as coming from Varro’s</span> Eumenides,
<span class="italic">has sometimes been assigned to our play because of the name
Strobilus. Nonius is also the source of fragment vii, which he
says is from the</span> Aulularia. <span class="italic">However, he must be wrong because
neither the extant play itself nor the plot summaries mention a
pimp, a person that would be out of place in this comedy.</span>
