praise Euclio’s daughter: “a sensible thing to do and a
good plan.” Well, at least in my opinion, if other people
who are well off did the same, marrying the daughters of
poorer people without dowry, the city would become<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">481</span><span class="br"></span>
much more harmonious, we would suffer less from envy
than we do now, women would be much more afraid of a
hard time than they are now, and we would spend less
than we do now. For the vast majority of people this is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">485</span><span class="br"></span>
best. There’s a fight only with a handful of greedy men;
neither law nor cobbler can take the measure for their
greedy hearts and grasping natures. Well then, someone
might say: “who are those rich women with a dowry going
to marry, if this rule is laid down for the poorer ones?”
Let them marry anyone they wish, so long as no dowry<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">491</span><span class="br"></span>
accompanies them. In that case they’d acquire a better
character for themselves, which they could bring instead
of a dowry, which is what they’re bringing now. I’d make
those mules which cost more than horses cheaper than
Gallic geldings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_311_28" id="target_note_LCL060_311_28">
