anyone I’d be happier to hurt more with full intention.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">con</span><p class="lineGroup">Even if you were silent it would be obvious: the facts
speak for themselves; thanks to your clubs I’m softer than
any catamite. But why did you touch us, beggar?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">euc</span><p class="lineGroup">What? You dare ask? Is it because I did less than was fair?</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">con</span><p class="lineGroup">All I hope for is that I can take away unbroken my own
things which I brought here. Then I’m content, without
hankering for yours.</p></div>
