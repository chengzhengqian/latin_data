<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyc</span><p class="lineGroup">Because that deed which is upsetting you, well, I did it
and I admit it.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">euc</span><p class="lineGroup">What do I hear from you?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyc</span><p class="lineGroup">The truth.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">735</span><span class="br"></span>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">euc</span><p class="lineGroup">Young man, what harm have I done you to deserve that
you’d behave like this and go about ruining me and my
offspring?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyc</span><p class="lineGroup">Some god urged me to do it; he led me on.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">euc</span><p class="lineGroup">How so?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyc</span><p class="lineGroup">I admit that I’ve done wrong and that I’ve deserved your
reproach. And so I’ve come to ask you to forgive me
calmly.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">euc</span><p class="lineGroup">Why did you dare to do it, to touch what isn’t yours?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">740</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyc</span><p class="lineGroup">What do you want to happen? It’s done. It can’t be undone.
I believe it is the will of the gods: if they hadn’t
wanted it, it wouldn’t have happened, I know that.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">euc</span><p class="lineGroup">But I believe it is the will of the gods that I kill you at my
place in shackles.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyc</span><p class="lineGroup">Don’t say that.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">euc</span><p class="lineGroup">Then why did you touch what was mine without my
agreement?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyc</span><p class="lineGroup">Because I did so through the fault of wine and love.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">745</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">euc</span><p class="lineGroup">You utterly reckless individual, how dare you come here
to me with that sort of story, you shameless rascal! Well
then, if it’s legal to use your kind of excuse, we might as
well snatch jewellery from married women openly and in
broad daylight, and then, if we were caught, we could say
as an excuse that we did so while drunk and out of love.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">750</span><span class="br"></span>
Wine and love are too cheap if a man can do what he
wants when he’s drunk and in love.</p></div>
