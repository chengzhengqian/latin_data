dealings or some business with a wealthy one begins a
daring undertaking. Take Megadorus. He tries to catch a
wretch like myself in all sorts of ways, he who’s pretended

reason only: that they should steal this (<span class="italic">points to his pot</span>)

cock inside, which belonged to the old maid, came within
an inch of ruining me. It began to scrape around with its
claws, round about, at the place where the gold had been
buried. What need is there for words? My heart got so
bitter, I took a club and knocked the cock dead, the
flagrant thief. I do believe the cooks promised a reward<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">470</span><span class="br"></span>
to that cock if it revealed this. But I took the handle out of
their hands.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_309_26" id="target_note_LCL060_309_26">
