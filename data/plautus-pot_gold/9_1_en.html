this out of my loyalty and for your benefit, as is appropriate
for a true sister. Still, I’m well aware that we women
are considered a pain in the neck. Yes, we’re all considered
very gossipy, and deservedly so. In fact, people say a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">125</span><span class="br"></span>
silent woman has never been found now or in any generation.
However, my brother, keep this one thing in mind: I
am your closest relative, and you are mine. So it’s only
fair that you should advise and counsel me—and that I
should do the same for you—as to what we think benefits
each of us; this shouldn’t be kept secret or quiet out of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">131</span><span class="br"></span>
fear, but rather I should share it with you and you should
equally share it with me. That’s why I’ve taken you out
here alone now, so I can talk with you here about a private
matter concerning you.</p></div>
