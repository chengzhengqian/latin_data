<p>Though he burned with desire for war, yet Hamilcar thought that he ought to strive for peace: for he knew that his country was in financial straits and could no longer support the disasters of war. But in so doing he at once began to plan to renew the war, if only Carthage should recover a little strength, and to bear arms against the Romans until his countrymen won the victory by their valour or were defeated and gave up the contest. It was with that end in view that he conducted the negotiations, in the course of which he was so self-confident that, when Catulus declared that he would not cease from war unless his opponent and all those who defended Eryx would lay down their arms and leave Sicily, he declared that his country should fall and he himself perish before he would return home in such disgrace; for it was unworthy of his courage to surrender to her foes the arms which he had received from his country to use against her enemies.

Carthage was never in so great danger except when the city was destroyed. To begin with, the mercenary soldiers whom they had used against the Romans had revolted, to the number of twenty thousand men. They roused all Africa to rebellion and even attacked Carthage. By these troubles the Carthaginians were so greatly alarmed that they even asked help of the Romans, and obtained it. But finally, being almost reduced to despair, they made Hamilcar commander-in-chief. <span class="marginNote right">232 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></span></p>
