The senate was indignant at this, and the tribune of the plebs was subjected to a tongue-lashing on the floor of the house. Every senator then declared that the consul should reconvene the assembly so the proposal could be passed, and to reproach the people for their apathy and make them understand how damaging and humiliating such a deferral of war would be.</p>

At the voting assembly in the Campus Martius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_19_36" id="target_note_LCL295_19_36"><sup>36</sup></a> the consul called an informal gathering of the people before sending the centuries to vote,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_19_37" id="target_note_LCL295_19_37"><sup>37</sup></a> and addressed them as follows: “Citizens, I do not think you realize that what you are debating is not whether to have war or peace—Philip, who is mounting a vast land and sea offensive, will not leave you freedom of choice in the matter—but whether you are to transport your legions to Macedonia or else admit your enemy into Italy.

Instead, by our vacillating, we drew it into Italy, with disastrous consequences for ourselves. </p>
