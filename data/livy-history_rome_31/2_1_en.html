The First Macedonian War began in 215, when Philip made a treaty with Hannibal after the Roman defeat at Cannae, but the Romans then made an alliance with the Aetolians against Philip in 212 or 211. When, however, they lost interest in Greece later in the Punic War (207/6), the Aetolians, left isolated, had to make a separate peace with Philip in 206.
