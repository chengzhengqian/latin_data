Titinius, so that he could survey the battle along with them and counter any unexpected enemy maneuvers.</p>
<p>At the start the Gauls hoped that they could overpower and wipe out the right squadron<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_63_103" id="target_note_LCL295_63_103"><sup>103</sup></a> in the front line by attacking in full force at a single point. Achieving little success with this, they attempted to encircle the wings and outflank their enemy’s line, an apparently simple maneuver, since they had large numbers facing a few. The praetor saw this happening, and in order to extend his fighting line he added the two supporting Roman legions to the right and left of the squadron fighting in the front line; and he also vowed a temple to Vediovis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_63_104" id="target_note_LCL295_63_104"><sup>104</sup></a> should he defeat the enemy that day. He then ordered Lucius Valerius to unleash cavalry (that of the two legions on the one side, that of the allies on the other) against the flanks of the enemy, and not permit them to encircle the line. At the same time, the consul could himself see that the Gauls’ center had been weakened by their extending their wings, and he ordered his men to attack en masse and break through their lines. Thus the flanks were driven back by the cavalry and the center by the infantry and, subjected now to massive slaughter everywhere, the Gauls suddenly turned and headed back to camp in a disordered rout. The Roman cavalry chased them as they fled; and soon the legions followed and attacked the camp. Fewer than 6,000 men made good their escape; more than 35,000 were cut down or captured, along with 70 military standards and more than 200 Gallic wagons loaded with ample booty.
