 to reach a hastily erected inner wall, they sent an embassy to the king to discuss terms for the town’s surrender. The agreement they were seeking from Philip was that the Rhodian quadrireme with its crew,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_53_89" id="target_note_LCL295_53_89"><sup>89</sup></a> and the relief force of Attalus, be allowed to depart while they themselves should leave the city with one piece of clothing each.</p>
