They requested, therefore, that the king be given the title “King, Ally, and Friend” by the senate. The reply given to the embassy was that Vermina’s father, Syphax, had also suddenly and inexplicably become a foe of the Roman people after being an ally and friend, and that Vermina himself had devoted his early years to harassing the Romans. He should therefore ask for peace from the Roman people before he could be styled “King, Ally, and Friend,” a title that was traditionally an honor the Roman people conferred as a reward for important services rendered to them by foreign kings. There was going to be a Roman embassy to Africa, they said, and the senate would dictate to it the terms of the peace treaty for Vermina, who should leave to the Roman people full authority as to its conditions.
