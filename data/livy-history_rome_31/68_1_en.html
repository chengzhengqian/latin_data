Attic mainland—twenty light craft from Issa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_137_177" id="target_note_LCL295_137_177"><sup>177</sup></a> joined the Roman fleet. These were dispatched to conduct raids on the territory of the people of Carystus, and the rest of the fleet docked at the famous Euboean port of Geraestus to await the return of the Issaei from Carystus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_137_178" id="target_note_LCL295_137_178"><sup>178</sup></a> Then they all put out to sea together and, passing in midvoyage the island of Scyrus, came to Icus. They were detained there for a few days by a furious north wind, but as soon as good weather arrived they crossed to Sciathus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_137_179" id="target_note_LCL295_137_179"><sup>179</sup></a> where the city had been recently destroyed and pillaged by Philip. The soldiers roamed through the fields and brought back to the ships grain and whatever else might serve for provisions; but there was no booty, nor had the Greeks here deserved to suffer depredations. Then, en route for Cassandrea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_137_180" id="target_note_LCL295_137_180"><sup>180</sup></a> they headed first for Mendaeum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_137_181" id="target_note_LCL295_137_181"><sup>181</sup></a> a coastal village of that city. Next, after rounding the headland, they wanted to bring the fleet right up to the city walls, but a violent storm arose during which they were almost sunk by the waves. Scattered, and with most of their tackle lost, they sought refuge on land.</p>
<p>The storm at sea also served as an omen for their performance on land. After reuniting the ships and setting the troops ashore, the allies assaulted the town, only to be driven back with heavy casualties (the king’s garrison there was powerful); and after the failure of the operation they withdrew and crossed to Canastraeum in Pallene. From there they rounded the promontory of Torona and set a course for Acanthus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_137_182" id="target_note_LCL295_137_182"><sup>182</sup></a> Here they first raided the countryside, and then took the city by storm and pillaged it.
