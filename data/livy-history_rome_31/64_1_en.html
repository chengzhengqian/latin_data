Many Aetolians were again captured or cut down in this terror-stricken flight. Had there been sufficient daylight left, Philip had no doubt that he could have taken their camp from the Athamanians; but as it was the day had been used up in combat and then in pillaging the Aetolian camp, and so he took up a position on the level ground closest to him at the foot of the hillock, intending to attack the enemy at first light the following day. The Aetolians, however, prey to the same panic that had made them abandon their camp, scattered and fled that oncoming night. Amynander provided them with the greatest assistance: it was under his leadership that the Athamanians who knew the roads led them back into Aetolia over the mountain tops on tracks unknown to the enemy pursuing them.
