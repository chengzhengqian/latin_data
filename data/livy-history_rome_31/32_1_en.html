The Carthaginian commander Hamilcar fell in the battle,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_65_105" id="target_note_LCL295_65_105"><sup>105</sup></a> as did three Gallic generals of noble birth. As many as 2,000 freeborn captives from Placentia were restored to their colony.</p>

It was a great victory, one that brought joy to Rome; and when the dispatch arrived a three-day period of supplication<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_65_106" id="target_note_LCL295_65_106"><sup>106</sup></a> was declared. Up to 2,000 Romans and allies fell in the battle, most of them from the squadron on the right, against which the massive enemy assault had been directed at the start of the engagement. Hostilities had been virtually brought to a conclusion thanks to the praetor; even so, after finishing all the business required of him in Rome, the consul Gaius Aurelius also set out for Gaul and assumed command of the victorious army from the praetor.</p>

Gaius Claudius and the Roman triremes had been detached from the fleet moored at Corcyra and sent to Athens, as noted above, and their arrival in Piraeus had brought high hopes to the dispirited allies. For one thing, overland raids on Athenian farmlands, which had been made regularly from Corinth by way of Megara, now no longer occurred; and, secondly, pirate ships from Chalcis, formerly a menace to the Athenians not just on the open sea but also in all their coastal farmland, no longer even dared to venture into the open sea beyond the strait of Euripus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_65_108" id="target_note_LCL295_65_108"><sup>108</sup></a> and

Cornelius Cethegus’ triumph over the Gallic Insubres and Cenomani (33.23.5). It seems more likely, however, that he did die in this battle and that the other version is embellishment by a Roman source of Livy to bring credit to the influential Cornelian family.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL295_65_105').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL295_65_106"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL295_65_106" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">106</sup>On <span class="italic">supplicatio,</span> see 8.2 note, above.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL295_65_106').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL295_65_107"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL295_65_107" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">107</sup>P.
