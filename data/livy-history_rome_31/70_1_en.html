sent to patrol off Zelasium, a promontory of Phthiotis lying in a key position above Demetrias, to guard against any movement by the Macedonian ships from that quarter. Heraclides, the king’s lieutenant,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_141_186" id="target_note_LCL295_141_186"><sup>186</sup></a> commanded the fleet in the area, and his plan of action was to capitalize on his enemy’s negligence rather than risk open force.</p>
<p>The Romans and King Attalus proceeded to assault Oreus from opposite directions, the Romans on the side of the coastal citadel, and the king’s forces attacking the valley that lay between the two citadels, where the city was also cut off by a wall. As their points of attack differed, so too did their manner of attack, the Romans bringing up to the walls tortoise formations, siege sheds, and a battering ram, and the king’s troops using ballistae, catapults, and all other kinds of artillery to shower bolts and rocks of enormous weight on the enemy. They also dug tunnels and used whatever else had proved effective in the previous assault.

As more time was thus being spent there than the legate had anticipated, and more hope now lay in siege works than a swift assault, the legate also felt that some other operation could be attempted in the meantime. He therefore left what he considered a sufficiently large force to complete the siege works, crossed to the part of the mainland closest to him and, with a sudden advance, captured Larisa—not the famous city in Thessaly, but the other one, which they call Cremaste—
