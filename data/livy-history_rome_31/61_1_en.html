already withdrawing from Macedonia he sent Athenagoras against them at the head of some light infantry and most of the cavalry. Athenagoras had orders to put pressure on the tail end of the retreating Dardanians and, by wearing down their rearguard, make them reluctant to move their troops from home in future. As for the Aetolians, the man responsible for the delay in the declaration of war at Naupactus, their praetor Damocritus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_123_166" id="target_note_LCL295_123_166"><sup>166</sup></a> had incited them to arms at the next meeting of their council. This followed the news of the cavalry engagement at Otolobus, the invasion of Macedonia by the Dardanians and Pleuratus together with the Illyrians, and especially the arrival at Oreus of the Roman fleet, with the further threat of a naval blockade on Macedonia, which was already surrounded by all these many peoples.</p>

Such were the factors that had brought Damocritus and the Aetolians back to the Romans and now, joined by Amynander, king of the Athamanians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_123_167" id="target_note_LCL295_123_167"><sup>167</sup></a> they set off and laid siege to Cercinium.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_123_168" id="target_note_LCL295_123_168"><sup>168</sup></a> The townspeople had shut their gates, though whether under duress or of their own volition is unclear (because they had a garrison of the king in town). At all events, within a few days, Cercinium was taken and burned down; and the survivors of this major catastrophe, free and slave, were hauled off with the rest of the booty. Fear of similar treatment drove all who lived around the Marsh of Boebe to abandon their towns and head for the hills; but, plunder being in short supply, the Aetolians turned aside from the area and proceeded to march on Perrhaebia. Here they stormed and shamefully pillaged Chyretiae, but they accepted the voluntary surrender of the inhabitants of Malloea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_123_169" id="target_note_LCL295_123_169"><sup>169</sup></a> and made them allies.</p>
