<p>The siege works around Oreus were now nearing completion, and the garrison within was also exhausted because of the unremitting toil, the sleepless days as well as sleepless nights, and wounds. In addition, sections of the wall had collapsed at many points from the pounding of the battering ram, and the Romans, making their way through a breach at night, broke into the citadel that is situated above the harbor. When at dawn a signal was given by the Romans from the citadel, Attalus also burst into the city through the walls that were now mostly in ruins. The garrison and the townspeople sought refuge in the other citadel, and from it surrendered two days later. The city was awarded to the king, the prisoners to the Romans.</p>

Leaving thirty ships there, Apustius then sailed past Malea to Corcyra. The king was detained until the appointed time of the rites of Ceres, since he wished to take part in the ceremony. After the rites, he too withdrew to Asia, sending home Acesimbrotus and the Rhodians. Such were that summer’s operations against Philip and his allies conducted on land and sea by the Roman consul and his legate, assisted by King Attalus and the Rhodians.</p>
