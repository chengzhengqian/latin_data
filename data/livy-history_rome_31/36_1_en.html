road about a mile long leading to the gymnasium of the academy offered the enemy’s infantry and cavalry space to move freely. The Athenians, along with the garrison of Attalus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_73_116" id="target_note_LCL295_73_116"><sup>116</sup></a> and Dioxippus’ unit, drew up their battle line inside the gate and sallied forth by this road. When Philip saw this he thought he had the advantage of his enemy and that his anger was going to be assuaged by the bloodbath he had long desired (for none of the Greek city-states was more detested by him). He urged his men to look at him as they fought and to be aware that the standards and the battle should be concentrated just where their king was to be found.

He rode with a few of his cavalrymen some distance ahead of his battle line and into the thick of the enemy, and simultaneously inspired great fervor in his own men and great alarm in the foe. In person he followed up large numbers of the enemy whom he had with his own hand wounded at close quarters or at long range, and whom he had driven back to the gate; and, after inflicting yet further slaughter on the panicking Athenians in the narrow gateway, he none the less, in this reckless enterprise, secured a safe retreat because the men on the turrets above the gate held back their missiles for fear of hitting their own comrades who were intermingled with the enemy.</p>
