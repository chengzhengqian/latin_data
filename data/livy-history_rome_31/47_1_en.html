what further charge have they left me, or anyone else, to bring against him? Bear in mind that the very same protests are voiced by the peoples of Cios, Abydus, Aenus, Maronea, Thasos, Paros, Samos, Larisa, and—here in Achaea—Messene;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_95_143" id="target_note_LCL295_95_143"><sup>143</sup></a> and that they are all the more severe and bitter in these cases because there he had wider scope to inflict damage.</p>
<p>“As for the allegations he made against us, I admit there can be no defense—unless the exploits in question actually redound to our credit. Rhegium, Capua, and Syracuse are the basis of his criticisms. In the case of Rhegium, the Rhegians themselves pleaded with us to send them assistance in the war with Pyrrhus, but the legion sent to protect the town illicitly took possession of the city it had been sent to defend.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_95_144" id="target_note_LCL295_95_144"><sup>144</sup></a> Did we condone this crime? Or did we rather attack the offending legion, bring it back under our control, force it to atone to our allies with floggings and executions, and then restore to the people of Rhegium their city, their lands, and all their possessions along with their independence and legal system? Syracuse suffered under foreign tyrants,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_95_145a" id="target_note_LCL295_95_145a"><sup>145</sup></a> so her lot was all the more unbearable. We brought assistance and were well nigh exhausted by a three-year land and sea offensive against the city,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_95_146" id="target_note_LCL295_95_146"><sup>146</sup></a> which was very well fortified. But though the Syracusans themselves expressed a preference for serving their tyrants to being captured by us, we restored their city to them, captured and liberated by the same armed intervention.</p>
