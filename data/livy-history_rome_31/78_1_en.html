<h3><span class="ac">SUMMARY OF BOOK XXXI</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The causes of the renewal of war with King Philip of Macedon, which had been interrupted, are given as follows. At the time of the Mysteries two Acarnanian youths who had not been initiated came to Athens and entered the sanctuary of Ceres along with some other compatriots of theirs. For this they were killed by the Athenians on the grounds of having committed a most heinous crime. Enraged by the death of their fellow citizens, the Acarnanians sought assistance from Philip to avenge them and attacked Athens, and the Athenians sought assistance from the Romans a few months after the Carthaginians had been granted a peace treaty. When ambassadors of the Athenians, who were under siege from Philip, sought assistance from the senate and the senate voted that this should be given, the plebs remonstrated because the relentless hardship of so many wars was crushing them; but the authority of the senate prevailed, so that the people, too, decreed that help be brought to an allied city-state. The war was assigned to the consul Publius Sulpicius who led his army into Macedonia and successfully engaged Philip in some cavalry battles. The people of Abydus, under siege from Philip, killed their families and themselves following the example of the people of Saguntum.</p>
