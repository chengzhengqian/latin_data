The consul Gaius Aurelius had specified a date for his army to assemble in Etruria; but after Purpureo’s letter was read out in the senate, the senators decided that he should issue orders for those troops to muster at Ariminum on that same day. He was then to set off in person, if the interests of the state permitted, to suppress the uprising in Gaul. Otherwise, he was to inform the praetor by letter that, when the legions from Etruria reached him, he should send 5,000 allies to replace them and these would serve temporarily as a garrison for Etruria. Aurelius was then to set out himself to raise the siege of the colony.</p>
<p>The senate also voted to send ambassadors to Africa, both to Carthage and to Masinissa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_33_58" id="target_note_LCL295_33_58"><sup>58</sup></a> in Numidia. They were to report to Carthage that one of their citizens, Hamilcar, who had been left behind in Gaul—though it was unclear whether he belonged to Hasdrubal’s earlier or Mago’s later army<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_33_59a" id="target_note_LCL295_33_59a"><sup>59</sup></a>—was engaging in warfare in contravention of their treaty, and that he had incited Gallic and Ligurian forces to arms against the Roman people.

Mago arrived in Liguria by sea in 205 with some 14,000 men (28.46.7) but was defeated and died while returning to Africa.
