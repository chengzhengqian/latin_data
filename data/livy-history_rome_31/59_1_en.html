The king also encamped not far there, constructing a palisade on the banks of a stream that local people call the Erigonus. Then, reliably informed that the Romans would make for Eordaea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_119_160" id="target_note_LCL295_119_160"><sup>160</sup></a> he moved forward to seize the pass so as to prevent his enemy from penetrating the narrow gorge that formed the entrance to it. He hurriedly fortified the spot in various ways according to the requirements of the terrain or the availability of materials—a rampart here, a ditch there, a pile of stones to serve as a wall or trees as a barrier—and by blocking off every passage with these contrivances he rendered impassable, so he thought, a road that was already difficult by its very nature.</p>
