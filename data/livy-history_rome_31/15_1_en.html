Then, led by the Carthaginian Hamilcar—a former member of Hasdrubal’s army who had stayed on in the region—they had overrun Placentia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL295_31_54" id="target_note_LCL295_31_54"><sup>54</sup></a> They had sacked the city, set fire to most of it in their rage, and left behind barely 2,000 men amid the burning ruins.
