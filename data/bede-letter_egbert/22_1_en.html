that three-headed dog of the lowest pit, to which fables have given the name of Cerberus, from the rage of whose teeth the apostle John warneth us, saying:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL248_489_1" id="target_note_LCL248_489_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Dearly beloved, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world.” Such are the few words we have spoken against the poison of greed. But if I should wish to treat in like manner concerning drunkenness, revellings, wantonness, and all other plagues of this sort, the length of this letter would be beyond measure extended.</p>
<p>May the grace of the chief Shepherd keep you continually in safety, bishop dearly beloved in Christ, for the wholesome feeding of His sheep. Written on the 5th day of November, in the third indiction.</p>
