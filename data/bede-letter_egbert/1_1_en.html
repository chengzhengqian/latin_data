This letter seems to have been Bede’s last work, about 30 years, as he says, after king Aldfrid’s death, which took place in 705.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL248_447_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL248_447_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL248_447_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>733.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL248_447_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
