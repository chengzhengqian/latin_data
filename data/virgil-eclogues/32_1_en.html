<p>As you would have your swarms shun the yews of Corsica, and your heifers browse on clover and swell their udders, begin, if you have aught to sing. Me, too, the Pierian maids have made a poet; I, too, have songs; me also the shepherds call a bard, but I trust them not. For as yet, methinks, I sing nothing worthy of a Varius or a Cinna, but cackle as a goose<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL063_87_20" id="target_note_LCL063_87_20">

<p>That’s what I’m about, Lycidas, silently turning it over in my mind, in case I can recall it. And no mean song it is. “Come to me, Galatea! What pleasure lives in waves? Here is rosy spring; here, by the streams, Earth scatters her flowers of a thousand hues; here the white poplar bends over the cave, and the clinging vines weave shady bowers. Come to me; leave the wild waves to lash the shore.”</p>

<p>What of the lines I heard you singing alone beneath the cloudless night? The tune I remember, could I but keep the words. “Daphnis, why are you gazing at the old constellations rising? See! the star<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL063_87_21" id="target_note_LCL063_87_21">

</a> of Caesar, seed of Dione, has gone forth—the star to make the fields glad with corn, and the grape deepen its hue on the sunny hills. Graft your pears, Daphnis; your children’s children shall gather the fruits you have sown.”</p>
