<p>Sweet are the showers to the corn, the arbute to the new-weaned kids, to the breeding flock the bending willow, and to me none but Amyntas!</p>

<p>Pollio loves my Muse, homely though she be: Pierian maids, feed fat a calf for your reader.</p>

<p>May he who loves you, Pollio, come where he rejoices that you, too, have come! For him may honey flow and the bramble bear spices!</p>
