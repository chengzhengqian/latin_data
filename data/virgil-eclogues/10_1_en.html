</p>
<p>With Jove my song begins; of Jove all things are full. He makes the earth fruitful; he cares for my verses.</p>
<p>

<p>I have sent my boy—’twas all I could—ten golden apples, picked from a tree in the wood. Tomorrow I will send a second ten.</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">damoetas</span>
</p>
<p>O how many and how sweet the things that Galatea has whispered to me! Waft some part of them to the gods, ye winds.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>What good is it, Amyntas, that you scorn me not in heart, if while <span class="italic">you</span> pursue the boars, <span class="italic">I</span> am left to look after the nets?</p>
<p>

<p>Send Phyllis to me; it is my birthday, Iollas. When I sacrifice a heifer for the harvest, come yourself.</p>
