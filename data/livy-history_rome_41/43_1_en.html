so to speak, of human ties? Assume that Philip <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 174</span>
has done something for which we should pass this decree against him when he was armed and waging war; what has Perseus deserved, a new king, innocent of all wrong, who now wipes out by his kindness the memory of his father’s quarrels, that we alone of all men should be his enemies? And yet I might have said even this, that so great were the benefits conferred upon us by former kings of Macedonia that they, especially now that he is dead, wipe out the memory of wrongs committed by Philip alone, if perchance there were such. Does it not come to mind that when the Roman fleet lay at Cenchreae and the consul with his army was at Elatia, we spent three days in the council deliberating whether we should follow the Romans or Philip?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_269_1" id="target_note_LCL332_269_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Grant that no immediate fear of the Romans affected our judgment: there was certainly something, nevertheless, which caused so long consideration; and this was our long-standing association with the Macedonians and the ancient and great services rendered us by their kings. Let the ancient arguments prevail even now, not to make us conspicuously their friends, but to prevent our being conspicuously their enemies. Let us not pretend, Callicrates, that the question is being settled which is not being settled. No one counsels us to make a new alliance or conclude a new treaty by which we may without knowing it entangle ourselves in difficulties; only intercourse of proffering and receiving justice, and that we shall not exclude ourselves from the territory of the kingdom by barring our frontiers to them; that it may not be permitted our slaves to flee anywhere—how is that against the Roman treaties?
