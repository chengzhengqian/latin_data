By the abuse of this law some were injuring the allies, some the Roman people. For in the first place, in order to evade the requirement that they should leave offspring at home, they would give their sons to any Romans whatsoever in slavery, on the condition that they should be manumitted and thus become citizens of freedman condition;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_209_5a" id="target_note_LCL332_209_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> in the second place, those who had no offspring to leave behind, in order to become Roman citizens adopted children.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_209_6" id="target_note_LCL332_209_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Later, disdaining
