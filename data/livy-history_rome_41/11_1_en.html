twenty-five denarii each to the infantry, twice that sum to centurions, and thrice to the cavalry; the allies shared on the same terms with the Romans.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_205_1" id="target_note_LCL332_205_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>About this time it chanced that the consul Marcus Junius came from Histria to Rome in order to hold the elections. When the tribunes of the people, Papirius and Licinius, had worn him out in the senate with questions as to what had happened in Histria, they finally haled him before an assembly. When the consul said in reply that he had spent not more than eleven days in that province, and that what had happened in his absence he, like the tribunes, knew only from report, they continued to pursue the matter, inquiring why in the world Aulus Manlius rather than himself had not come to Rome, in order to render an account to the Roman people of the reason why he had gone from the province of Gaul, which he had obtained from the lot, over into Histria? When, they asked, had the senate decreed that war? When had the Roman people ordered that war? But, by Hercules, he will say that although the war was undertaken on his own initiative, it was conducted wisely and courageously.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_205_2" id="target_note_LCL332_205_2"><sup>2</sup></a> On the contrary, they said, it was impossible to say whether it was undertaken more improperly or prosecuted more imprudently. Two outposts were surprised by the Histrians, a Roman camp captured, and all the infantry and cavalry in the camp slaughtered, the rest, unarmed and routed, the consul himself leading the way, had fled to the sea and the ships! As a private citizen Manlius would give account of his actions, since he had refused to do this as a consul.</p>
