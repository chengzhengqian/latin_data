Livy’s narrative recognizes the rashness of Petilius (cf. especially
<span class="italic">incautius ante signa</span> in sec. 4), but the senate seems to have emphasized his bravery when it decreed that the legion was remiss in the performance of its duty, that its year’s pay should be withheld and its wages reduced: cf. Valerius Maximus II. vii. 15 (confirmed by the briefer account in Frontinus, <span class="italic">Stratagems</span>
IV. i. 46): Graviter senatus tulit, quod Q. Petilium consulem
fortissime adversus Ligures pugnantem occidere milites passi essent. Legioni neque stipendium anni procedere neque aera dari voluit, quia pro salute imperatoris se telis non obtulerant.<span class="linebreak"></span>

It is obviously concerned with this year, since at no other time covered by this Book did both the regular consuls die in office. It appears that a <span class="italic">consul suffectus,</span> i.e. one elected to fill a vacancy, could not preside at an election. Their only recourse, then, was the appointment of an interrex, and this procedure and the elections for the year 175 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> were no doubt described in the text lost between <span class="italic">posse</span> and <span class="italic">deduxit.</span> The last word may refer to some such compulsory migrations as described in XL. xxxviii. 2 ff.<span class="linebreak"></span>
The names of the magistrates for 175 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> can be recovered from the Fasti and other sources. The consuls were Mucius Scaevola (xix. 1 below) and M. Aemilius Lepidus II (Oros. IV. xx. 34). The praetors were C. Popilius Laenas, T. Anniua Luscus, C. Memmius Gallus (?), C. Cluvius Saxula, Ser. Cornelius Sulla, Ap.
