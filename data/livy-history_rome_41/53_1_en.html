The Vestal Virgins were exempt, and might devise as they chose (Cicero, <span class="italic">De Republica,</span> III. 10). However, legacies might be made to women, and their share, if there was no will, was not limited (Cicero, <span class="italic">loc. cit.</span>). The law continued: ne cui plus legatorum nomine mortisve causa capere liceret quam heredes caperent, si plus legarit quam ad heredem heredesve perveniat (Gaius II. 226), <span class="italic">i.e.,</span> probably no single legatee might receive more than the residual estate falling to the heir or heirs.
