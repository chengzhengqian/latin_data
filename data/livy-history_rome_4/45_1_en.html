Seeing that the opposing forces occupied two camps with a little space between, the Roman generals followed their example
and encamped about a mile from the enemy, the dictator nearer to Tusculum and the consul to Lanuvium. Thus the four armies in their four intrenchments
had in their midst a field of sufficient extent not merely for small preliminary skirmishes but even for drawing up lines of battle on both sides. Nor from the moment the Romans had pitched their camp near that of the enemy did they once cease skirmishing; and the dictator was well content that his men should match their strength against their adversaries, and by trying the outcome of these contests
come, little by little, to count upon a general victory. The enemy in consequence abandoned all hope of success in a regular battle and attacked the consul’s camp at night, committing their cause to the hazard of a dangerous enterprise. The shout which suddenly broke out aroused not only the consul’s sentries and after them his entire army, but the dictator as well. When circumstances required instant action, the consul proved to be wanting neither in resolution nor in judgment. With a part of his soldiers he reinforced the guards at the gates; with a part he lined the palisade. In the other camp, with the dictator, there was less confusion and a correspondingly clearer perception what was needful to be done. Reinforcements were immediately sent to the consul’s camp, under Spurius Postumius Albus
