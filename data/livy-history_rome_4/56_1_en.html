Will you not seize these self-same brands, and each for himself—if we must fight with fire, not with javelins—attack them with their own weapons? Come, call to mind the Roman name, your fathers’ valour and your own; turn this blaze upon the enemy’s city and destroy Fidenae with its own flames, since your kindness was powerless
to gain its friendship! The blood of your envoys and your colonists and your devastated borders exhort you to do as I say.” At the dictator’s command the whole array was set in motion. Here they caught up torches which had been flung away; there they wrested them violently from their bearers: both sides were armed with fire. The master of the horse on his part invented a new kind of cavalry-fighting. Commanding
his men to pull off the bridles from their horses, he led the way, and setting spurs to his own, was carried by the unbridled charger into the midst of the flames. The other horses too were urged on and bore their riders at full tilt against the enemy; while the dust that rose and mingled with the smoke darkened the eyes both of the men and of their mounts. But the sight which had frightened the infantry had no terror for the horses, and the cavalry overthrew their enemies in heaps wherever they advanced. Then a new shout was heard. Both armies in astonishment looked that way; and when the dictator called out that Quinctius the lieutenant and his followers had assailed the enemy in the rear, the cheering was renewed, and he pressed home his own attack more sharply.
