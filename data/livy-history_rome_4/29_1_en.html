these Lucius Quinctius, son of Cincinnatus, from <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 438</span>whose dictatorship men were trying to derive the odium for inspiring a mutiny. Aemilius Mamercus, a man of the highest standing, was ahead of Quinctius in the voting; Lucius Julius was elected third.</p>
<p>XVII. During the term of these magistrates, <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 437</span>Fidenae, a Roman colony, revolted to Lars Tolumnius and the Veientes. To their defection they added a worse crime, for when Gaius Fulcinius, Cloelius Tullus, Spurius Antius, and Lucius Roscius, Roman envoys, came to inquire the reason of this new policy, at the command of Tolumnius they put them to death. Some persons seek to palliate the king’s act, saying that an ambiguous expression of his upon a lucky throw of dice, which made him seem to order them to kill the envoys, was heard by the Fidenates and was responsible for the men’s death. But it is quite incredible that the king on being interrupted by the Fidenates, his new allies, come to consult him about a murder that would violate the law of nations, should not have withdrawn his attention
from the game, and that the attribution of the crime to a mistake did not come later. It is easier to believe that he wished the people of Fidenae to be involved by the consciousness of so heinous a deed, that it might be impossible for them to hope for any reconciliation with the Romans. The envoys who had been slain at Fidenae were honoured, at the public cost, with statues on the Rostra.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL133_313_1" id="target_note_LCL133_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> With the Veientes and Fidenates, not only because they were neighbouring peoples, but also in consequence of the nefarious act with which they had begun the war, a bitter struggle now impended.</p>
