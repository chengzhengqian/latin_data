<p>XXIII. That the same consuls were re-elected <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 434</span>the following year (Julius for a third and Verginius for a second term) I find stated by Licinius Macer: Valerius Antias and Quintus Tubero give Marcus Manlius and Quintus Sulpicius as the consuls for that year. For the rest, in spite of the great discrepancy
in their statements, both Tubero and Macer cite the authority of the Linen Rolls; neither writer dissembles the fact that the elder historians had recorded that there were military tribunes for that year. Licinius sees fit to follow without hesitation the Linen Rolls: Tubero is uncertain where the truth lies. With all the other matters which are shrouded in antiquity this question too may be left undecided.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL133_331_1" id="target_note_LCL133_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>There was great alarm in Etruria in consequence of the capture of Fidenae. Not only were the people of Veii terrified by the fear of a similar disaster, but the Faliscans too remembered that they had commenced
the war in alliance with the Fidenates, although they had not supported them in their revolt. Accordingly when the two states, sending envoys round amongst the twelve cities, had obtained their consent to have a council proclaimed for all Etruria at the shrine of Voltumna, the senate, feeling that they were threatened with a great outbreak in that quarter, ordered that Mamercus Aemilius be again named dictator. By him Aulus Postumius Tubertus was appointed master of the horse, and preparations for war were set about as much more energetically than on the last occasion, as the danger from all Etruria was greater than it had been from two cities.</p>

that consuls were in office.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL133_331_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
