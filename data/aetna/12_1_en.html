go on through the ages, and is the fabric fixed secure with everlasting chain?), to know the limit of the sun’s track and the measure by which the moon’s orbit falls short thereof (so that in her shorter course she flies through twelve rounds while he has a yearly path), to know what stars run in constant order and which stray irregularly from their true orbit, to know likewise the changes of the zodiac-signs and their immemorial laws [that six be sped during the Highland as many return with the dawn],<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_381_a" id="target_note_LCL284_381_a">
