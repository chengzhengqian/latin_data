proper to its use. At one time the hot liquid of sulphur burns continuously; at another a fluid presents itself thickened with copious alum; oily bitumen is at hand and everything that by close encounter provokes flames to violence. Of such substance is Aetna composed. And to show<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_397_a" id="target_note_LCL284_397_a">

</a> Some of this fuel lies obvious to the sight; in its solid part it is hard—a stone; but it contains an oily juice in which burns fire. Moreover, in divers places all over the mountain there are rocks of no specific name which liquefy. To them has been given a true and steadfast guardianship of flame. But the paramount source of that volcanic fire is the lava-stone. It above all claims Aetna for its own. If perchance you held it in your hand and tested it by its firmness, you would not think it could burn or discharge fire, but no sooner do you question it with iron than it replies, and sparks attest its pain beneath the blow. Throw it into the midst of a strong fire, and let it wrest away its proud temper: so strip it of its strength. It will fuse quicker than iron, for its nature is subject to change and afraid of hurt under pressure from fire. But once it has absorbed the flames, there is no safer home for what is absorbed; preserving its edge, it hardens with steadfast fidelity what it confines. Such is its endurance after being

The author proceeds (398–425) to argue that stones which liquefy, especially the lava-stone (<span class="italic">lapis molaris</span>) point to the same conclusion. Though a chief cause of volcanic conflagration, the lava-stone externally does not look inflammable; if struck, however, with an iron bar, it gives off sparks, and in a powerful furnace is more quickly fusible than iron. Its great characteristic is its stubborn retention of fire: this marks it off from other substances which, once burnt out, cannot be rekindled.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL284_397_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
