<p>Besides, we must believe that beneath the earth there arise causes of winds like those we see above ground; so that, whenever closely massed particles press against each other, they are forced out into a free space and escape the crush, and by their motive energy whirl and drag what is nearest along in their course, halting only when a safe position is reached.
But perhaps you may be at variance with me in

In the first example, the readings suggested give a choice among a variety of contrivances. If <span class="italic">ora</span> is read, the Siren-like horn might be on the sea-shore, or on the Tiber-bank during one of Julius Caesar’s <span class="italic">naumachiae</span>, or at Lake Fucinus when the emperor Claudius exhibited a naval spectacle in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 53 (Suet. <span class="italic">Claud.</span> xxi). If <span class="italic">duci</span> were a certain correction and if it were then clear that only Claudius was meant, the passage would assist (as some have tried to make it assist) in dating the poem. The reading <span class="italic">hora</span> implies a hydraulic time-machine for announcing the hour to gods or men (<span class="italic">deo</span>?, <span class="italic">deis</span>?, <span class="italic">duci</span>?). Ellis’ <span class="italic">urna</span> is meant to denote a hydraulic vessel fitted to work the “Triton.” The second comparison is concerned with a hydraulic organ of a sort known in Rome from Cicero’s time
(<span class="italic">Tusc. Disp.</span> III. 18 (43), <span class="italic">hydrauli hortabere ut audiat voces potius quam Platonis ? i.e.</span> “will you advise him to listen to the notes of a water-organ rather than to the words of Plato?”) . The invention is ascribed to Ctesibius, a barber of Alexandria, <span class="italic">circ.</span> 200 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> Nero was almost madly interested in water-organs (Suet. <span class="italic">Nero</span> xli and liv) .</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL284_387_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL284_387_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL284_387_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>

Villa zu Nennig,</span> Bonn, 1864–65) . There the position of the organ-player is consistent with his using his hands to play and his feet on a pedal to set the water in motion. In May 1931, a handsome hydraulic organ dating from <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 288 was discovered at Aquincum on the Danube, the capital of Lower Pannonia (now Alt-Ofen, part of Buda Pest) .</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL284_387_b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
