Well then, confine it in a narrow white-hot furnace—it cannot endure or stand firm against that fierce foe. It is vanquished: it relaxes its strength; in its captor’s grip it melts. Now, what greater engines, think you, can skill apply with the hand, or what fires can it support with our human resources to compare with the mighty furnaces with which Aetna burns, ever the mother of secret fire? Yet her fire is not of the limited heat within our own experience, but more akin to that of heaven or the kind of flame with which Jupiter himself is armed. With these mighty forces is allied the gigantic volcanic spirit forced out of straitened jaws, as when mechanics hasten to pit their strength against masses of natural iron, they stir the fires and, expelling the wind from panting bellows, rouse the current in close array. Such is the manner of its working: so goes far-famed Aetna’s burning. The earth draws in forces through her perforations; volcanic spirit compresses these into narrow space, and the path of conflagration lies through the mightiest rocks.</p>
<p>Over the paths of the sea, through all that borders on ghastly ways of death, we hasten to visit the stately glories of man’s achievement and temples elaborate with human wealth or to rehearse the story of antique citadels. Keenly we unearth the false-
