<p>But if haply you imagine that the winds run down the same passage as that by which they are expelled and return, Aetna’s own region will give your eyes facts for their notice and so compel denial.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_391_aa" id="target_note_LCL284_391_aa">

</a> However brilliant the atmosphere, however rainless under the blue sky, though the dawn rise with golden beams and blush with crimson tint, yet in that quarter there is always a cloud of impenetrable gloom and of slow movement that hangs lumpishly around, moist in its showery countenance, looking forth from its height on the mountain’s state<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_391_b" id="target_note_LCL284_391_b">

</a> and its vast recesses. Aetna ignores it and never dislodges it with any discharge of heat; wherever the bidding of a light breeze sends it, the cloud obeys, but then comes back. Further, look for yourself at worshippers who on the highest spur, just where there gapes open the freest view of the mountain’s interior—source
of such mighty upheavals—propitiate with incense the deities of heaven, provided nothing arouses the flames and the abyss remains in stupor. Do you then accept this as proving how that rushing volcanic “spirit,” the whirler of crags and soil, the darter of fires, is, when once it has controlled its powers and put a sudden check on the reins, never known to pluck asunder bodies of matter or dislodge them from their strong arch, even though by their

This passage aims at disproving the idea that the wind which in an eruption issues from the crater has been constantly entering the mountain by the same avenue. Two arguments refute the notion: (1) the cloud which hangs invariably over the summit would be displaced by any wind passing down the crater; (2) the custom of worshippers to assemble at the crater and there offer incense would be impossible, if there were powerful winds blowing into the mountain. This, then, is ocular evidence of calm against any theory that winds from without cause volcanic explosions.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL284_391_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL284_391_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL284_391_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>
