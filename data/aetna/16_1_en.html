your belief that winds rise from other causes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_389_aa" id="target_note_LCL284_389_aa">

</a> It is undoubted (I claim) that there are rocks and caverns far below which fall forward with enormous crash, and that their fall disperses and sets in motion air-currents
hard by: hence the gathering of winds. Again, fogs with their ample vapour pour out air, as they commonly do in plains and fields watered by a river. Rising from valleys the air makes a sombre cloud: rivulets bring gusts whose force is like the force of winds. Moisture from a distance breathes on the air-currents and whips them into strength. And, if a free space lets moisture have such power, its effects must be greater in proportion when within confined limits underground. These are the causes above and below ground which are at work. By compression they rouse the winds; they strive in narrow gorges; in that close strife their channel strangles them. As when a wave, drawn up again and again from the deep, has drunk full of the East Wind’s violence, the billows redouble their number and the first are pushed on by the last, in that same way the (volcanic) wind feels the impact of the struggle which compresses it, wraps its own strength within its heavy mass and impels its close-packed particles through fiery passages. Wherever a path is found, it speeds on, ignoring any wind that would stay its course, until, driven by the confluent air-stream,
as by so many forcing-pumps,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_389_b" id="target_note_LCL284_389_b">

</a> it leaps forth and all over Aetna discharges itself in blasts of angry fire.</p>

The reasoning takes the form of an answer to a possible objector who suggests that there may be causes for winds in Aetna other than those already set forth (283–306). The argument is that you must allow that rock-falls underground generate air-currents; and, just as river vapours in valleys emit air (more perceptibly in hot climates, Munro says here; <span class="italic">cf</span>. also Lucret. VI. 476 <span class="italic">sqq.</span>), so the effect of moisture (<span class="italic">cf.</span>
