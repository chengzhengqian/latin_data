its characteristics, and fire has not ruined its look. Moreover, the very constancy of its colour, not its smell or lightness, disproves any foreign elements.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_409_aa" id="target_note_LCL284_409_aa">

</a> The stone crumbles more and more, but its mode of working has the same look and the earth therein is unchanged throughout. I do not, however, deny that specific stones take fire and when kindled burn fiercely within. It is a quality proper to them. The Sicilians have given those very stones a name, <span class="italic">rhytae,</span> and by the title itself record that they are of a fusible character.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_409_b" id="target_note_LCL284_409_b">

</a> Yet although these stones have a somewhat juicy substance to preserve heat within, they never liquefy unless they have been brought deeply into touch with the pores of the lava-stone. But if anyone wonders that the core of stone can be fused, let him ponder those truest of sayings in thy mysterious book, O Heraclitus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_409_c" id="target_note_LCL284_409_c">

</a> “naught is unconquerable by fire, in which all the seeds of the universe are sown.” But is this too great a marvel? Bodies of thickest grain and well-nigh solid we nevertheless often subdue by fire. Do you not see how copper’s sturdy spirit yields to flame? Does not fire strip away the toughness of lead? Even iron’s substance, hard though it be, is yet undone by fire. Massive nuggets of gold sweat out their rich ore in vaulted furnaces; and mayhap there lie in the depths of earth undiscovered
