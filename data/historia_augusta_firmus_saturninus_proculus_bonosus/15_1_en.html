<p>The list of gifts was as follows: “Violet tunics of part-silk provided with hoods, one tunic of part-silk with a golden stripe, to weigh a pound, two double-striped under-tunics, and all the other things that are befitting a matron. To Bonosus himself you will give one hundred Philips of gold, one thousand silver Antonines, and ten thousand bronze sesterces.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_415_1" id="target_note_LCL263_415_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>This is what I remember having read about Bonosus. I might, indeed, have omitted the lives of these men, concerning whom no one has ever inquired, but, in order that there may be no lack of accuracy, I have taken care to make known what I have learned about these also. There still remain for me Carus, Carinus and Numerian; for Diocletian and those who came after him must be described in a grander style.</p>
