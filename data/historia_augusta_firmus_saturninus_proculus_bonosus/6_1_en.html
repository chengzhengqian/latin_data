found out concerning Firmus, all, however, that is worthy of mention. For as to what Aurelius Festivus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_397_1" id="target_note_LCL263_397_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Aurelian’s freedman, has reported about him in detail, if you wish to learn it, you should read him yourself, most of all the passage which tells how this same Firmus went swimming among the crocodiles when rubbed with crocodiles’ fat, how he drove an elephant and mounted a hippopotamus and rode about sitting upon huge ostriches, so that he seemed to be flying. But what avails it to know all this, especially as both Livy and Sallust are silent in regard to trivial matters concerning those men on whose biographies they have laid hold? For instance, we do not know of what breed were the mules of Clodius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_397_2" id="target_note_LCL263_397_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or the she-mules of Titus Annius Milo, or whether the horse that Catiline rode was a Tuscan or a Sardinian, or what kind of purple Pompey used for his cloak. Therefore we will make an end of Firmus and pass on to Saturninus,
who seized the imperial power in the regions of the East in opposition to Probus.</p>
