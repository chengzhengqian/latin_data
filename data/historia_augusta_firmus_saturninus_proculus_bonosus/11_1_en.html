<p>XII. Proculus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_407_1" id="target_note_LCL263_407_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was a native of Albingauni,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_407_2" id="target_note_LCL263_407_2"><sup>2</sup></a> situated in the Maritime Alps. He was a nobleman in his native place, but his ancestors had been brigands, and thus he was very rich in cattle and slaves and all that they had carried away. In fact, it is said that at the time when he seized the imperial power he armed two thousand slaves of his own. His wife, who drove him to this act of madness, was a masculine woman called Samso—though this name was given her in her later years, for originally she was called Vituriga. His son was Herennianus, whom also he would have dedicated to the imperial office—for that was his way of speaking—had he but completed his fifth year. The man himself, it cannot be denied, was . . . and at the same time most valiant; though accustomed also to brigandage, he yet lived his whole life in arms, for he commanded many legions as tribune and did courageous deeds. And now, since all the most trivial things are interesting and bring some pleasure when they are read, I must not fail to mention an incident of which he himself boasts in one of his letters, deeming it better to quote the letter itself rather than to speak about it at length.</p>
<p>“From Proculus to his kinsman Maecianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_407_3" id="target_note_LCL263_407_3"><sup>3</sup></a> greeting. I have taken one hundred maidens from Sarmatia.
Of these I mated with ten in a single night; all of them, however, I made into women, as far as was in my power, in the space of fifteen days.”</p>
<p>He boasts, as you see, of a foolish and a very licentious deed, thinking that he would be held a brave
