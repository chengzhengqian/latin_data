For all the regular coinage the chief mint was at Rome, except
perhaps for quinarii and victoriates; but there were local
Roman mints in South Italy, in Spain, and possibly in Sicily.</p>
<p>The gold described above being temporary issues, the
<span class="italic">denarius</span> and its parts and the <span class="italic">as</span> and its parts remained as the
Roman coinage proper, though the victoriate (ousted largely
by the quinarius) survived, perhaps merely as a commodity to
help trade. Independent Italian currency tends to lapse.
The denarius is supreme. For some time fresh issues of
<span class="italic">quinarii</span> and <span class="italic">sestertii</span> ceased; issues of the former were renewed
at intervals under the terms of a <span class="italic">Lex Clodia</span> of unknown date
(<span class="italic">c.</span> 113–101? perhaps 104 <span class="sc">b.c</span>), with a new tariff of 8 <span class="italic">asses</span>
each, the coins being marked not V as before but Q, and
bearing the type and receiving the name of the old victoriati
(cf. Pliny, xxxiii, 3, 13); issues of the <span class="italic">sestertii</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_220_1" id="target_note_LCL359_220_1"><sup>1</sup></a> were renewed
for a time under the terms of the <span class="italic">Lex Papiria semunciaria</span>
(or <span class="italic">de asse semunciali</span> or <span class="italic">de aere publico</span>) passed in 89 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> This
law also reduced the as to half an ounce— 1/24 of its original
weight,—and suppressed local mints in Italy, especially those
which had been created by the rebels during the ‘Social’
War (91–88 <span class="sc">b.c</span>). Issues of fresh bronze ceased after 86 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>
(except outside Rome by generals in the provinces) until
15 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>; so also did issues of silver except the denarius. After
88 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> Sulla issued in the East on his own authority the first
gold <span class="italic">aurei,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_220_2" id="target_note_LCL359_220_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but such gold coinage was not official until Julius
Caesar after 50 <span class="sc">b.c</span> made a proper gold coinage of aurei and
half aurei struck at Rome. However, with this and the
important subject of the Roman coinage of the imperial
period we are not concerned. Of non-Roman Italian coinage
of the Republican period we need say little, important though
it was. Not only states having no fixed bonds with Rome
could and did make independent coins, but also the Roman
‘allies’ of various degrees, including the Latin colonies, of
which two examples are mentioned below. After the war
(281–275 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) with Pyrrhus, Roman coinage began to predominate, and gradually superseded the other coinages in
Italy.</p>
