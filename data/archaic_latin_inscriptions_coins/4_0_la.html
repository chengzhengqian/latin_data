<p>Anyhow, round about 100 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> the office appears as a minor
and doubtless year-long and yearly elective Roman magistracy,
held usually before the quaestorship. With a few possible
exceptions, the name of only one triumvir appears on any
coin; the triumvirs coin not as a Board but individually
when called on by the Senate, so that, although these were
elected, there was normally nothing for any of them to do, and
even when issues were made, two were normally idle. In the
latter part of the Republic the <span class="italic">quaestores urbani</span> also, who
controlled the treasury (<span class="italic">aerarium Saturni</span>), and so in a way
had an eye on the coinage, could perhaps take an administrative part in the actual striking and issue of coins.
At any rate they had charge of the state’s bullion (from which, instead
of the market’s bullion, coins were sometimes struck) and
received the money from the triumvirs so that they could
use it for state-purposes. Outside Italy the issues were
probably in the hands of the provincial quaestors alone. But
when a quaestor’s name and magistracy appears on the actual
coins, then the issue was for a special purpose (see below).
There is probably no exception to this rule. Thus the Board
of Three were the normal moneyers of the coinage, whose
names might appear on the coins, though sometimes other
magistrates were allowed by the senate to coin or to put their
names on coins. During the latter part of the Republic, when
most of the coins given below were issued, there were really two
kinds of coinage, the coinage minted in Rome, and the coinage
minted in the provinces. For there were mints at places other
than Rome; but all permanent mints, both in Italy and the
provinces, were, like the mint at Rome itself, controlled by
the Senate. However, there was a good deal of provincial
minting (of special issues), some of which was perhaps only
nominally within the Senate’s control, while some was quite
outside it, being the work of powerful Roman generals—proconsuls or <span class="italic">imperatores</span>—each acting by virtue of his own
military authority and usually bearing his name with or
without the name of a military moneyer or coin-striker
subordinate to him. This tendency is especially clear from
Sulla’s time onwards, and is one sign of loss of senatorial
control in the provinces—a loss fateful for the Republic.</p>
<p>Four further points should be noted with regard to the
coins given below:—(i) When a moneyer is mentioned (usually
one only is mentioned) on a coin and he is not designated as
