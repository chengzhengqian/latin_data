<p>Inscriptions on coins are generally treated as part of
Numismatics, but they are nevertheless apart of Epigraphy also,
and their inscriptions are naturally to be classed among the <span class="italic">tituli</span>
on <span class="italic">instrumentum.</span> Of Roman coins of the Republic which are to
be dated before 79 <span class="sc">b.c,</span> or show archaisms, I have given below a
very few; the inscriptions occurring on these, being in some
sense at least translatable, do form a part of Latinity. In the
left margin of the Latin pages, I have given references to
<span class="italic">C.I.L.,</span> I, 2, (2,) <span class="italic">appendix nummorum,</span> pp. 741 ff., and in the
right margin of the English pages, I have given references to
pages of the <span class="italic">B.M. Catalogue,</span> that is, <span class="italic">Coins of the Roman
Republic</span> in the British Museum, Vols. I–III (H. A. Grueber,
1910). But it must be remembered not only that much work
has been done since that catalogue was issued, but also that
recently the establishment of a later date for the first institution
of <span class="italic">denarii</span> by Rome, and other considerations (cf. H. Mattingly
and E. S. G. Robinson, ‘The date of the Roman denarius and
other landmarks in early Roman coinage,’ <span class="italic">Proc. Brit. Acad.,</span>
XVIII, 1932, and other work cited below, p. 218) have put
much of the results of earlier work out of date in two senses.</p>
<p>Among the very early Latins and Romans the most primitive
form of exchange—by barter of anything for anything,
especially cattle (<span class="italic">pecus,</span> whence comes <span class="italic">pecunia</span>)—was followed
first by the use of lumps of impure copper, unshaped or of
various shapes, and of undefined or vaguely fixed weights,
then by the use of an exchange-unit in the form of a foot-long
cast rod or bar (<span class="italic">as</span> probably = <span class="italic">asser, assula</span>), at first of copper,
then of bronze as an alloy of copper and tin with a little lead.
This was at first unmarked (<span class="italic">aes rude</span> or <span class="italic">infectum</span>), but was
soon, in the casting, stamped, perhaps unofficially, with the
figure of an ox, then later with other types. In this system
(which modern scholars call <span class="italic">aes signatum</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_216_1a" id="target_note_LCL359_216_1a"><sup>1</sup></a>) the foot-length
went out of use, the weight alone—usually 4–5 pounds—counting, the shape becoming that of oblong or quadrilateral

It would be better to give these stamped bricks the name <span class="italic">aes grave signatum</span>, and to call the later bronze coinage of Periods (i) and (ii), as described below, <span class="italic">aes librale signatum</span> or something like that.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL359_216_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
