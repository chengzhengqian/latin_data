being any magistrate, he is nearly always <span class="italic">triumvir aere argento auro flando feriundo</span> and is making a normal issue at the senate’s request. Coins issued by administrative persons other than such triumvirs, and not necessarily bearing only one person’s name, are a feature of the last century of the Republic; and such coins were issued by decree of the senate acting on its own discretion, in the name or names of more ordinary (that is, not triumviral) magistrates, usually quaestors or curule aediles, for a special purpose other than mere striking, one falling within the ordinary authority of the magistrates. Every moneyer had to be a magistrate, and, whatever the office attributed to the person’s name on a coin, that person is in some sense at least a moneyer. It is generally held that no triumvir of the mint could make a special issue. I think that in exceptional cases he could; see note on p. 238. (ii) The special nature of special issues was further indicated, for purposes of commemoration, in various ways on the coins. Thus <span class="italic">s. c.</span> (<span class="italic">senatus consulto</span>) or <span class="italic">e</span>(<span class="italic">x</span>) <span class="italic">s. c.</span> and <span class="italic">d. s. s.</span> (<span class="italic">de senatus sententia</span>) means by official order of the senate—the former expression, ‘by decree,’ implying perhaps an express command, the latter, ‘by vote,’ perhaps implying a decree involving other matters also. The signs occur only in the last century of the Republic, and refer to special issues by special moneyers for Rome, Italy and the provinces. Again, the expressions <span class="italic">ex. a. p.</span> or <span class="italic">p. a.</span> (<span class="italic">ex argento publico</span>) ‘from silver of the state’ and perhaps<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_223_1" id="target_note_LCL359_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at times <span class="italic">d. a. p.</span> (<span class="italic">de aere publico</span>) ‘from bronze of the state’ and also <span class="italic">d. t.</span> (which Mommsen takes to mean <span class="italic">de thesauro</span> ‘from the treasury’) and <span class="italic">p</span>. (<span class="italic">publice</span> ‘officially’) give the source, that is, the bullion of the public treasury, from which the particular issue was struck, such issues being in fact for an emergency, for all our examples belong to the period of the Cimbric Wars (113–101 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) and the ‘Social’ War (91–88 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>). The bullion for ordinary issues was provided from the ordinary market; and the coins of such ordinary issues (as distinct from special issues), though of course coming officially from the state, bear none of the signs mentioned in (ii) above, (iii) The expression <span class="italic">l. P</span>. (<span class="italic">lege Papiria</span> ‘by the Papirian law’) indicates a special issue by the senate but fulfilling the requirements of a people’s law—in this case the Papirian, for which see pp. 220, 232—ordaining a change in
