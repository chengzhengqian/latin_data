I suggest that the second coin was struck a little later than the preceding; that he had made an issue as special moneyer when he was quaestor (see preceding coin), and when he became triumvir of the mint, as such made a new special issue, and was allowed to designate himself as mint-manager to distinguish this act from the issue which he made as quaestor. Had his issue as triumvir preceded his issue as quaestor, no designation as <span class="italic">curator</span> would have appeared on that first issue. If this is correct, the second issue at least was struck in Rome, not in Spain. However, the assumption that here <span class="italic">curator</span> means <span class="italic">triumvir</span> may be wrong. Yet any moneyer had to be a magistrate of some sort. If this <span class="italic">curator</span> was not a triumvir, what magistracy did he hold? There is no reason why triumvirs should have been excluded from making special issues. <span class="italic">flare</span> ‚Äòcast‚Äô; but all coins were now struck‚Äîsee pp. 219, 221.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL359_239_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL359_239_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL359_239_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>The reverse has a view of the Basilica Aemilia with shields attached to the columns.
