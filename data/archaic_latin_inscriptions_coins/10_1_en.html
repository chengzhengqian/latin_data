This coin was probably among those coined (largely from plundered temple-treasuries of Greece) at Sulla’s orders by his quaestor Lucullus in the Peloponnese (Plut., <span class="italic">Lucull.,</span> 2) after the war; others (see below) were coined in Asia Minor (<span class="italic">id.,</span> 4) from the 20,000 talents levied on the cities of Asia Minor by Sulla. The trophies refer probably to the battles of Chaeroneia (86 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) and Orchomenos (85 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) over Archelaus, general of Mithridates.
Sulla, was hailed ‘general’ by his troops first perhaps during the ‘Social’ War or after the Cilician campaign of 92 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, and next probably after the battle of Orchomenos. As regards the obverse of this coin, Sulla thought he was under the protection of Venus who gave him victory in war as well as in love.
