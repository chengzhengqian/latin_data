<p>bricks (<span class="italic">lateres</span>). Bars or bricks thus marked were used well into the third century <span class="sc">b.c.</span> Such pieces were not coins, unless the stamping and issue of <span class="italic">aes signatum</span> was in fact official, and unless the pieces were also really used as money. Institution of a real coinage by Rome came late as compared with other Mediterranean races; but, once it began, the main developments took place within about a century and a quarter. The dates at which modern scholars place the institution and successive changes in real Roman coinage must lack precision, for the early literary tradition about its institution is mythical, and the literary records of the changes are inaccurate; but the following scheme is now winning wide acceptance.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Period</span> (<span class="italic">i</span>). <span class="italic">c</span>. 289 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> (or later)—269 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> at least. Tradition (Pomponius, in <span class="italic">Dig.</span>, I, 2, 2, 30) seems to assign the institution of the triumvirate of the mint (see below) at Rome to 289 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, and the surviving early coins point to a period going back not earlier than about 290 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> These coins (<span class="italic">aes grave</span>) are a heavy round lenticular cast bronze <span class="italic">as</span> of rather less than a pound in weight (<span class="italic">as libralis</span>), and its parts—<span class="italic">semis</span> (½), <span class="italic">triens</span> (⅓), <span class="italic">quadrans</span> (¼), <span class="italic">sextans</span> (⅙), and <span class="italic">uncia</span> (‘ounce,’ 1/12); the values being marked on the coins as I, S, and the following dots:—. . . . (= 4 <span class="italic">unciae</span> = ⅓ <span class="italic">as</span> = <span class="italic">triens</span>), . . ., . ., and . respectively. Multiples of the <span class="italic">as</span>—the <span class="italic">dupondius</span> ‘2 pound piece’ of 2 <span class="italic">asses</span>, the <span class="italic">tripondius</span> or <span class="italic">tressis</span> of 3 <span class="italic">asses</span>, and probably also the <span class="italic">decussis</span> of 10 <span class="italic">asses</span>—were likewise made, by casting, at this period. Bricks of the older kind (see above) were issued till at least 279 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> They would be used, as indicated above, not as coins, but, for instance, in the ceremony of formal transfer <span class="italic">per aes et libram</span>; for which, see <span class="italic">Remains of Old Latin</span>, III, pp. 428–9. There was as yet no silver or gold coined by Rome, though she already used ingots and foreign coins of these metals.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Period</span> (<span class="italic">ii</span>). <span class="italic">c</span>. 268—<span class="italic">c</span>. 235 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> The bronze described above was still issued but was supplemented by the first issue
