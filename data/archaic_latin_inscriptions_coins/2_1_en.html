‘tenpiece’ of 10 <span class="italic">asses</span>, with the value-mark X = figure 10. During the Gracchan period (133–122 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_219_3" id="target_note_LCL359_219_3"><sup>3</sup></a> the tariff was raised to 16 <span class="italic">asses</span> to the denarius. A few denarii exist with XVI on them—they were all issued probably at the time of the tariff change—but the prevailing sign of value becomes 𐆖 which is not apparently a monogram of XVI (though many a Roman user may have thought so) but letter X deleted to show a value-mark (cp. 𐆘 or ||S in the case of the sestertius, dealt with below).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_219_4" id="target_note_LCL359_219_4"><sup>4</sup></a> The plain sign X was still used, in the end probably only on denarii from other mints than that at Rome, and on coins for the use of provinces. Anyhow, the name of the coin is always denarius, and in the end after 76 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> both signs disappear, (<span class="italic">b</span>) Another denomination of the new coinage was the (<span class="italic">nummus</span>) <span class="italic">quinarius</span> of 5 asses, marked V ‘five’ (very rarely Q—see below, p. 220). (<span class="italic">c</span>) The lowest denomination of the new silver was the (<span class="italic">nummus</span>) <span class="italic">sestertius</span> of 2 1/2 asses (<span class="italic">sestertius</span> = <span class="italic">semis tertius</span>, which means either: ‘the third piece [<span class="italic">as</span>-unit] is only half’ = 2 1/2; or perhaps: ‘the third half-unit,’ the first half being 1/2, the second being 1 1/2), later of 4 asses, and marked ||S (<span class="italic">duo et semis</span> ‘two and a half’). After 187 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> the as was reduced to two ounces—the ‘sextantal’ standard; the <span class="italic">dodrans</span> (3/4 <span class="italic">as</span>) and the <span class="italic">bes</span> (2/3 <span class="italic">as</span>) appeared for a short time, perhaps during the Gracchan period; and subdivisions of the <span class="italic">uncia</span> were introduced. The bronze coinage was more or less dependent on the silver, and tended to be more or less token-money. Lastly, there was a new gold issue: (<span class="italic">a</span>) pieces with head of Mars, of scruples 3, 2, and 1—60, 40 and 20 <span class="italic">sestertii</span> (or <span class="italic">asses?</span>) and marked accordingly LX, XXXX, XX respectively; (<span class="italic">b</span>) (at a later date) with head of Janus a piece<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_219_5" id="target_note_LCL359_219_5"><sup>5</sup></a> of 4 scruples and marked XXX (30 victoriates?). All coins were now struck, not cast.</p>
