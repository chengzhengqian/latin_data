<p>With regard particularly to the coins given below, the following points should be noted. Roman coins of the Republic were never issued by Roman families (as has been popularly believed); nor could individual magistrates issue coins legally on their own authority alone, though some did. The proper coinage was made and issued by the state, and during the republic was controlled by the Roman Senate through Roman officials; but if any change of system (of weight, metal, and even to some extent the types) was undertaken, the whole people passed a law accordingly under which the Senate then made its issues. There is no real certainty about the place or places of minting in Rome. The mint for bronze may well have been at the temple of Saturn, while the mint known to have been at the temple of Juno Moneta (whose name <span class="italic">Moneta</span>,—meaning according to the Romans ‘Adviser,’ from <span class="italic">moneo</span>—was given to this mint and later to all money) was perhaps for silver only. Again there is no certainty as to who were the regular casters or strikers of coins for any regular issues until the first century <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, but it appears probable that from the beginning or at any rate from an early period<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_221_3" id="target_note_LCL359_221_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of the real coinage of Rome the making and issue was normally directed by administrative officials called <span class="italic">Triumviri</span> or <span class="italic">Tresviri monetales</span> ‘Board of Three of the Mint,’ and, as late inscriptions and coins (not before 72 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) show, <span class="italic">Triumviri</span> or <span class="italic">Tresviri aere argento auro flando feriundo</span> ‘Board of Three for casting and striking bronze silver and gold.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_221_4" id="target_note_LCL359_221_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Tradition seems<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_221_5" id="target_note_LCL359_221_5"><sup>5</sup></a> to put their first creation in 289 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> On extant coins they first appear (at first as symbols, then monograms, initials, or abbreviations, then generally full name) on the ‘sextantal’ bronze, that is, after 188 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> (see above), though not on the earliest of this period, the signature guaranteeing the legality of the issue. They do not appear on the earliest gold nor on the earliest <span class="italic">denarii, quinarii</span>, and <span class="italic">sestertii</span>, but before long they appear on all coins as a rule, though there were some issues without moneyer’s names. For a long time perhaps the triumviri were appointed only when issues of money were needed.
