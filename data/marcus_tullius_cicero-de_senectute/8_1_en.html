Maximus? Because you surely realize now that it would be monstrous to call unhappy such an old age as his. And yet, not every one can be a Scipio or a Maximus and call to mind the cities he has taken, the battles he has fought on land and sea, the campaigns he has conducted, and the triumphs he has won. But there is also the tranquil and serene old age of a life spent quietly, amid pure and refining pursuits—such an old age, for example, as we are told was that of Plato, who died, pen in hand,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_23_1" id="target_note_LCL154_23_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in his eighty-first year; such as that of Isocrates, who, by his own statement, was ninetyfour when he composed the work entitled <span class="italic">Panathenaicus,</span> and he lived five years after that. His teacher, Gorgias of Leontini, rounded out one hundred and seven years and never rested from his pursuits or his labours. When some one asked him why he chose to remain so long alive, he answered : “I have no reason to reproach old age.” A noble answer and worthy of a scholar!</p>
<p>For, in truth, it is their own vices and their own faults that fools charge to old age; but Ennius, of whom I spoke a while ago, did not do this, for he says :</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">He, like the gallant steed that often won</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Olympic trophy in the final lap,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Now takes his rest when weakened by old age.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>He is comparing his old age to that of a brave and victorious horse. You both may recall him distinctly,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_23_2" id="target_note_LCL154_23_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for it was only nineteen years from his death until the election of the present consuls, Titus Flamininus and Manius Acilius, and he did not pass away until the consulship of Caepio and Philip (the latter being in his second term), at a time when I, at sixty-five, spoke publicly for the Voconian
