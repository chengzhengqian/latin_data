<span class="line">And wring thy heart and torture thee with pain,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>For, my dear Atticus, I may fitly speak to you in these self-same lines in which,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent5">That man</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Of little wealth, but rich in loyalty</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">speaks to Flamininus. And yet I am perfectly sure that it cannot be said of you, as the poet said of Flamininus,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">You fret and worry, Titus, day and night,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">for I know your self-control and the even temper of your mind, and I am aware that you brought home from Athens not only a cognomen but culture and practical wisdom too. Nevertheless I suspect that you, at times, are quite seriously perturbed by the same circumstances <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_9_2" id="target_note_LCL154_9_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which are troubling me; but to find comfort for them is too difficult a task to be undertaken now and must be deferred until another time.</p>
