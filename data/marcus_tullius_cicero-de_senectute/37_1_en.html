dearest son, and to you, Scipio, by the untimely end of your two brothers, when they were giving promise of attaining to the highest honours in the State. But, you may say, the young man hopes that he will live for a long time and this hope the old man cannot have. Such a hope is not wise, for what is more unwise than to mistake uncertainty for certainty, falsehood for truth? They say, also, that the old man has nothing even to hope for. Yet he is in better case than the young man, since what the latter merely hopes for, the former has already attained; the one wishes to live long, the other has lived long.</p>
<p>But, ye gods! what is there in human nature that is for long? For grant the utmost limit of Life; let us hope to reach the age of the Tartessian king—for at Cadiz there was, as I have seen it recorded,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_81_1" id="target_note_LCL154_81_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a certain Arganthonius, who had reigned eighty and had lived one hundred and twenty years—, but to me nothing whatever seems “lengthy” if it has an end; for when that end arrives, then that which was is gone; naught remains but the fruit of good and virtuous deeds. Hours and days, and months and years, go by; the past returns no more, and what is to be we cannot know; but whatever the time given us in which to live, we should therewith be content.</p>
<p>The actor, for instance, to please his audience need not appear in every act to the very end; it is enough if he is approved in the parts in which he plays; and so it is not necessary for the wise man to stay on this mortal stage to the last fall of the curtain.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_81_2" id="target_note_LCL154_81_2"><sup>2</sup></a> For even if the allotted space of life be short, it is long enough in which to live honourably
