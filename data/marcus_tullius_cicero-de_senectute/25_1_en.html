the pleasure of meeting and conversing with my friends. For our fathers did well in calling the reclining of friends at feasts a <span class="italic">convivium,</span> because it implies a communion of life, which is a better designation than that of the Greeks, who call it sometimes a “drinking together” and sometimes an “eating together,” <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_57_1" id="target_note_LCL154_57_1"><sup>1</sup></a> thereby apparently exalting what is of least value in these associations above that which gives them their greatest charm.</p>

<p>XIV. For my own part, because of my love of conversation, I enjoy even “afternoon banquets,” <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_57_2" id="target_note_LCL154_57_2"><sup>2</sup></a> not with my contemporaries only, very few of whom now remain, but also with you and with those of your age; and I am profoundly grateful to old age, which has increased my eagerness for conversation and taken away that for food and drink. But if there are any who find delight in such things (that I may by no means seem to have declared war on every kind of pleasure, when, perhaps, a certain amount of it is justified by nature), then I may say that I am not aware that old age is altogether wanting in appreciation even of these very pleasures. Indeed I find delight in the custom established by our forefathers of appointing presidents <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_57_3" id="target_note_LCL154_57_3"><sup>3</sup></a> at such gatherings; and in the talk, which, after that ancestral custom, begins at the head of the table when the wine comes in; and I enjoy cups, like those described in Xenophon’s <span class="italic">Symposium</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_57_4" id="target_note_LCL154_57_4"><sup>4</sup></a> that are small in size, filled with dew-like drops, cooled in summer, and, again, in winter, warmed by the heat of sun or fire. Even when among the Sabines <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_57_5" id="target_note_LCL154_57_5"><sup>5</sup></a> I keep up the practice of frequenting such gatherings, and every day I join my neighbours in a social meal which we protract as late as we can into the night with talk on varying themes.</p>
