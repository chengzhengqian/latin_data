tyrant Pisistratus who asked, “Pray, what do you rely upon in opposing me so boldly?” and Solon replied, “Old age.” But the most desirable end of life is that which comes while the mind is clear and the faculties are unimpaired, when Nature herself takes apart the work which she has put together. As the builder most readily destroys the ship or the house which he has built, so Nature is the agent best fitted to give dissolution to her creature, man. Now every structure when newly built is hard to pull apart, but the old and weather-beaten house comes easily down.</p>
<p>Hence, it follows that old men ought neither to cling too fondly to their little remnant of life, nor give it up without a cause. Pythagoras<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_85_1" id="target_note_LCL154_85_1"><sup>1</sup></a> bids us stand like faithful sentries and not quit our post until God, our Captain, gives the word. Solon the Wise has a couplet in which he says that he does not want his death to be free from the grief and mourning of his friends.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_85_2" id="target_note_LCL154_85_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He wishes, no doubt to make out that he is dear to his friends, but I am inclined to think that Ennius has expressed it better when he says :</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">I do not wish the honour of a tear,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or any wailing cries about my bier.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">He does not think that death, which is followed by eternal life, should be a cause of grief.</p>
<p>Now, there may be some sensation in the process of dying, but it is a fleeting one, especially to the old; after death the sensation is either pleasant or there is none at all. But this should be thought on from our youth up, so that we may be indifferent to death,
