For where else can the old man find more genial warmth of sun or fire, and, on the other hand, where, in summer time, can he more healthfully cool himself with shade and running streams? Let others, then, have their weapons, their horses and their spears, their fencing-foils, and games of ball, their swimming contests and foot-races, and out of many sports leave us old fellows our dice and knuckle-bones. Or take away the dice-box, too, if you will, since old age can be happy without it.</p>

<p>XVII. Xenophon’s writings are very instructive on many subjects and I beg you to go on reading them with studious care. With what copious eloquence agriculture is lauded in his book entitled <span class="italic">The Householder,</span> which treats of the management of estates! To show you that Xenophon regarded nothing more befitting royalty than zeal in husbandry, let me recall the incident<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_71_1" id="target_note_LCL154_71_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in the same book, related by Socrates in a conversation with Critobulus.
