<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">theo</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I say that you’ve led my son astray.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">tra</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Just listen. I admit that he’s strayed, that he’s freed his
girlfriend in your absence, and that he’s borrowed money<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1140</span><span class="br"></span>
on interest. I’m telling you that it’s all been spent. Has he
done anything other than what the sons of the best families
do?</p></div>

people of your age, who have a hoary head, ought to have
more sense.</p></div>
