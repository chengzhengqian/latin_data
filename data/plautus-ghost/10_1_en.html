today I’ll give you . . . something or other and I won’t let<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">175</span><span class="br"></span>
you have praised the girl I love without reward.</p></div>

run down undeservedly to being praised deservedly?
I for one prefer to be complimented, even if undeservedly,

laugh about my appearance.</p></div>

what I promised you as a gift.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sca</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">You’re indeed making a mistake by waiting on him alone,
showing him your special favor like this, and despising
others. It’s appropriate for a married woman, not for a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">190</span><span class="br"></span>
