<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sca</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Because a woman smells right when she doesn’t smell of
anything: as for those old women who apply ointments,
furbishing themselves up, toothless crones who conceal<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">275</span><span class="br"></span>
their poor physical shape with makeup, when their sweat
mingles with the ointments, they instantly smell the same
way as when a cook mixes many sauces together. What
they smell of you can’t tell, except for this one thing: you
know they smell bad.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">philo</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">How cleverly she knows everything! Nothing’s cleverer
than this clever one. That’s true; and most of you know it,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">280</span><span class="br"></span>
you who have old women as wives at home, who bought
you with their dowries.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">phile</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Go on, look if the jewelry and gown suit me well
enough, Scapha.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sca</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I shouldn’t be the one to care about that.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">phile</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Who, then, should, please?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sca</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I’ll tell you: Philolaches, so that he doesn’t buy anything<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">285</span><span class="br"></span>
except what he thinks he’ll like. [Yes, a lover buys a prostitute’s
favors with jewelry and purple-dyed clothes.]
What’s the point of showing him unasked what he doesn’t
want to be his? Purple is there for concealing old
age, jewelry for concealing an ugly woman. A beautiful
woman will be more beautiful naked than dressed in purple.
[What’s more, if a woman has a bad character she’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">290</span><span class="br"></span>
adorned for nothing. An ugly character besmirches beautiful
adornment worse than dung.] Yes, if she’s beautiful
she’s adorned more than enough.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">philo</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">It’s high time to go and address them. (<span class="italic">advancing</span>) What
are you two doing here?</p></div>
