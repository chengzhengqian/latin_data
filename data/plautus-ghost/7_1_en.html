and careless man moves in there, a slovenly slacker,
together with a lazy household, then the house gets damaged,
being a good house but badly looked after. And that
sort of thing happens a lot: a storm comes and breaks all
the tiles; then the careless owner doesn’t want to replace<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">110</span><span class="br"></span>
them. Rain comes and soaks the walls; they let in water;
the rain rots the timbers and destroys the builder’s work.
The utility of the house has already been diminished.
And this is not the builder’s fault, but most people have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">115</span><span class="br"></span>

they keep waiting and don’t do it until the walls come

the builders. When one campaign has been served, then
one can see an example of how the building is to turn out.
