in cold water and haven’t had a more thorough scouring,
I should think, my dear Scapha.</p></div>

been a huge harvest this year.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">160</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>

away the roof of all my modesty, the roof that I was covered
with, when Love and Passion rained into my breast,
and I can’t reroof myself ever again: the walls in my heart<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">165</span><span class="br"></span>
are already soaked, this house is utterly destroyed.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">phile</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Look me over, please, my dear Scapha, to see if this
dress suits me nicely. I want to please Philolaches, my
darling and my patron.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">sca</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Why don’t you adorn yourself with pretty ways, since you
are pretty yourself? Lovers don’t love a woman’s dress,
but its stuffing.</p></div>

knows a lot, the hussy. In what a lovely way she understands
all the ways and sentiments of lovers!</p></div>
