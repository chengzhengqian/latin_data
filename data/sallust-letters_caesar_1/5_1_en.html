Domitius Ahenobarbus (son-in-law of Cinna, cos. 87–84) in 81 at Utica, in the African campaign (see ibid. 1.46)—both in the Sullan civil war; M. Iunius Brutus (father of Caesar’s famous assassin) after the surrender of Mutina in Cisalpine Gaul in 77 (see ibid. 1.69), at the time of the Lepidan revolt against Sulla’s regime. Among those designated here by “others as well” is M. Perperna (pr. 82), whom Val. Max. 6.2.8 adds to the three named victims.

Presumably the author means that the ever-present fear that Pompey and his supporters might renew those grim acts of revenge was finally put to rest both by the removal of Pompey, the perpetrator of the killings enumerated in 4.1, and by Caesar’s enlightened policy of pardoning his defeated enemies.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL522_487_15').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL522_487_16"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL522_487_16" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">16</sup>I.e., political figures who switched allegiance after Caesar’s victory over Pompey.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL522_487_16').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
