with what great diligence is it fitting for achievements of prowess, as well as material creations, to be maintained so that they may not be spoiled by neglect or be weakened and fall in ruin. For no one willingly yields power to another; and however virtuous and merciful a person may be who has more power, he is nevertheless feared because there is nothing to stop him from being bad. This happens because most people in charge of affairs reason incorrectly and think themselves to be the more secure, the greater the worthlessness of those over whom they exercise authority.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_481_4" id="target_note_LCL522_481_4"><sup>4</sup></a> But on the contrary, since you yourself are virtuous and valiant, it is fitting for you to aim to exercise authority over the best possible subjects. For the worse a person is, the less inclined he is to put up with control.</p>
<p>But it is a heavier task for you than for all before you to set in order your conquests because you waged war with greater gentleness than others exercise in time of peace. In addition, the victors<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_481_5" id="target_note_LCL522_481_5"><sup>5</sup></a> are demanding booty, while the vanquished are our fellow citizens. Amid these difficulties, you must find your way clear and strengthen the nation for the future, not only by arms and against foreign foes, but also by means of the fine arts of peace, a task far, far thornier. Therefore, the situation calls upon all men, those of great or moderate wisdom, to offer you the best advice each person is capable of giving. And this is my view: in whatever way you solidify your victory, so will all things unfold in the future. 2. But now, so that you may arrange matters better and more easily, hear briefly<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_481_6" id="target_note_LCL522_481_6"><sup>6</sup></a> what my mind prompts me to say.</p>
