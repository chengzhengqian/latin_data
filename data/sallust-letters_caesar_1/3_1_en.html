<p>You waged war, commander,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_483_7" id="target_note_LCL522_483_7"><sup>7</sup></a> with a distinguished man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_483_8" id="target_note_LCL522_483_8"><sup>8</sup></a> endowed with great resources, one greedy for personal power and blessed with greater good fortune than wisdom. He was followed by a few who were your enemies through their own fault,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_483_9" id="target_note_LCL522_483_9"><sup>9</sup></a><span class="italic"> </span>likewise by those who were drawn to his side by a marriage connection or some other tie.—For no one of them had a share in his despotism, and if he had been able to put up with sharing power, the world would not have been convulsed by war.—The rest of the throng followed more in keeping with the habit of the common herd than from deliberate choice, one man lining up behind another, as if the latter were more sensible. At the same time, men whose whole being was stained with infamy and debauchery were influenced by the slanders of unfair critics<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_483_10a" id="target_note_LCL522_483_10a"><sup>10</sup></a> to hope for an opportunity to seize control of the state; they flocked into your camp and openly threatened peaceable citizens with death, robbery, in short, with everything that appealed to a perverted mind. A considerable number of these, however, when they saw that you were not canceling debts and not treating your fellow citizens as enemies, slipped away; a few remained, who had the prospect of enjoying more peace and quiet in your camp than in Rome, so great was the throng of creditors that threatened them there. But it is shocking to relate how many prominent men went over to Pompey afterward from those same motives; and debtors throughout the whole period of the war employed him like a sacred and inviolable shrine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL522_483_11" id="target_note_LCL522_483_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
