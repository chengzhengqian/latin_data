See beneath the shade the bleating flocks with their lords! And the Goddess has bidden the tuneful birds not to be mute: now hoarse-mouthed swans crash trumpeting over the pools; the young wife of Tereus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_359_a" id="target_note_LCL006_359_a"><sup>a</sup></a> makes descant under the popular shade, making you think that tunes of love issued from her melodious mouth, and not a sister’s complaint of her brutal husband. She sings, I am mute. When will my spring come? When shall I become like the swallow, that I may cease to be voiceless? I have lost my Muse through being voiceless, and Phoebus regards me not: so did Amyclae, through being voiceless, perish by its very silence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL006_359_b" id="target_note_LCL006_359_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

But neither this nor the origin of the proverb is certainly known. Servius on Virgil, <span class="italic">Aen.</span> 10.564 relates that Amyclae had several times been unnecessarily terrified by false reports of an enemy’s approach, and a law was passed forbidding the spreading of such news: when eventually the enemy came, no one was prepared to risk uttering a warning, and the city perished.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL006_359_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL006_359_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL006_359_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>Tereus, king of Thrace, married Philomela, who bore him a son Itys; but he seduced his wife’s sister Procne, whose tongue he cut out to prevent her exposing the truth. Even so, Philomela learned what had happened and took vengeance on Tereus by killing Itys. All three were changed into birds: Tereus became a hoopoe, Philomela a nightingale (mourning her lost son under the poplar shade, cf Virgil, <span class="italic">Georg.</span> 4.511 f <span class="italic">populea maerens philomela sub umbra)</span>, and Procne (who thus ceased to be voiceless) a swallow.
