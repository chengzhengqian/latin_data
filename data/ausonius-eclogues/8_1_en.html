<p>In the same way the pound is a solid whole, for it consists of twelve equal parts, and in these equal parts, small though they are, one virtue always abides. For if aught is subtracted from their sum, the total is impaired, the parts are thrown out of place and fall because the frame is ruined. As, if we were to wrench out from an arch the keystone upon which all the voussoirs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_177_1" id="target_note_LCL096_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a> bear, the rest will follow suit and come to the ground, their general downfall caused by the topmost stone; even so is it with the pound. If one ounce is wanting, it will no longer be a pound, but being short in weight will be called <span class="italic">deunx</span> (eleven-twelfths). The <span class="italic">dextans</span> (five-sixths), too, does not retain that name if a <span class="italic">sextans</span> (one-sixth) be taken from it, and the <span class="italic">dodrans</span> (three-quarters) will be left without the author of its being if we subtract the <span class="italic">quadrans</span> (one-fourth). So, too, the <span class="italic">bessis</span> (two-thirds) cannot endure once the <span class="italic">triens</span> (one-third) is torn from it. Take away one scruple,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_177_2" id="target_note_LCL096_177_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and you will have no <span class="italic">quincunx</span> (five-twelfths) left you. And how can the <span class="italic">semis</span> (one-half) be a half if the fractions of the pound thus waste away? And of what pound will the <span class="italic">septunx</span> (seven-twelfths) stand for seven parts? That is a pound, then, which is impaired in no single part. Weight and number, character, tasks, and watersâ€”all have a <span class="italic">libra</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_176_3a" id="target_note_LCL096_176_3a"><sup>3</sup></a>: there is no form of regulation which you may not mark with this name. There is a <span class="italic">libra</span> of the earth, which hangs in mid-air, and a <span class="italic">libra</span> of their own controls the paths
