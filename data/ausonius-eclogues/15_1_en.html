<p>finish of the summer days. Ten times nine days and two and half a day, when hours of light and night are even, the golden Sun passes through in his second race from the Crab to the claws of the Scorpion, mingling the bounds of autumn and of summer. Then, traversing the autumn months in turn, he passes on to the tropic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_191_1" id="target_note_LCL096_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a> star of chill Capricorn, adding further to his tale eight days and ten times eight with a fourth part of the day, which in each fourth year stands at the close of Numa’s month and takes the name of “intercalary.” Then, hastening toward the horns of Agenor’s Bull, the golden Sun climbs up to the tropic star of the fleecy Ram, confining ninety days within ordained bounds. Here, then, you have the full round of the ever-circling years: three hundred and three score days and five.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">XVI.—Which Constellation the Sun passes Through in each Month</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> tropic star of Capricorn prescribes the opening of Janus’s reign. In the midst of Numa’s month stands the sign of stout Aquarius. The Fishes twain come forth in days of March. Thou, Ram of Phrixus, lookest back on April’s calends. May marvels at the horns of Agenor’s Bull. June sees the Spartan twins march in the heavens. July brings the star of the Crab which blazes at the solstice. The raging lion scorches the month of August with his fires. Beneath thy star, O Virgin, September loads the vines. October’s seed-time balances the Scales. The wintry Scorpion bids November go headlong. The Archer ends his shining in mid-December.</p>
