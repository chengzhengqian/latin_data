<p>“To whom do I give my pretty, new book?” quoth the poet of Verona long ago, and, straightway finding Nepos, presented it to him. But this ugly, rough little book—junk, trash, and drivelling—to whose bosom shall I commit it to be cherished? I have it! (Peace, my anxious trifles!) ’Tis one not less learned and more generous than he with whom Gaul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_163_1" id="target_note_LCL096_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a> furnished Catullus. No one of my own kin is dearer to me than he, and the Nine Sisters esteem him more than all other poets saving Maro. “No doubt, sir Poet, it is Pacatus whom you mean?” The very man! Take wing without a fear, my verses, and nestle safely in his bosom. He will be ready to fondle you, he to guard you; he will hide away your shortcomings, will pass on what he approves: after him, fear ye no critic! Farewell.</p>
