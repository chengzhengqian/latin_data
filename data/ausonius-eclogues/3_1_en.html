<p>us to keep faith. Live your life and always practise friendship: that was the very charge which destroyed the learned college of the Pythagorean sages.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_167_1" id="target_note_LCL096_167_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Fearing this end, then, make no friendships: that was the very charge on which Timon was stoned of old in Athens, dear to Pallas. Conflicting wishes ever beset and distract our hearts, nor is it enough for a man that things are as he wished; for what he once longed to have, he now refuses. His heart is set on rank and dignities, but presently he regrets his wish: he is content to obey, that he may command one day: he rises to high station, and straightway is exposed to envy. Learning costs sleepless nights of toil; yet ignorance lacks all that makes life fair. Become a pleader and defend the accused: you will find it rare to get a thankful client. Well, be a client then: you cannot bear your patron’s domineering ways. A man prays earnestly to become a father: soon, harsh cares and anxieties steal upon him. Yet, on the other hand, childless old age is scorned; and he who lacks heirs is the fortune-hunter’s prey. Should you live sparingly, people will tear your character to rags for a miser. Be prodigal, and you will incur a heavier charge. All paths in life confront you with unfavourable issues. Therefore the opinion of the Greeks is wisest; for they say that it is good for a man not to be born at all, or, being born, to die quickly.</p>
