<p><span class="sc">Young</span> Janus, who givest thy name to the first month of the year, twy-faced Janus, thou dost behold two seasons at one time. After worship of the gods, Numa ordains Februa in the next month, a feast of offerings to the shades of kinsfolk. Martian, leader both of the Roman race and year, thou wast wont to bring in the beginning of the Latin consulate. Mother of the sons of Aeneas, thou, Venus, givest thy name to April, the month which follows next; for Aphrodite keeps Mars company. I am in doubt whether the goddess Maia or generations passed (<span class="italic">maiores</span>) named thee May, but either is a good patron for a month. June follows next with double title to renown, whether it was Juno or Juventa who lent her name. Then July, brilliant with Dione’s star,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_185_1a" id="target_note_LCL096_185_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> occupies the fixed season of midsummer. Augustus’ month follows that named after his kinsman Julius, next in the year’s order even as he in race. Next comes a string of months marked by successive numbers: September, who soaks the presses with Bacchus’ gift; October, gladdened with the seasons’ usury for seedling grain, who flatters the grasping farmer’s hopes; November, who casts headlong her appointed stars, and plunges them in the brine, soon to return to heaven their home. December closes the list and ends our cheerful feasts, that from winter a new year may presently go forth.</p>
