<h2><span class="sc">VIII.—On the Names of the Seven Days</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">The</span> names borne by the seven days recurring throughout the year, are given by as many planets, which the firmament rolls along in unwearied revolutions, bidding them roam amid the stars which stand athwart them. The first day and the last the raycrowned Sun holds for his own. The Moon next succeeds to her brother’s crown. Mars, following these Titan lights, is counted third. Mercury claims for his own the stars of the fourth day. The golden star of Jupiter illumines the fifth zone; and in the sixth place kindly Venus follows the health-bringing father of the gods. The seventh day is Saturn’s, and comes last of all; for on the eighth the circling orbit restores the Sun once more.</p>
