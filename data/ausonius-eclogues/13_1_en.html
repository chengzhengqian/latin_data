<h2><span class="sc">XI.—On the Three Sacrificial Days of the Month</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">Twelve</span> times a year Lucina renews the Calends, and as often do the Ides recur by Jove’s gift at the mid-month, while eight successive days before<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_187_1a" id="target_note_LCL096_187_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> produce the Nones. The Roman month has these three names alone: all other days are known by numerals.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">XII.—How many Days there are in each Month</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">June</span>, April, and November, with September, each month of these has thirty days. For each of seven months add one besides to thrice ten days, one to the Calends of Janus and of Mars, and one to those which May, July, and August bring, and one to October and December, the last month of all. A single month remains with but eight and twenty days, that month which Numa caused to follow next to Janus, the leader of the year. Thus the year reckons its days to be three hundred and sixty-five, with one quarter day.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">XIII.—On what Dates the Nones and Ides Fall in Various Months</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">Sometimes</span> the fourth dawn after the Calends opens the Nones, sometimes the sixth brings them back. The sixth brings them back as May, October, March come round, and July, who intrudes his season on the solstice. The remaining months have their Nones on the fourth day; while the Ides always come round on the eighth day after Nones.</p>
