of inconstant Mars. Though you draw with you the entire might of Greece, though your soldiers deploy their weapons far and wide, the fortunes of war always stand in doubt. Mars decides everything; two men, however unevenly matched, are made equal by the sword. Both hopes and fears are tossed about by blind Chance. The reward you seek is unassured, but assured the crime. Suppose your prayers are favored by all the gods—citizens have given ground and fled, soldiers lie covering the fields in mortal carnage: though you exult and bear spoils from your overthrown brother as victor, yet the palm of victory must be broken. What sort of war do you think it is, where the victor commits a detestable outrage if he celebrates? You have a hapless desire to defeat this man, yet you will mourn him after defeating him! Come, drop this accursed fight; free your country from fear and your parents from grief.</p>

He will suffer a punishment, a heavy one indeed: he will reign. This is a punishment. If you doubt it, believe your grandfather and father; Cadmus will tell you this, and Cadmus’ descendants. No Theban has been able to wield the scepter with impunity—and yet none held it by breaking faith: already you may count your brother among them.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
