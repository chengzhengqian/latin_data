<p class="noindent">If you demand a kingdom, if your hand must hold a cruel scepter, any land throughout the world will offer much to be won. In one region Mt. Tmolus raises peaks well known to Bacchus, where lie broad tracts of productive land, and where the Pactolus with its heavy, opulent stream floods the fields with gold; the Meander winds its vagrant waters through equally fruitful acres, and the swift Hermus cuts through fertile plains. In another region is Gargara, dear to Ceres, and the rich soil encircled by the Xanthus, swollen with Mt. Ida’s snows. Here, where the Ionian Sea relinquishes its name, as Sestos opposite Abydos narrows the strait,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_297_16" id="target_note_LCL062_297_16"><sup>16</sup></a> or where it veers closer to the East and looks on Lycia with its many protective harbors—here seek out a kingdom with the sword; let your doughty father-in-law bear arms against these peoples, let him win these nations and deliver them to your scepter: but consider <span class="italic">this</span> kingdom as still held by your father. Better is exile for you than a return such as this: your exile is due to another’s crime, but your return will be due to your own. Better use these forces of yours to seek a new realm unblemished by crime. Indeed your very brother will accompany your troops and fight for you. Go, and wage a war in which your father and mother can support you as you fight. A kingdom won with crime is more burdensome than any exile.</p>
<p>Picture now the mishaps of war, the unsure vicissitudes
