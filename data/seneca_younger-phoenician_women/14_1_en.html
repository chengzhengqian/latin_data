She carried that horrific deed in the hand that had committed it, a bloodstained maenad bearing spoils of her dismembered son; she committed the crime, but beyond that the poor woman did not come face to face with her crime. That I am guilty is a trivial thing: I have made others guilty. Even this too is trivial: I have born sons who are guilty. My troubles were incomplete without my loving my enemy as well! Thrice has winter laid down its snows, and the third harvest has now dropped before the sickle, while my son has been wandering as a fugitive, deprived of his fatherland, and asking as an exile for the help of Greece’s kings.

I do not know what I should hope for or decide. He demands his kingdom back: his cause is good when he seeks it back, but bad when he seeks it thus. As a parent, what prayers should I make? On each side I see a son. I can do nothing loyally without destroying my loyalty; any hopes I have for one son will harm the other if realized. Yet, though I love each with equal affection, my spirit inclines where it is pulled by the better cause and the worse situation, for it always favors the weak; misfortune brings the wretched closer to their loved ones.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
