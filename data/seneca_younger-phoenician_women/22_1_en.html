father’s contemporaries in shackles? And shall mothers, torn from their husbands’ very arms, be dragged off loaded with chains by cruel soldiers? Are unmarried women of Thebes to go as gifts to the young wives of Argos, amid the throng of prisoners? Shall I, your very mother, ride with my hands tied behind my back, as booty in your parade of triumph over your brother? Can you watch your fellow citizens given over to death and destruction all around you? Can you move enemy troops up to these dear walls, can you fill Thebes with blood and flame? Are you so savage, hardhearted, cruel in pursuit of anger? And not yet in power! What will the scepter do? Put aside the feverish madness of your spirit, I pray you; bring yourself back to love and duty.</p>

<p class="noindent">So I am to wander forever in exile? To be barred from my fatherland, and as a stranger chase after support from a foreign nation? What else would I suffer if I had broken faith, if I had violated my oath? Shall I be punished for another’s treachery, while he gains the reward of his crimes?</p>
<p>You bid me leave. I submit to my mother’s command—but give me somewhere to return to! My brother may live in a proud palace, while a small hut hides me—but grant me the hut, if you drive me away; let me have a humble home to compensate for a kingdom. Am I to be presented to my wife as a chattel, to endure the harsh control of a wealthy bride, and to run after my lordly father-in-law as a lowly camp follower? It is painful to fall into servitude from kingship.</p>
