Let my brothers strive with the sword for Laius’ glorious house and his rich kingdom; the chief part of our father’s great kingdom—our father himself—is mine. He shall not be taken from me by the brother who holds Thebes’ scepter by theft of the throne, nor by the other who leads squadrons from Argos. Not even if Jove should thunder, rending the heavens, and the bolt should fall right between our close bodies, would I release this hand. Though you forbid me, father, I shall guide you despite refusals, direct your unwilling steps. Do you head for level ground? I come too. Do you make for the cliffs? I do not hinder you, but go before you. Use me as your guide to any goal, any path is chosen for both of us. You cannot perish without me, but with me you can. Here a high crag rises to a lofty peak, looking far out over the reaches of the sea beneath it: do you want us to make for that? Here a bare rock is poised, here the rent earth yawns open in a broken chasm: do you want us to make for that? Here a sweeping torrent falls, and whirls around eroded fragments of a fallen hillside: should we plunge into that? I go wherever you wish—only before you. I do not plead against anything, I do not urge anything. Do you long for annihilation, father, is death your chief prayer? If you die, I go before; if you live, I follow. But change your thinking, summon up your courage of old, and vanquish your troubles with sturdy resolve. Fight back; amid such evils, to die is a defeat.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
