the deep seas from its immense height, where a mother, fleeing from her own crime and committing a new one, leaped into the strait to drown her child and herself: lucky those to whom a better fortune gave such good mothers!</p>
<p>There is another place, my place, in those forests, that calls me back.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_255_2" id="target_note_LCL062_255_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I shall make for it in urgent haste, my steps will not falter, I shall go there bereft of any guide. Why keep my own abode waiting? Give me back my death, Cithaeron; restore to me that lodging place of mine, so I may die in old age where I should have died in infancy; receive the long overdue punishment. Always bloody, savage, cruel, ferocious, when you kill and when you spare! This carcass was yours long ago. Carry out my father’s command—my mother’s too, now. My spirit is eager to execute the punishment of old.</p>
<p>Why, daughter, do you hold me bound by this pestilential love? Why hold me? My father calls. I follow, I follow, stop now! Laius rages, bearing the bloodied symbol of his stolen kingship; see, he attacks my empty eyes and claws at them with his malevolent hands. Daughter, can you see my father? I can see him! Finally spew out this hated life, my spirit—you quitter, brave only against a portion of yourself! Drop these idle delays in your long postponed punishment, and accept death in full. Why do I sluggishly drag out such life as I have? Am I incapable now of committing a crime? I <span class="italic">am</span> capable, wretched man, I give warning: leave your father, leave while a virgin. After my mother I fear everything.</p>
