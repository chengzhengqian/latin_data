into conflict with the State. Affection for his brother inspired the proposal but he abandoned his plan in response to his brother’s request. In a situation in <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">63</span><span class="br"></span> which both men deserve our praise Lucius Caecilius is used as a means of attacking Sulla. Firstly, Caecilius: “he introduced a bill which gave the impression that he wanted to reverse the decision of the court in order to restore Sulla to his former position.” If so, then you are right to condemn him. The stability of the constitution depends upon decisions of the courts more than anything else, and I do not think that affection for a brother should count for so much that a man may sacrifice the public safety in the interests of his family. His proposal, however, did not affect the verdict; it only raised the question of the penalty for bribery which had recently been introduced in earlier legislation. This bill, therefore, did not seek to reverse the court’s decision, only to rectify a defect in the law. No one complaining of a penalty questions the court’s decision, only the law. The conviction—which was to stand—is the verdict of the court; the penalty—which was to be mitigated—is fixed by the law. Do not then try to alienate <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">64</span><span class="br"></span> from our case the feelings of those orders<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_376_a" id="target_note_LCL324_376_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which conduct the courts with such dignity and authority. No one has tried to reverse a decision, no proposal like that has been made; Caecilius has always thought that in the disaster of his brother’s conviction the authority of the court should be upheld but the rigour of the law softened. But why should I prolong this discussion? I should perhaps say more, and say it readily and willingly, if family feeling and affection for his brother had driven Lucius Caecilius even a little further than the scope of our ordinary obligations
