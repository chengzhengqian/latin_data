that I sent to Gnaeus Pompeius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_380_a" id="target_note_LCL324_380_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in which I set out my achievements in office and the supreme interest of the State. In it you look for some charge against Publius Sulla, and you say that by writing that the incredible folly conceived two years previously had erupted in my consulship I showed that Sulla had been in the earlier conspiracy. I am, of course, the very man to think that Gnaeus Piso, Catiline, Vargunteius and Autronius were incapable of any criminal or reckless act by themselves without Publius Sulla. Even if anyone had previously been in <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">68</span><span class="br"></span> doubt about Sulla or had in mind what you attribute to him—a plot to murder your father and enter the Forum as consul with lictors on the 1st of January—you removed all suspicion of this when you said that he had collected a force of thugs against your father in order to make Catiline consul. If I were to admit the truth of this allegation, then you must agree with me that when, as you maintain, he was supporting Catiline’s campaign he had no thought of recovering by force the consulship which he had lost by the decision of the court. Furthermore, gentlemen, Sulla’s character does not admit the allegation of such serious and dastardly crimes.</p>
<p>Now that I have refuted almost<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_380_b" id="target_note_LCL324_380_b"><sup>b</sup></a> all the charges, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">69</span><span class="br"></span> I shall follow a procedure different from that usually adopted in cases and take my client’s life and character last. At the outset I was all eagerness to come to grips with an accusation as important as this, to satisfy men’s expectations and, since I had been accused, to say something on my own behalf. Now I must call your attention back to the subject to which, even if I were silent, the case itself turns your thoughts and feelings.</p>
