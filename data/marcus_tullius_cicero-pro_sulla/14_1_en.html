if my loyal support never fails friends at the Bar or the Republic in the House; if no respite after my exertions nor plea on the grounds either of office or of age frees me from toil; if my goodwill, my unremitting efforts, my house, my brain and my ears are at the service of all comers; if time is not left me to record and recollect even those measures which I took for the general safety; will this still be called tyranny when no one can be found willing to succeed to it? The suspicion of being a tyrant is quite <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> foreign to my character; but if you ask who have tried to establish tyrannies at Rome, do not search through historical records, you will find them in your own family-tree.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_341_aa" id="target_note_LCL324_341_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> Yes, I suppose my achievements have made me too proud and bred in me a sort of arrogance; but of these glorious and deathless achievements, gentlemen, I can say this: I shall be amply rewarded for saving this city and the lives of all its citizens from direst peril if no danger falls upon my person from this great service to all mankind. I remember the situation in the State in which I <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> wrought these great deeds and I understand the situation in the city in which I live. The Forum is full of those men whom I have driven from your throats, gentlemen, but have not removed from mine. You may, of course, think that those who could attempt or expect to be able to destroy so powerful an Empire were few in number. I could—and did—snatch their torches and twist their swords from their grasp, but their criminal and evil intent I could not heal or remove. I am not ignorant, then, of the danger involved in my living among such a crowd
