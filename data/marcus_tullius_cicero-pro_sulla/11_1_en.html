evidence were condemned and the man whom you defend hopes to be acquitted.” My reply to you regarding the evidence I gave is this: if I lied, you too gave evidence against those defendants; but if I spoke the truth, it is not tyranny, when one tells the truth on oath, to make good one’s case. Of Sulla’s hopes I have only this to say: Publius Sulla expects from me no limitless resources, no misuse of my power, nothing but the conscientious discharge of the duties of a counsel for the defence. “If you had not <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> accepted the case,” he says, “he would never have opposed me but would have gone into exile without standing trial.” Suppose for the moment that Quintus Hortensius with all his authority, that the men like him whom you see here in court take their stand, not on their own judgement, but on mine; suppose, incredible though it is, that if I were not supporting Sulla they would not have done so, tell me: which is the tyrant?

If I am, it is less surprising that I am a tyrant, since you say that Rome has already had two foreign tyrants, than that Rome has had a foreign consul. “I mean,” he says, “that you came from an Italian borough.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_334_c" id="target_note_LCL324_334_c"><sup>c</sup></a> I admit it and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> I also add that I am from a town which has twice now brought salvation to this city and her empire.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_335_d" id="target_note_LCL324_335_d"><sup>d</sup></a> I
