much information, was not believing everything, but was providing against every eventuality, I repeat what I said at the beginning, that no manâ€™s information, message, suspicion, or letter revealed to me anything implicating Publius Sulla.</p>
<p>Therefore, you gods of our fathers and of our <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">86</span><span class="br"></span> homes, who watch over this city and this State, who during my consulship brought your power and your assistance to the preservation of our empire, of our liberty, of the people of Rome, of our homes and our temples, I call you to witness that I am defending the case of Publius Sulla with my judgement uncorrupted and unfettered, that I am not knowingly concealing any crime, that I am not defending and hiding any attempt made upon the safety of us all. When I was consul I discovered nothing about my client, I suspected nothing, I heard nothing. I, the man who <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">87</span><span class="br"></span> appeared harsh towards some and implacable towards the others,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_400_a" id="target_note_LCL324_400_a"><sup>a</sup></a> have discharged my obligation to my country. There now remains my obligation to my normal practice and to my nature. I am as compassionate as yourselves, gentlemen, as lenient as the mildest of men. When I shared your severity, I only acted under compulsion; the State was collapsing in ruins, I came to its aid; my country had been engulfed, I rescued it; we were led by pity for our fellow-countrymen to act with severity, but only so far as was necessary. The safety of all would have vanished in a single night, if I had not adopted such severity. If my patriotism led me to punish the criminals, my natural inclination leads me to save the innocent.</p>
<p>I see nothing in my client, Publius Sulla, that <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">88</span><span class="br"></span> deserves hatred, but much that merits compassion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_400_b" id="target_note_LCL324_400_b"><sup>b</sup></a>
