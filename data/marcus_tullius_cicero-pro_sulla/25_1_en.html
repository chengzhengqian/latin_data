honour—your father’s consulship—was at stake, your father in his great wisdom was not angry with his closest friends when they defended Sulla and sang his praises. He knew that it was a custom inherited from our ancestors that friendship for no man should stop us from acting for the defence. But that earlier dispute was very different from the present case. On that occasion, if Publius Sulla were condemned, your family could secure the consulship and this was what happened. It was a struggle for office. You went about shouting that you were suing for what had been stolen from you, for victory in the Forum after defeat in the Campus Martius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_362_a" id="target_note_LCL324_362_a"><sup>a</sup></a> On that occasion, your closest friends were working against you in his defence but they did not incur your anger; they were taking the consulship from you and opposing your rise to office, but they still did this without forfeiting your friendship, without breaking their obligation to you, and were following the ancient precedent and tradition of all the best men. In this <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span> case, however, what distinctions of yours am I imperilling and what office of yours am I attacking? What more are you now trying to get from Sulla? His office went to your father and the insignia of his office to you. Adorned with his spoils you come to mutilate the man whom you have destroyed, and I, as he lies there stripped, defend and protect him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_362_b" id="target_note_LCL324_362_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Such are the circumstances in which you blame me and are angry with me for defending him. Yet, far from being angry with you, I do not even blame you for what you have done. I think that you decided for yourself what you thought should be done and were able to be a perfectly competent judge of where your duty lay.</p>
