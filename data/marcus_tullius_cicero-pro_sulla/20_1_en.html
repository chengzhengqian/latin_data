In order to give the Gauls more confidence he did not want to say that Sulla was not of their number, but he did not dare to say what was untrue,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_352_a" id="target_note_LCL324_352_a"><sup>a</sup></a> so he said that he did not know. It is abundantly clear that, if a man who has known about all those involved has denied that he knew about Sulla, his denial is the equivalent of saying that he knew that Sulla was not involved in the conspiracy. For, when it is accepted that somebody has known about all those involved, his ignorance about an individual ought to be taken as clearing him. But I am not inquiring now whether Cassius clears Sulla; it is quite sufficient for me that there is nothing against Sulla in the information.</p>
