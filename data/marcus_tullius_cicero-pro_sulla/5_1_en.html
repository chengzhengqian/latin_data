and mildness throughout my whole life.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_322_a" id="target_note_LCL324_322_a"><sup>a</sup></a> There is, then, no reason why you should pick upon <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> me to omit from this great company of distinguished men. Duty is indivisible and the cause of loyal men is common to all. You will have no ground for surprise after this, if you see me in the party in which you observe these men.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_322_b" id="target_note_LCL324_322_b"><sup>b</sup></a> There is no political interest that is mine exclusively. The occasion for action fell to me and not to them but we all shared the distress, the terror and the danger. Indeed, I could not at the time have been the guide to safety, had not others been willing to accompany me. For this reason, as a private citizen, I must now share with everybody else that responsibility which during my consulship was peculiarly mine and shared with only a few others.
