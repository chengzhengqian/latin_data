Sulla, Publius Sulla, Marcus Laeca or Gaius Cornelius deserved to be defended?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_320_a" id="target_note_LCL324_320_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Who of those here in court came to their aid? Not one. Why was this? Because men loyal to their friends think that in other types of case they should not desert them even if they are guilty, but in a case such as this you would not only be guilty of irresponsibility but also in danger of infection, as it were, from the crime if you were to defend a man whom you suspect of being implicated in high treason. Look at Autronius! Did not his <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> boon companions, his colleagues and his old friends, of whom he had formerly enjoyed a wide circle, did not all of them who are leading men in the State fail him? The majority, indeed, went further and gave evidence against him. They had decided that his crime was so heinous that it was their duty not only not to conceal it but in addition to lay it bare and bring it to the light of day. What cause, then, for you to be surprised that in this case you see me giving my support in the company of men with whom, as you know, I withheld it in the other cases? It may, of course, be that you want me to be singled out for a reputation of being fiercer, more hard-hearted and less compassionate than the others, possessed of an unparalleled savagery and cruelty. If you characterize <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> the whole of my life, Torquatus, on the basis of my consulship, you are very much mistaken. Nature meant to me be merciful, my country meant me to be firm, neither country nor Nature meant me to be cruel. Furthermore, my disposition and Nature have now caused me to shed that harsh and stern role which the Stateâ€™s circumstances forced upon me at the time. My country demanded severity for a short time; Nature has sought compassion
