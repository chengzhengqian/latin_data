I say this because Cassius, trying to involve foreigners in the war, did not want to lessen their suspicion or to clear those of whom they seemed to suspect something.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_350_a" id="target_note_LCL324_350_a"><sup>a</sup></a> He did <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">37</span><span class="br"></span> not in fact reply that Sulla was working with him. Indeed it would be ridiculous for him, when he had named the others without prompting, only to mention Sulla after being reminded or specifically asked about him.
