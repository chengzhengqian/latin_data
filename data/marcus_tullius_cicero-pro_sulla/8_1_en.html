Torquatus to stop expressing his surprise that I am defending Sulla when I have not supported Autronius. What was Autronius’ case and what was Sulla’s? <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> Autronius wanted to break up the court that was trying him for bribery and stop the case, first by organizing a riot of gladiators and runaway slaves and then, as we all saw, by stone-throwing and an attack on the court.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_328_a" id="target_note_LCL324_328_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Sulla sought no aid if the propriety of his behaviour and his personal standing were not going to help him.
