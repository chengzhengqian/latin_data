that did not touch this man, robbed of his reputation, office and fortune? For what new calamity has any room been left?

<p>My mental anguish, gentlemen, prevents me now <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">92</span><span class="br"></span> from saying more about Sulla’s misfortune. The part is now yours to play, gentlemen, and I entrust the whole case to your compassion and humanity. You were hastily empanelled and have sat upon this case after objections had been introduced when we were not expecting them. You were selected by the prosecution in the hope of a harsh verdict, you have been chosen for us by fortune to protect innocence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_407_aa" id="target_note_LCL324_407_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> I felt anxious about what the Roman people thought of me because I had acted with severity towards malefactors and I undertook the first defence of an innocent man that was offered to me; do you too, then, temper with your lenience and compassion the severity of the verdicts which have been passed during recent months upon the most brazen of criminals.

Th.

J. L. Strachan-Davidson, <span class="italic">Problems of the Roman Criminal Law</span> 2. 98-99, suggests that the jurors were the normal <span class="italic">editicii iudices</span> (see p. 306) and that the word  <span class="italic">fortuna</span> is justified by the ignorance or incompetence (<span class="italic">cf. pro Plancio</span> 41) of the prosecution in making their selection, or by the chance which left only some members of the panel free for this case. Cicero wants to complain of the method of selection and at the same time congratulate himself upon the fine body of men that he sees before him, and <span class="italic">fortuna</span> serves to bridge the inconsistency between the two insinuations.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL324_407_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
