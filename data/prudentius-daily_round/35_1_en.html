to Thee? No vows that we can offer in our prayers can make up for the price of salvation. Though we should turn utterly from food, and of our own will weaken and mortify our bodies, and disdaining the table pray to Thee night and day, yet the zeal with which we serve Thee is ever inferior and over-matched and cannot equal the Father’s gift, and our frame of clay cannot bear to practise endurance overmuch. Therefore, lest our strength be undone and desert the frail clay, and a watery fluid prevail in whitened veins, enfeebling and unmanning the body, an easy and free measure of abstinence is laid on all; no stern fear drives us; it is each one’s own power that constrains him to be willing. Sufficient is it, whatever a man does, to set about it after first appealing for God’s approval, whether he refuse the table or put forth his hand to take food. God is propitious and with favourable countenance gives consent and blessing; as now we trust it will be healthful for us that we eat of these dedicated viands. Humbly I ask that our act be good for us and that our food, spreading into the veins, may bring healing to the body and nourish the spirit of Christ’s worshippers who offer this prayer.</p>
