to resume the fight; yet he will be more blessed in whom the day, when it appears, finds the unruly body lamed and wasted with the struggle. At last let the blindness be gone, which has long caused us to fall into danger and made us wander from the path with misguided steps. May this light give us a clear day and make us pure to meet it; let us speak no guile and think no dark thought. So may the whole day pass that neither lying tongue, nor hands, nor straying eyes commit sin, nor any guilt stain our body. There is One that stands by watching from above, who each day views us and our doings from dawn of light till evening. He is witness, He is judge; He looks on every thought the mind of man conceives, and this judge none can dupe.</p>

Put away, my Muse, the paltry ivy-leaves wherewith thou hast been wont to encircle thy brows; learn to weave mystic garlands and tie them with a band of dactyls,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL387_21_a" id="target_note_LCL387_21_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
and wear thy hair wreathed with the praise of God. What worthier service can the high-born soul, native of light and heaven, pay, than to chant the gifts she has received, singing of her Creator? For He has given all things to man, and we take them with a hand that bears dominion; all that sky or earth or sea produces in air or flood or field, all this
