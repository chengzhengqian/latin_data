the fallen breeds that followed a barbarous ritual and baked a fearful idol in burning furnaces, now abandon the smoke-grimed gods of their forefathers, of stone or metal or wood, filed smooth or hewn or cut, to honour Christ. Rejoice, all ye nations, Judaea, Rome and Greece, Egypt, Thracian, Persian, Scythian: one King is master of all. Praise your Lord every one, blessed and lost alike, the quick, the feeble, and the dead; no man henceforth is dead.</p>
