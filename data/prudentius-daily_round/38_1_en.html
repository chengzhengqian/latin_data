is nigh: driven out, the thousand-formed plague of treacherous devils seizes upon an unclean, filthy herd of swine and plunges itself and the maddened beasts together in the black waters. Bring ye in baskets twelve the fragments left from the feast; the guests in their thousands are now amply filled with the eating of five loaves of bread and a pair of fishes. Thou art our meat and our bread, Thou our sweet savour that never fails; he can never hunger any more who partakes of Thy banquet, not filling a void in his belly but refreshing that by which he truly lives. The closed avenue of the ears, that knows no sound, clears away at Christ’s bidding all its thick obstructions and gains the power to enjoy voices and give passage to whispers. Every sickness yields, every weakness is banished, the tongue speaks that had been tied in torpid silence, and the sick man carries his bed rejoicing through the city. Yea, lest those below should have no part in salvation, in His goodness He enters Tartarus. The door is forced and yields before Him; the bolts are torn away, down falls the pivot broken; that gate so ready to receive the inrush, so unyielding in face of those that would return, is unbarred and gives back the dead; the law is reversed, and the black doorway stands open to be retrodden. But while God with golden light was illumining the vaults of death, giving bright day to the astounded night, the sky was darkened and the stars dimmed in sadness; the sun fled, clad in the gloom of mourning, from the fiery heavens, and in sorrow hid himself away. ’Tis said the world shuddered in fear of the darkness of eternal night.
