<p>Now that we have fed our flesh, taking the food which the weakly law of our body requires, let our tongue render due praise to God the Father, the Father who, sitting on the supreme throne, holds sway over Cherubim and Seraphim, His sacred seat. This is He whom we call God of Sabaoth, who is without beginning and without end, maker of all things and creator of the world, source of life flowing from the clear light of heaven, who inspires faith and implants goodness in us, the conqueror of death and author of salvation. From Him do we all have our being and our life. The Spirit reigns eternal, He whom both Christ and His Father have sent. In His purity He enters chaste hearts, which are consecrated as His temple, smiling brightly when they have drunk deep of God. But if He perceives sin or guile arising in the flesh now dedicated to Him, swiftly He departs as from an unclean shrine. For the disordered conscience burns foully with thick smoke as the fire of sin rages, and its blackness offends and drives away the good. Yet not alone do purity and innocent desire make an everlasting temple for Christ in the depths of the heart within us, but we must beware of the fever of excess that would stuff in food till the mass of it constricted the seat
