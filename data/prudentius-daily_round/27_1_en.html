Christ, at our pious acts of abstinence, and as our King look with favour on our holy day while we offer the sacrifice of our fast. Nothing surely is purer than this rite, whereby the heart is enlivened through the cleansing of its tissues, and the intemperate flesh subdued so that fat, exuding the stinking sweat of excess, shall not constrict and choke the mind.
