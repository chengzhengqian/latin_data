the day of the triumph, which they celebrated together, he shared with his brother the names which had been granted to himself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_225_1" id="target_note_LCL139_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> After he had returned from the Parthian war, however, Verus exhibited less regard for his brother; for he pampered his freedmen<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_225_2" id="target_note_LCL139_225_2"><sup>2</sup></a> shamefully, and settled many things without his brother’s counsel. Besides all this, he brought actors out of Syria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_225_3" id="target_note_LCL139_225_3"><sup>3</sup></a> as proudly as though he were leading kings to a triumph. The chief of these was Maximinus, on whom he bestowed the name Paris. Furthermore, he built an exceedingly notorious villa on the Clodian Way,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_225_4" id="target_note_LCL139_225_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and here he not only revelled himself for many days at a time in boundless extravagance together with his freedmen and friends of inferior rank in whose presence he felt no shame, but he even invited Marcus. Marcus came, in order to display to his brother the purity of his own moral code as worthy of respect and imitation, and for five days, staying in the same villa, he busied himself continuously with the examination of law-cases, while his brother, in the meantime, was either banqueting or preparing banquets. Verus maintained also the actor Agrippus, surnamed Memphius, whom he had brought with him from Syria, almost as a trophy of the Parthian war, and named Apolaustus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_225_5a" id="target_note_LCL139_225_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> He had brought with him, too, players of the harp and the flute, actors and jesters from the mimes, jugglers, and all kinds of slaves in whose entertainment Syria and Alexandria find pleasure, and in such numbers, indeed, that he seemed to have concluded a war, not against Parthians, but against actors.</p>
