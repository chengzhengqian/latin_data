<p>Verus was well-proportioned in person and genial of expression. His beard was allowed to grow long, almost in the style of the barbarians; he was tall, and stately in appearance, for his forehead projected somewhat over his eyebrows. He took such pride in his yellow hair, it is said, that he used to sift gold-dust on his head in order that his hair, thus brightened, might seem yellower. He was somewhat halting in speech, a reckless gambler, ever of an extravagant mode of life, and in many respects, save only that he was not cruel or given to acting, a second Nero. Among other articles of extravagance he had a crystal goblet, named Volucer after that horse of which he had been very fond,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_231_2" id="target_note_LCL139_231_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that surpassed the capacity of any human draught.</p>

<p>XI. He lived forty-two years,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_231_3" id="target_note_LCL139_231_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and, in company with his brother, reigned eleven.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_231_4" id="target_note_LCL139_231_4"><sup>4</sup></a> His body was laid in the Tomb of Hadrian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_231_5" id="target_note_LCL139_231_5"><sup>5</sup></a> where Caesar, his real father, was also buried.</p>
<p>There is a well-known story,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_231_6" id="target_note_LCL139_231_6"><sup>6</sup></a> which Marcus’ manner of life will not warrant, that Marcus handed Verus part of a sow’s womb which he had poisoned by cutting it with a knife smeared on one side with poison. But it is wrong even to think of such a deed in connection with Marcus, although the plans and deeds of Verus may have well deserved it; nor shall we leave the matter undecided, but rather reject it discarded and disproved, since from the time of Marcus onward, with the exception of your Clemency, Diocletian Augustus, not even flattery, it seems, has been able to fashion such an emperor.</p>
