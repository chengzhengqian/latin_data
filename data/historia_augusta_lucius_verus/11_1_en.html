<p>IX. This diversity in their manner of life, as well as many other causes, bred dissensions between Marcus and Verus—or so it was bruited about by obscure rumours although never established on the basis of manifest truth. But, in particular, this incident was mentioned: Marcus sent a certain Libo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_227_1" id="target_note_LCL139_227_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a cousin of his, as his legate to Syria, and there Libo acted more insolently than a respectful senator should, saying that he would write to his cousin if he happened to need any advice. But Verus, who was there in Syria, could not suffer this, and when, a little later, Libo died after a sudden illness accompanied by all the symptoms of poisoning, it seemed probable to some people, though not to Marcus, that Verus was responsible for his death; and this suspicion strengthened the rumours of dissensions between the Emperors.</p>
<p>Verus’ freedmen, furthermore, had great influence with him, as we related in the Life of Marcus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_227_2" id="target_note_LCL139_227_2"><sup>2</sup></a> namely Geminas and Agaclytus.

Verus had other unscrupulous freedmen as well, Coedes and Eclectus and others. All of these Marcus dismissed after Verus’ death, under pretext of doing them honour, with the exception of Eclectus, and he afterwards slew Marcus’ son, Commodus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_227_3" id="target_note_LCL139_227_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>When the German war broke out, the two Emperors <span class="marginNote right">166</span>went to the front together, for Marcus wished neither to send Lucius to the war alone, nor yet, because of his debauchery, to leave him in the city. When they had come to Aquileia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_227_4" id="target_note_LCL139_227_4"><sup>4</sup></a> they proceeded to cross the Alps, though this was contrary to Lucius’
