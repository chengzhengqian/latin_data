Verus obeyed Marcus, whenever he entered upon any undertaking, as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor. For, at the beginning, he addressed the soldiers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_215_1" id="target_note_LCL139_215_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in his brother’s behalf as well as his own, and in consideration of the joint rule he conducted himself with dignity and observed the moral standard that Marcus had set up.</p>
