</span> There’s no reason why I should be cross with the young
man for not knowing who her father was. He was a poor
man of advancing years, whose whole life was his work,
and he kept himself to the country most of the time,
where he had some land to farm from my father. The old
man used to tell me in those days how this relative of his
neglected him. But what a man! The best I’ve seen in my
whole life!</p></div>
