why don’t you go up to him and say something soothing to
start with?</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> Your safe return—</p></div>

<span class="sc">phae</span>

</span> What’s the matter?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Should I <span class="italic">not</span> be angry with him? I can’t wait for him to
show his face, so I can tell him that his easygoing father
has become an extremely harsh one and it’s all his fault.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Listen to that! It’s all the same. They’re all alike: know
one, you know them all.</p></div>
