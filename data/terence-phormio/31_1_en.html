</span> (<span class="italic">to Dorio</span>) Aren’t you ashamed to be so unscrupulous?</p></div>

</span> Not at all, if I profit by it.</p></div>

</span> Dorio, should you really behave like this?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dor</span>
</span> That’s how I am. If you like me, do business with me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> Are you going to cheat him just like that?</p></div>

<span class="sc">dor</span>
</span> On the contrary, Antipho, he’s cheating <span class="italic">me.</span> He knew the
sort of person I am, whereas I thought he was different.
He’s misled me, whereas I’m exactly the same as I was.
But, however that may be, this is what I’ll do. The soldier
said he’d bring the money tomorrow morning. If you
bring it before him, Phaedria, I’ll follow my rule of first
pay, first served. Goodbye. (<span class="italic">he goes back into his house</span>)</p><p class="lineGroup noindent">

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">phae</span>
</span> What am I to do? Poor me, where can I find him the
money at such short notice, when I haven’t a penny to my
name? If only he could have been persuaded to give me
three days, it was all promised.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Geta</span>) Are we going to let him suffer like this, Geta,
when, according to what you said, he generously stood by
me just now? Why don’t we try to return the favour, now
he needs it?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Antipho</span>, <span class="italic">doubtfully</span>) I know that’s the right thing to do.</p></div>

<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> Come on then, you’re the only one who can save him.</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
