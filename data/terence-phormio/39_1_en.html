</span> As luck would have it, I’ve got the money with me now,
the income from my wife’s estates on Lemnos. I’ll take it
out of this, and tell my wife you needed it. (<span class="italic">they exit into

</span> What <span class="italic">have</span> you done?</p></div>

<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> I’ve tricked the old men out of their money.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> Is that all you’ve done?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> I don’t know, for god’s sake. It’s all I was told to do.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> Hey, you rogue, you’re not answering my question!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> Well, what <span class="italic">are</span> you talking about?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> What am I talking about? Without a shadow of doubt,
thanks to you all that’s left for me is the rope. May all
the gods and goddesses in heaven and hell destroy you
utterly! (<span class="italic">to the audience</span>, <span class="italic">ironically</span>) Look, if you want
anything done, entrust it to him, that is, if you really want
it seen to properly. (<span class="italic">to Geta</span>) What could have been more
disastrous than to touch on that sore spot and mention
my wife? You’ve encouraged my father to hope that she
can be pushed out. And tell me the next step. If Phormio
accepts the dowry, he has to marry her: what happens then?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> But he won’t marry her.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">with bitter irony</span>) Of course not. And, when they ask for
the money back, I suppose he’ll choose to go to jail for my sake.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
