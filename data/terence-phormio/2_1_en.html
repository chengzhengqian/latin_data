had set up a competition in compliments, he would have received
compliments himself; he must realise that he has been
repaid in kind for what he himself started. I will now refrain
from talking about him, though he himself does not refrain
from doing wrong.</p>
<p>Now listen carefully to what I want to say. I bring you a
new comedy which is called in Greek “The Claimant”; its Latin

will be the trickster<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_15_9" id="target_note_LCL023_15_9">

</a> Phormio, through whom most of the action
will be carried out, if the playwright has the benefit of your
good will.</p>
<p>Pay attention, and listen in silence with open minds, so that
we do not suffer the same fate as we suffered when our company
was driven from the stage by an uproar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_15_10a" id="target_note_LCL023_15_10a">

</a> Now we are
restored to the stage by the courage of our producer, supported
by your goodness and your sense of fair play.</p>
