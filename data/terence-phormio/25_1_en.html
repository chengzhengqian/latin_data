</span> Let’s come to the point; we’ve wasted enough words. If
you don’t take the woman away and quickly, I’ll throw her
out. That’s my last word, Phormio.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pho</span>
</span> If you lay a hand on her, against what is proper for a free
woman, I’ll bring a massive lawsuit against you. That’s <span class="italic">my</span>
last word, Demipho. (<span class="italic">to Geta</span>) Listen, if I’m needed for
anything, I’ll be at home.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> I understand. (<span class="italic">Phormio exits right in the direction of his
House</span>)</p></div>

<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) How much worry and anxiety my son is causing
me by getting me and him entangled in this marriage!
And he doesn’t even show his face so that at least I could
find out what he has to say about it and what his feelings
are. (<span class="italic">to Geta</span>)Go and see if he’s returned home yet or not.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>

<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">turning to his advisers</span>, <span class="italic">who have been lurking in the
Background</span>) You see the situation. What do I do? Speak, Hegio.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">heg</span>
</span> Me? I suggest Cratinus, if that’s all right with you.</p></div>

<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> Speak, Cratinus.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cra</span>
</span> You mean me?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> Yes, you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">cra</span>
</span> I would want you to do what is to your advantage. In my
opinion it is right and proper for what your son did in
your absence to be rendered null and void. And you’ll
win your case. That is my advice.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> Now you, Hegio.</p></div>

<span class="sc">heg</span>
</span> I’m sure that he (<span class="italic">pointing to Cratinus</span>) has given you
excellent advice. But the truth is, there are as many opinions
as there are people; everyone has his own way of
