</span> Can anything be more outrageous? It’s only when they’re
with their wives that they’re elderly. (<span class="italic">to Demipho</span>) Demipho,
I appeal to you: I’m sick of talking to him. Were
these his frequent journeys to Lemnos and his lengthy
stays there? Was this the slump in prices that reduced our income?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> Nausistrata, I don’t deny that he’s to blame in all this. But
isn’t it something that can be forgiven?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pho</span>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> He didn’t do it out of disregard or dislike of you. He
forced himself on the poor woman when he was drunk,
some fifteen years ago, and the girl was born. But he
never touched her after that. The mother’s now dead,
