</span> Why not?</p></div>

</span> I was told that her mother felt I was staying here too long,
and the girl was of an age where she couldn’t wait for me
to act; so she set out with her whole household to come
and find me.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> Why then, if I may ask, did you stay there so long, once
you’d heard the news?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> I fell ill, for heaven’s sake, and that kept me there.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> What illness? How did you catch it?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> You don’t need to ask. Old age is an illness in itself. But I
heard from the sailor who brought them over that they
arrived safely.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Have you heard what’s happened to my son in my absence, Chremes?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> Yes, and it’s left me uncertain what to do. If I offer the
match to an outsider, I shall have to explain from beginning
to end how she comes to be my daughter. In your
case I knew I could depend on your loyalty as on my own.
But, if an outsider wants to ally with our family, he’ll keep
the secret only so long as he and I are on good terms; if we
fall out, he’ll know more than he ought to know. And I’m
afraid my wife may find out by some means. If that happens,
I’ve no option but to clear out and leave home. I’m
the only one of my possessions I can call my own.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> I know your situation and it worries me, and I won’t
slacken in my efforts until I’ve achieved what I promised you.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
