</span> Were you afraid that, once I’d given an undertaking, I
wouldn’t stand by it? Listen, however poor I may be, I’ve
always taken care to be a man of my word.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">ironically</span>) Isn’t he the perfect gentleman, just as I said?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> Absolutely.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> And so I’ve come, Demipho, to announce that I’m ready.
You can hand over my bride as soon as you like. I’ve put
off all my other business, as was only proper once I’d
realised you were so set on the marriage.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> But he’s persuaded me (<span class="italic">indicating Chremes</span>) not to give
you the girl. “What will people say,” he said “if you do
this? Before, when you could have given her away honourably,
you didn’t. It would be a scandal to push her out
now.” He raised more or less the same objections as you
did just now when we were talking.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_119_66" id="target_note_LCL023_119_66">

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pho</span>
</span> You’re making a fool of me in a pretty high-handed way.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> How do you mean?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pho</span>
</span> As if you didn’t know! Because I won’t be able to marry
the other girl either. How am I going to go back and face
her, after treating her with such contempt?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">chr</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Demipho</span>, <span class="italic">in a whisper</span>) Say “Besides, I find that Antipho
is unwilling to part with her.”</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dem</span>
</span> Besides, I find that my son is unwilling to part with the
girl. But come over to the forum, if you will, Phormio,
and have the money returned to my account.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note text" id="note_LCL023_119_905"><sup class="lineRef">905</sup>
