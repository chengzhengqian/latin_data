against you, pretending that I’m a friend of the girl’s
father. We’ll go to court. As for her father’s identity and
her mother’s and her precise relationship to you, I’ll invent
the details to suit my interest and advantage. Since

father will return and it’s trouble for me, but I don’t care:
the girl will be ours.”</p></div>

</span> I suppose I’ll go and find someone to plead for me along
