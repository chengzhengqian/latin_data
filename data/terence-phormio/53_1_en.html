delighted. (<span class="italic">Geta escorts Antipho into Demipho’s house</span>)</p><p class="lineGroup noindent">

Now I have the perfect opportunity to fool the old men
and relieve Phaedria’s financial worries, so he won’t need
to go begging to any of his friends. This sum of money,
now that it’s been handed over, will be his to keep,
whether they like it or not. I’ve found a way to force their
hand, given the situation. Now I must put on a new face
and change my role. But I’ll withdraw into this nearby alley,
and appear to them from there when they come out.
I’m cancelling my pretended trip to the market. (<span class="italic">he exits

</span> I’m very grateful to the gods, brother, for the success of
our venture, and I pay them the thanks that are due. Now
we must meet Phormio as soon as possible, to get back
our thirty minas before he squanders them.</p></div>
