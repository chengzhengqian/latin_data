</span> When you’ve finished, come over to my wife and ask her
to see the girl before she leaves. We don’t want her to fly
into a rage. Tell her to say we’re giving her to Phormio to
marry; he’s a more suitable husband in that he’s more one
of the family. Also that we haven’t neglected our duty, but
have given him the dowry he asked for in full.</p></div>

</span> It matters a lot, Demipho. It’s not enough to do your duty
if popular opinion doesn’t approve what you’ve done. I
want this to be done with her own consent, so that she
won’t claim she was forced out.</p></div>
