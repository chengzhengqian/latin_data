</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Well, before she forgives him, I must look after
my own interests and Phaedria’s. (<span class="italic">aloud</span>) Hey, Nausistrata,
before you give him a hasty answer, listen.</p></div>

</span> I got thirty minas out of him by a trick and gave them to
your son. He’s given them to a pimp to buy his mistress.</p></div>

</span> What! What are you saying?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">nau</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Chremes</span>) Does it seem so shocking to you, if your son
at his age has one mistress, when you have two wives?
Have you no shame? How will you have the face to rebuke
him? Answer me that.</p></div>

</span> He’ll do as you wish.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">nau</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">to Chremes</span>) No. To make my position clear, I do not forgive
you, nor do I make any promises, nor will I give you
my answer before I’ve seen our son. I leave everything to
him to decide; I’ll do what he says.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> You are a wise woman, Nausistrata.</p></div>

</span> Indeed. I come out of this very well. It’s a fair result and
better than I could have hoped.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_135_73" id="target_note_LCL023_135_73">

home (compare line 586), so that this is a relatively favourable outcome
for Chremes. The MSS in fact give this line to Phormio, who has
achieved the humbling of Chremes, but it is not clear how Nausistrata’s
decision is “better than he could have hoped.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL023_135_73').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
