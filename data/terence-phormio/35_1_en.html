</span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) I’ve never set eyes on a craftier man than
Phormio. I went to see him to say that we needed money
and ask how it could be found. I was scarcely halfway
through and he’d grasped the situation. He was delighted,
he congratulated me, he asked where the old
man was, and he thanked the gods that he was being
granted the opportunity to show himself as good a friend
to Phaedria as he’d been to Antipho. I told him to wait for
me in the forum, and I’d bring the old man there. (<span class="italic">suddenly
noticing Demipho</span>) But there he is in person. Who’s
that beside him? Oh no! Phaedria’s father’s back. (<span class="italic">composing
himself with difficulty</span>) But why did I get into a
panic, dumb creature? Just because I’m presented with
two people to trick instead of one? In my opinion it’s
better to have two strings to my bow. I’ll try the one I targeted
in the first place. If he pays up, that’s fine. If I get
nothing from him, then I’ll tackle the new arrival.</p><p class="lineGroup noindent">

standing there with my father. Oh dear! I dread to think
