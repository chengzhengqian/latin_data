curtainless theatre signifies to the audience the end of the play. In the
MSS this request is preceded by the Greek letter omega, of which the
significance is not at all clear. It is implied by Horace <span class="italic">Ars Poetica</span> 155
(<span class="italic">donec cantor ‘vos plaudite’ dicat</span>) that the final <span class="italic">plaudit</span> was spoken by
the <span class="italic">cantor</span> (singer), perhaps the musician who accompanied the play,
but there is no other evidence to corroborate this. It is more likely that
it was spoken either by all the onstage actors, as in several plays of
Plautus’, signified in the MSS by <span class="italic">grex</span> or <span class="italic">caterva</span>, or by one of the characters
(here presumably Phormio), as in the rest of Plautus’ plays.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL023_137_74').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
