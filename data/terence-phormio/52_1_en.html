“Sophrona has just brought in the old man’s brother
Chremes,” he said “and he’s now in there with them.”
When I heard that, I continued towards the doors on tiptoe
without making a sound. I reached them, stood still,
held my breath, and listened. I strained my ears like this
(<span class="italic">cupping his ear</span>), trying to catch their conversation.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pho</span>
</span> Well done, Geta!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> And then I heard the most glorious news. God knows, I
nearly cried out for joy.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> What was it?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> What do you think?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> I’ve no idea.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> Well, it’s the most marvellous news. Your uncle has been
recognised as your wife’s father.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> What! What are you saying?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> He had a secret affair with her mother on Lemnos long ago.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">pho</span>
</span> You’re dreaming! So she didn’t know her own father?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> You can be sure there’s an explanation, Phormio. You
can’t expect me to have picked up everything they were
discussing inside from outside the door.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">ant</span>
</span> (<span class="italic">aside</span>) For god’s sake, I heard something about that story too.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> And here’s something else which will convince you. Presently
your uncle came outside here, and soon after that
he went back in again with your father. They both said
you were given permission to have her as your wife. And
lastly I was sent to find you and take you to them.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
