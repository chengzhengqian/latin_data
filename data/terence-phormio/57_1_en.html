</span> (<span class="italic">angrily</span>) Hey, is he going to make off with all that money
and laugh in our faces? By god, I’d rather die! Now show
yourself a man and keep your wits about you. As you can
see, your misconduct’s out, and you can’t hide it from
your wife any longer. In this situation you’re more likely
to win her over if we tell her ourselves what she is going
to hear from others. Then we’ll be able to pay this filthy
scoundrel back in our own way.</p></div>

the woman who bore your child has passed away.</p></div>

</span> (<span class="italic">returning to them</span>) Is this how you’re going to deal
with me? A pretty cunning plan of attack! (<span class="italic">to Demipho</span>)
By god, you haven’t done <span class="italic">him</span> much good (<span class="italic">pointing
to Chremes</span>) by provoking me, Demipho. (<span class="italic">to Chremes</span>)
Answer me. When you took your pleasure overseas and
had no scruples about insulting your excellent wife in this
unheard of way, do you now come with prayers to wash
away your sins? I’ll incense her so much by what I’m going
to tell her that you won’t be able to put out the fire
even if you dissolve into tears.</p></div>

</span> May all the gods and goddesses damn him! How can a
man be possessed of such effrontery? The villain should
be deported to some deserted land at public expense.</p></div>
