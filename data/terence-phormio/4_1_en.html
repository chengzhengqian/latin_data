</span> Come off it, you idiot! When you’ve found a man honest
over money, are you afraid to trust him with words? What
would I gain by betraying you?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Davos, you know our old man’s older brother Chremes?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>

</span> It so happened that both the old men went overseas at
the same time, Chremes to Lemnos, and our old man to a
longstanding friend in Cilicia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_19_15" id="target_note_LCL023_19_15">

</a> who enticed him there
by letters promising him practically a mountain of gold.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> When he had wealth enough and to spare?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> Never mind! That’s his nature.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> Oh! If only I’d been a rich man!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> When the two old men went away, they left me behind
here as a sort of guardian for their sons.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> That was a tough assignment, Geta.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">get</span>
</span> So I found out, I can tell you. I recall the gods were
against me from the day the old men left. I stood up to
the boys at first. Need I say more? Loyalty to the old man
proved a disaster to my shoulder blades.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">
<span class="sc">dav</span>
</span> That’s just what I was thinking. It’s folly to kick against
the pricks.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_19_16" id="target_note_LCL023_19_16">
