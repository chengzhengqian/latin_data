</span> Ah! Not so. I’ve tested the ground, and I can see where to
put my feet. How many men do you think I’ve beaten to
the point of death, foreigners and citizens? The more
practice I get, the more often I do it. Tell me, now, have
you ever heard of a case being brought against me for assault?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">

</span> But why’s that?</p></div>

</span> Because nobody sets nets for harmful birds like hawks or
kites. They set them for harmless birds, because there’s
profit in them, whereas with the others you’re wasting
your time. People who offer some sort of plucking are at
risk from various quarters, but they know I’ve got nothing.
You’ll say: “They’ll get you convicted and haul you off
home.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_49_33" id="target_note_LCL023_49_33">

</a> But they don’t want to feed a man with an appetite
like mine, and they’re wise in my opinion if they
refuse to do me a good turn in return for a bad one.</p></div>

</span> On the contrary, it’s the patron who can’t be thanked
enough for his services. You come oiled and washed from
the baths, without contributing a thing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_49_34" id="target_note_LCL023_49_34">

</a> and without a
care in the world, while he’s consumed with worry and
expense. Everything’s done to satisfy your desires, while
he can only gnash his teeth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL023_49_35" id="target_note_LCL023_49_35">

</a> You laugh, you take the first
drink and the first place at table, and then this problematical
meal is laid before you.</p></div>
