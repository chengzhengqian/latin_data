</span> There’s nothing, Antipho, that can’t be made worse in the
telling. You’re omitting the good things and mentioning
only the bad. Now listen to the other side. Once he takes
the money, he has to marry the girl, as you say: I grant you
that. But there will after all be a breathing space while
he prepares the wedding, invites the guests, and performs
the sacrifices. Meanwhile Phaedria’s friends will
bring what they promised, and Phormio will pay back the
money out of that.</p></div>

out all right.</p></div>
