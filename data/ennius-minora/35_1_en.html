<p class="noindent">Bodily pleasures, then, are transient: each in turn evaporates, leaving cause for regret more often than for recollection. Thus Africanus must be counted happier [than Sardanapalus] when he addresses his country in this way:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">cease, Rome, your enemies . . .</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and the rest brilliantly:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_289_1" id="target_note_LCL537_289_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">for my labors have brought forth a great monument for you</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">He delights in his past labors, whereas you [Torquatus, the Epicurean] bid us dwell upon our past pleasures; and he recalls experiences that never had any connection with the body, but you are completely concerned with the body.</p>

<p class="noindent">This is an effective way to ornament a speech and should often be adopted.</p>
