whenever he came into each region, he bound the kings or leaders of their peoples to him in hospitality and friendship, and whenever he left each, he ordered a shrine to be set up for him in the name of his host, as if a memory of friendship and alliance could be preserved. [23] Thus temples to Jupiter Ataburius, to Jupiter Labryandius were founded: for Ataburus and Labryandus were his hosts and supporters in war; likewise to Jupiter Laprius, to Jupiter Molio, to Jupiter Casius and other temples that are named in this way.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_259_1" id="target_note_LCL537_259_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He devised this very cleverly, so that he could acquire divine honor for himself and a perpetual name for his hosts connected with religious cult. [24] Therefore they were happy and followed his orders willingly and celebrated annual rituals and festivities for the sake of their names. [25] In Sicily Aeneas did something similar, when he bestowed on the town being founded the name of his host Acestes, so that later Acestes, happily and willingly, would love, expand and beautify it [cf. Verg. <span class="italic">Aen.</span> 5.708–78]. [26] In this way Jupiter sowed the religious celebration of his cult all over the world and gave others an example to imitate.
