<p class="noindent">We are not permitted to force a separation between vowels, even should we wish to do so. Those famous, though slightly uncouth speeches of Cato themselves illustrate this; all the poets illustrate this except those who for metrical reasons often permitted hiatus, for example Naevius [<span class="italic">Trag.</span> 65 R.<sup>2–3</sup> = F 41 <span class="italic">TrRF</span>] . . . and again [<span class="italic">Trag. </span>64 R.<sup>2–3</sup> = F 42 <span class="italic">TrRF</span>] . . . , but Ennius uses it only once:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Invincible Scipio!</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">. . . [153] Our poets would not very often have tolerated this thing, which the Greeks are actually accustomed to praise.</p>

<p class="noindent">The grammarian Valerius Probus stood out in his day [later 1st century AD] for learning. [2] He pronounced “Hannibal” and “Hasdrubal” and “Hamilcar” by lengthening the next to last syllable, and there is a letter from him written to Marcellus, in which he claims that Plautus and Ennius and many other ancients pronounced it this way. [3] He nevertheless cites only one verse of Ennius alone, from the book entitled <span class="italic">Scipio.</span> [4] I have appended that verse below, created as a <span class="italic">versus quadratus </span>[lit., “square verse,” a trochaic septenarius] in which, unless the third syllable of Hannibal’s name is lengthened, the rhythm will limp. The verse of Ennius he quoted runs thus: [5]</p>
