<p class="noindent">“grim” is a deft substitution for “bitter,” like “grim lupine.” [Verg. <span class="italic">G.</span> 1.75]. So too Ennius in his fourth book of <span class="italic">Satires</span>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent5">he seeks neither the grim mustard</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">nor the mournful onion</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent">“You come without a contribution, oiled and washed from the baths, / entirely at ease, while he is consumed with worry and expense! / While things go your way, he gnashes his teeth.

The manuscripts of Donatus preserve the following lines as prose: their reconstruction as iambic senarii is problematic. See Welsh 2013. Only four books of satires are otherwise attested (T 40b): either Donatus or his text is likely in error. </a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL537_277_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
