 Titan, who was less handsome than Saturn, for that reason and because he saw that his mother and sisters were making an effort for Saturn to reign, yielded to him so that he reigned. And so he made an agreement with Saturn, that if any male offspring were born to him, he would not bring him up. That he did for this reason, so that the kingdom would return to his own sons. Then they killed the son who was the first to be born to Saturn. Then later twins were born, Jupiter and Juno. Then they gave Saturn Juno to see and secretly hid Jupiter and gave him to Vesta to bring him up, concealing him from Saturn. Likewise Ops bears Neptune in secret from Saturn and hides him secretly. In the same way in a third<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_253_1" id="target_note_LCL537_253_1"><sup>1</sup></a> birth Ops bears twins, Pluto and Glauca. Pluto is in Latin Dis pater, others call him Orcus. There they show the daughter Glauca to Saturn, but hide the son Pluto and conceal him. Then Glauca dies as a young girl. This, as is written, is the origin and kinship of Jupiter and his brothers: in this way it was handed down to us from the <span class="italic">Sacred Writing</span> [= <span class="italic">Sacred History</span>].<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_253_2a" id="target_note_LCL537_253_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Then Titan, after he found out that sons had been begotten by Saturn and brought up in secret from him, led away with him his own sons, who are called Titans, and seized his brother Saturn and Ops and surrounded them by a wall and set a guard over them.</p></blockquote>
