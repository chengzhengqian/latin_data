The ancient author Euhemerus, who was from the community of Messene, collected the deeds of Jupiter and others who are regarded as gods and composed a history from the commemorative tablets and sacred inscriptions that are found in the most ancient temples and particularly in the shrine of Jupiter Triphylius, where a commemorative tablet showed that a golden column had been put in place by Jupiter himself on which he recorded his achievements, to be a memorial of his deeds for posterity. [34] This history was translated and recounted by Ennius. His words are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>where Jupiter gives Neptune command over the sea so that he would rule over all islands and all places that were along the sea</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In this period Jupiter used to spend the greatest part of his life on Mount Olympus, and there they came to him for legal procedures if any matters were controversial. Likewise, if anyone had found out anything new that was useful to human life, they came there and showed it to Jupiter.</p></blockquote>
