<p class="noindent">This, at any rate, is Aesop’s fable about trust in friends and relatives being usually idle and in vain.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_279_1" id="target_note_LCL537_279_1"><sup>1</sup></a> . . .

<blockquote><p><span class="line">Always have this moral ready to hand:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Don’t expect anything from friends that you yourself can do.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
