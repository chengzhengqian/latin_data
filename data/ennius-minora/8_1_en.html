<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">a</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Tusculan Disputations</span></p>
<p class="noindent">And this can also be concluded in the following way: neither in a wretched life is there anything deserving of renown or worthy of glory nor in one that is neither wretched nor happy. And in some lives there is something deserving of renown and worthy of glory and to be put on display, like Epaminondas: “by our counsels the glory of the Lacedaemonians was trimmed,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_235_1" id="target_note_LCL537_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a> like Africanus:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">from the sun rising over the marches of Maeotis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_235_2" id="target_note_LCL537_235_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">there is nobody who can become equal in deeds</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">If it exists, a happy life is worthy of glory and deserving of renown and to be put on display; for there is nothing else that is deserving of renown and to be put on display.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">b</span> Lactantius, <span class="italic">Divine Institutions</span></p>
<p class="noindent">If anyone has killed a single person, he is regarded as polluted and a scoundrel, and they believe it is not right that he be admitted to this earthly dwelling place of the gods. But he who has killed countless thousands of men, flooded fields with blood and dyed rivers is admitted not only into the sacred building, but also into heaven. [11] In Ennius, Africanus speaks thus [Cic. <span class="italic">Rep.</span> F inc. 2 Powell]:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">if it is allowed for anyone to ascend to the realms of the heaven dwellers,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">for me alone heaven’s greatest gate lies open</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
