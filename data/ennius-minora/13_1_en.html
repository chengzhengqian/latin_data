<p class="noindent">Therefore, if we understand that, both on account of his deeds and on account of his character, Jupiter was a human being and reigned on earth, it remains for us to investigate his death as well. [45] Ennius in the <span class="italic">Sacred History</span>, after having described everything that he did in his life, toward the end says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then after Jupiter had walked round the earth five times and had distributed power among all his friends and relatives and left human beings laws and customs and provided grain and did many other good things, he was stirred by the immortal glory of his memory and left eternal monuments of himself. [46] After his life fell into decline, he passed away on Crete and went away to join the gods, and the Curetes, his sons, cared for him and honored him; and his sepulcher is on Crete in the town of Knossos, and Vesta is said to have created this town;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_245_1" id="target_note_LCL537_245_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and on his sepulcher there is inscribed in ancient Greek letters “Zeus, son of Kronos,” which is in Latin “Jupiter, son of Saturnus.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">[47] This at any rate is not what the poets transmit, but the writers about events from the past.</p>
