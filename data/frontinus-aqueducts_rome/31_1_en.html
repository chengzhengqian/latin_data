A gauging of this aqueduct could not be taken at the intake, since there it consists of two channels. But at The Twins, which is below Spes Vetus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_391_1" id="target_note_LCL174_391_1"><sup>1</sup></a> where it joins with a branch of Augusta, I found a depth of water of 5 feet, and a width of 1¾ feet, making an area of 8¾ square feet,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_391_2a" id="target_note_LCL174_391_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> twenty-two 100-pipes plus a 40-pipe, which makes 1,825 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>,—more than the records have it by 984 <span class="italic">quinariae.</span> It was delivering 704 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>,—137 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> less than credited in the records; and, furthermore, 1,121 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> less than given by the gauging at The Twins.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_391_3" id="target_note_LCL174_391_3"><sup>3</sup></a> A considerable amount of this, however, is lost by leaks in the conduit, which, being deeply buried, does not clearly exhibit them. And yet their presence is plainly indicated by the fact that in very many parts of the City excellent water is met with, which leaks from that aqueduct. But we also detected some illicit pipes within the City. Outside the City, however, on account of the depth of the level, which at the intake is 50 feet underground, the conduit suffers no depredations.</p>
<p>Old Anio is credited in the records with the amount of 1,541 <span class="italic">quinariae.</span> At the intake I found 4,398 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, exclusive of the quantity which is
