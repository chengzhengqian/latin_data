These works Claudius completed on the most magnificent scale,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_355_2" id="target_note_LCL174_355_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and dedicated in the consulship of Sulla and Titianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_355_3" id="target_note_LCL174_355_3"><sup>3</sup></a> on the 1st of August in the year 803<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_355_4" id="target_note_LCL174_355_4"><sup>4</sup></a> after the founding of the City.

Claudia also receives the spring which is called Albudinus, which is of such excellence that, when Marcia, too, needs supplementing, this water answers the purpose so admirably that by its addition there is no change in Marcia’s quality. The spring of Augusta was turned into Claudia, because it was plainly evident that Marcia was of sufficient volume by itself. But Augusta remained, nevertheless, a reserve supply to Marcia, the understanding being that Augusta should run into Claudia only when the conduit of Marcia would not carry it.
