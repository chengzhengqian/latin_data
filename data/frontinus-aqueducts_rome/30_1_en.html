<p><span class="sc">Having</span> detailed those facts which it was necessary to state with reference to the ajutages, I will now set down what discharge each aqueduct, according to the imperial records, was thought to have up to the time of my administration, and also how much it actually did deliver; then the true measure, which I reached by careful investigation, acting on the suggestion of that best and most industrious emperor, Nerva.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_389_1" id="target_note_LCL174_389_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now there were, in the aggregate, 12,755 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> set down in the records,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_389_2" id="target_note_LCL174_389_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but 14,018 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> actually delivered; that is, 1,263 more <span class="italic">quinariae were</span> reported as delivered than were reckoned as received.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_389_3" id="target_note_LCL174_389_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Since I considered it the most important function of my office to determine the facts concerning the water-supply, my astonishment at this state of affairs stirred me profoundly and led me to investigate how it happened that more was being delivered than belonged to the property, so to speak. Accordingly, I first of all undertook measurements of the intakes of the conduits and discovered a total supply far greater—that is, by about 10,000 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>—than I found in the records, as I shall explain in connection with each aqueduct.</p>
<p>In the records Appia is credited with 841 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_389_4a" id="target_note_LCL174_389_4a"><sup>4</sup></a>
