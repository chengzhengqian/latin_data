<p>Julia is credited in the records with a measure of 649 <span class="italic">quinariae.</span> At the intake the gaugings could not be made, because the intake is composed of several tributaries. But at the sixth mile-stone from the City, Julia is wholly taken into the settling reservoir, at which place its volume, according to the plainly visible gauges, amounts to 1,206 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>,—more than set down in the records by 557 <span class="italic">quinariae.</span> Besides this, near the City, behind the Gardens of Pallas, it receives from Claudia 162 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, making the whole number of <span class="italic">quinariae</span> received by Julia 1,368. Of this amount, it discharges 190 into Tepula, and delivers on its own account 803 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>; from this we get a total of 993 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> which it delivers,—more than the records credit by 344 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>; less than we set it down as having at the reservoir by 213, which is precisely the amount we found diverted by those who were taking water without grant from the sovereign.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_397_2a" id="target_note_LCL174_397_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
