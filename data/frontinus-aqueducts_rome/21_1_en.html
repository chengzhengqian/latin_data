employed, whenever several <span class="italic">quinariae</span> are delivered by one pipe and received in a reservoir, from which consumers receive their individual supply,—this being done in order that the conduit may not be tapped too often.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_371_1" id="target_note_LCL174_371_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The second principle is followed, whenever the pipe does not increase according to some necessary multiple of <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, but according to the size of diameters, in conformity with which principle they enlarge their capacity and receive their names; as for example, when a quarter [of a digit] is added to the diameter of a <span class="italic">quinaria</span>, we get as a result the <span class="italic">senaria</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_371_2a" id="target_note_LCL174_371_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> but its capacity is not increased by a whole <span class="italic">quinaria</span>, for it contains a <span class="italic">quinaria</span> plus ⁵⁄₁₂ plus ¹⁄₄₈. So on, by adding successive quarters of a digit to the diameter, as was said above, we get by gradual increases, a 7-pipe (<span class="italic">septenaria</span>), an 8-pipe (<span class="italic">octonaria</span>), and up to the 20-pipe (<span class="italic">vicenaria</span>).</p>
<p>After that<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_371_3" id="target_note_LCL174_371_3"><sup>3</sup></a> we have the method of gauging which is based on the number of square digits contained in the cross-section, that is, the orifice of each ajutage, from which number of square digits the pipes also get their names. Thus those which in cross-section, that is, in circular orifice, have 25 square digits, are called 25-pipes. Similarly we have the 30-pipe (<span class="italic">tricenaria</span>), and so on, by a regular increase of 5 square digits, up to the 120-pipe.</p>
<p>In the case of the 20-pipe, which is on the border line between the two methods of gauging,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_371_4" id="target_note_LCL174_371_4"><sup>4</sup></a> the two methods almost coincide. For according to the
