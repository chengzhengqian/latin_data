similarly a <span class="italic">modius</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_377_1" id="target_note_LCL174_377_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to both a <span class="italic">cyathus</span> and <span class="italic">sextarius</span>, so also the multiplication of the <span class="italic">quinariae</span> in case of the larger ajutages must follow a regular progression. However, when less is found in the delivery ajutages and more in the receiving ajutages, it is obvious that there is not error, but fraud.</p>
<p>Let us remember that every stream of water, whenever it comes from a higher point and flows into a reservoir after a short run, not only comes up to its measure, but actually yields a surplus; but whenever it comes from a lower point, that is, under less pressure, and is conducted a longer distance, it shrinks in volume, owing to the resistance of its conduit; and that, therefore, on this principle it needs either a check or a help in its discharge.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_377_2" id="target_note_LCL174_377_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>But the position of the <span class="italic">calix</span> is also a factor. Placed at right angles and level, it maintains the normal quantity. Set against the current of the water, and sloping downward, it will take in more. If it slopes to one side, so that the water flows by, and if it is inclined with the current, that is, is less favourably placed for taking in water, it will receive the water slowly and in scant quantity. The <span class="italic">calix</span>, now, is a bronze ajutage, inserted into a conduit or reservoir, and to it the service pipes are attached. Its length ought not to be less than 12 digits, while its orifice ought to have such capacity as is specified.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_377_3" id="target_note_LCL174_377_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Bronze seems to have been selected, since, being hard, it is more difficult to bend, and is not easily expanded or contracted.</p>
<p>I have described below all the 25 ajutages that there are (although only 15 of them are in use), gauging them according to the method of computation
