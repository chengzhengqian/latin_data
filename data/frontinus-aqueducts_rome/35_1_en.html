at the intake, because Virgo is made up of several tributaries, and enters its channels with too slow a current. Near the City, however, at the seventh mile-stone, on the land which now belongs to Cejonius Commodus, where Virgo has a greater velocity, I made a gauging, and it amounted to 2,504 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>,—1,852 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> more than was set down in the records. The correctness of our gauging is very easily proved; for Virgo discharges all the <span class="italic">quinariae</span> which we found by gauging, that is, 2,504.</p>
<p>The measure of the capacity of Alsietina is not set down in the records, nor could it be accurately arrived at under present conditions, because [it receives] from Lake Alsietinus, and afterwards in the vicinity of Careiae from Sabatinus as much water as the water-men arrange for. Alsietina delivers 392 <span class="italic">quinariae.</span></p>
<p>Claudia, flowing more abundantly than the others, is especially exposed to depredation. In the records it is credited with only 2,855 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, although I found at the intake 4,607 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>,—1,752 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> more than are recorded. Our gauging, however, is confirmed by the fact that at the seventh mile-stone from the City, at the settling reservoir, where the gauging is without question, we find 3,312 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>,—457 more than are recorded, although, before reaching the reservoir, not only are deliveries made, to satisfy private grants, but also, as we detected, a great deal is taken secretly, and therefore 1,295 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> less are found than there really ought to be. Moreover, in the delivery of the water also it is manifest that there is fraud, since the amount actually delivered does not agree either with the statements of the records or with the gaugings </p></section><notes></notes></section>
