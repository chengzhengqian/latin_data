the following ajutages also up to the 20-pipe, the diameter of each pipe increasing by the addition of ¼ of a digit. For example the 6-pipe is six quarters in diameter, a 7-pipe seven quarters, and so on by a uniform increase up to a 20-pipe.</p>
<p>Every ajutage, now, is gauged either by its diameter or circumference, or by its area of clear cross-section, from any of which factors its capacity becomes evident. That we may distinguish the more readily between the inch ajutage, the square digit, the circular digit, and the <span class="italic">quinaria</span> itself, use must be made of the value of the <span class="italic">quinaria</span>, the ajutage which is most accurately determined and best known. Now the inch ajutage, has a diameter of 1⅓ digits.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_369_1" id="target_note_LCL174_369_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Its capacity is [slightly] more than 1⅛ <span class="italic">quinariae, i.e.</span> 1½ twelfths of a <span class="italic">quinaria</span> plus ³⁄₂₈₈ plus ⅔ of ¹⁄₂₈₈ more. The square digit, reduced to the circle is 1 digit plus 1½ twelfths of a digit plus ¹⁄₇₂ in diameter; its capacity is ¹⁰⁄₁₂ of a <span class="italic">quinaria.</span> The circular digit is 1 digit in diameter; its capacity is ⁷⁄₁₂ plus ½ twelfth plus ¹⁄₇₂ of a <span class="italic">quinaria.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_369_2a" id="target_note_LCL174_369_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Now the ajutages which are derived from the <span class="italic">quinaria</span> increase on two principles. One principle is that the <span class="italic">quinaria</span> itself is taken a given number of times, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> in one orifice the equivalent of several <span class="italic">quinariae</span> is included, in which case the size of the orifice increases according to the increase in the number of <span class="italic">quinariae.</span> This principle is regularly

 He also uses Sescuncia, 1½ × ¹⁄₁₂, (or ⅛); Duella, ¹⁄₃₀; Sicilicus, ¹⁄₄₈; and Sextula, ¹⁄₇₂;
and depends on combinations of these to express exact terms. Owing to corruptions in text, Frontinus’s figures are often at variance with obvious facts.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_369_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
