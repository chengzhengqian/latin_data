quantity which is computed at the reservoir from the gauges set up there, along with what is carried around the reservoir and received in the same channel on arches, is 2,944 <span class="italic">quinariae.</span> The aggregate of what is delivered above the reservoir or is received on arches is 3,295 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>,—more than is set down in the scheduled capacity by 1,133 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, and less than given by the gaugings made at the intake by 1,395 <span class="italic">quinariae.</span> After passing the reservoir, it delivered 1,840 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>,—227 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> less than we said was set down in the scheduled capacity, and 1,104 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> less than is taken from the reservoir upon the arches. The aggregate of what was lost either between the intake and the reservoir or downstream from the reservoir, was 2,499 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, the diversion of which, as in case of the other aqueducts, we discovered at several places. For that there is no lack of water is manifest also from the fact that at the intake, besides the volume which we noted that we found from the capacity of the conduit, over 300 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> are wasted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_395_1" id="target_note_LCL174_395_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

In the following computations, Frontinus sometimes includes and sometimes disregards the amounts given to Tepula and Anio. (1) The measurements at the intake showed 4,690 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, the records credited 2,162 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, a discrepancy of 2,528 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>; (2) between the intake and the reservoir 351 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> were delivered (including those given to Tepula and Anio), and measurements at the reservoir showed 2,944 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, thus revealing a loss of 1,395 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> above the reservoir; (3) above and below the reservoir, there were delivered in all 95 plus 1,840 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> (this does <span class="italic">not</span> take account of the contributions to Tepula and Anio), 227 fewer <span class="italic">quinariae</span> than the amount credited in the records; and the amount delivered below the reservoir was 1,104 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> less than the amount measured at the reservoir. Since the amount at the intake was 4,690 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, and the total distribution (including the amounts given to Tepula and Anio) amounted to 2,191 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, there remained 2,499 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> still unaccounted for.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_395_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL174_395_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_395_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup><span class="italic">Cf.</span> 9, 19.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_395_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
