<p>It has seemed to me not inappropriate to include also a statement of the lengths of the channels of the several aqueducts, according to the kinds of construction.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_359_1" id="target_note_LCL174_359_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For since the chief function of this office of water-commissioner lies in their upkeep, the man in charge of them ought to know which of them demand the heavier outlay. My zeal was not satisfied with submitting details to examination; I also had plans made of the aqueducts, on which it is shown where there are valleys and how great these are; where rivers are crossed; and where conduits laid on hillsides demand more particular constant care for their maintenance and repair. By this provision, one reaps the advantage of being able to have the works before one’s eyes, so to speak, at a moment’s notice, and to consider them as though standing by their side.</p>
<p>The several aqueducts reach the City at different elevations. In consequence certain ones deliver water on higher ground, while others cannot rise to the loftier points; for the hills have gradually grown higher with rubbish in consequence of frequent conflagrations. There are five whose head rises to every point in the City, but of these some are forced up with greater, others with lesser pressure. The highest is New Anio; next comes Claudia; the third place is taken by Julia; the fourth by Tepula; the last by Marcia, although at its intake this mounts even to the level of Claudia. But the ancients laid the lines of their aqueducts at a lower elevation, either because they had not yet nicely worked out the art of levelling, or because they purposely sunk </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_359_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_359_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup><span class="italic">i.e.,</span> how much under ground; how much on arches, etc.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_359_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
