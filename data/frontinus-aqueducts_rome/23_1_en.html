<p>Thus by diminishing the size of the 20-pipe by which they constantly deliver, and enlarging the 100-and 120-pipes, by which they always receive, they steal in case of the 100-pipe 27 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, and in case of the 120-pipe 86 <span class="italic">quinariae.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_375_1" id="target_note_LCL174_375_1"><sup>1</sup></a> While this is proved by computation, it is also obvious from the facts. For from the 20-pipe, which Caesar rates<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_375_2" id="target_note_LCL174_375_2"><sup>2</sup></a> at 16 <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, they do not deliver more than 13; and it is equally certain that from the 100-pipe and the 120-pipe, which they have expanded, they deliver only up to a limited amount, since Caesar, as his records show, has made delivery according to his grant,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_375_3" id="target_note_LCL174_375_3"><sup>3</sup></a> when out of each 100-pipe he furnishes 81½ <span class="italic">quinariae</span>, and similarly out of a 120-pipe, 98.</p>
<p>In all there are 25 ajutages. They all conform to their computed and recorded capacities, barring these four which the water-men have altered. But everything embraced under the head of mensuration ought to be fixed, unchanged, and constant. For only so will any special computation accord with general principles.

Now, if the gain resulting from <span class="italic">selling</span> by short measure was 3⁷⁄₂₄ <span class="italic">quinariae</span> in one 20-pipe, it will have been 16¹¹⁄₂₄ <span class="italic">quinariae</span> in five 20-pipes (or one 100-pipe). In the same way, since the capacity of the 120-pipe is 97¾  <span class="italic">quinariae</span> (<span class="italic">cf.</span> 63), it is equal to six 20-pipes, and the gain in this case will have been 19¾ <span class="italic">quinariae.</span> But by the increase of the pipes through which they <span class="italic">receive</span> water (<span class="italic">cf.</span> 32), the gain was 10¹³⁄₂₄  <span class="italic">quinariae</span> in case of the 100-pipe, and 66¹⁄₆ <span class="italic">quinariae</span> in case of the 120-pipe; so that by adding the gains made at both ends of the bargain, we arrive at an aggregate gain of 27 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> in case of the 100-pipe, and of 85¹¹⁄₁₂, practically 86, <span class="italic">quinariae</span> in case of the 120-pipe.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_375_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_375_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_375_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup><span class="italic">Cf.</span> 31.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_375_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_375_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_375_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>Literally: “stops distributing, as though the ajutage had run dry.” Whoever wished to draw water for private uses had to seek for a grant and bring to the water-commissioner a writing from the sovereign (<span class="italic">cf.</span> 103, 105).
