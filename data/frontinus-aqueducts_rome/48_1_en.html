<p>To which authorities belonged the right to grant water or to sell it, is variously given even in the laws, for at times I find that the grant was made by the aediles, at other times by the censors; but it is apparent that as often as there were censors in the government<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_425_1" id="target_note_LCL174_425_1"><sup>1</sup></a> these grants were sought chiefly from them. If there were none, then the aediles had the power referred to. It is plain from this how much more our forefathers cared for the general good than for private luxury, inasmuch as even the water which private parties conducted was made to subserve the public interest.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_425_2" id="target_note_LCL174_425_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The care of the several aqueducts I find was regularly let out to contractors, and the obligation was imposed upon these of having a fixed number of slave workmen on the aqueducts outside the City, and another fixed number within the City; and of entering in the public records the names also of those whom they intended to employ in the service for each ward of the City. I find also that the duty of inspecting their work devolved at times on the aediles and censors, and at times on the quaestors, as may be seen from the resolution of the Senate which was passed in the consulate of Gaius Licinius and Quintus Fabius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_425_3a" id="target_note_LCL174_425_3a"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
