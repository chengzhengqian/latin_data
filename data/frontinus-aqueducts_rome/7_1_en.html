<p>Forty years after Appia was brought in, in the four hundred and eighty-first year<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_343_1" id="target_note_LCL174_343_1"><sup>1</sup></a> from the founding of the City, Manius Curius Dentatus, who held the censorship with Lucius Papirius Cursor, contracted to have the waters of what is now called Old<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_343_2" id="target_note_LCL174_343_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Anio brought into the City, with the proceeds of the booty captured from Pyrrhus. This was in the second consulship of Spurius Carvilius and Lucius Papirius. Then two years later the question of completing the aqueduct was discussed in the Senate on the motion . . . of the praetor.

The intake of Old Anio is above Tibur<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_343_3" id="target_note_LCL174_343_3"><sup>3</sup></a> at the twentieth milestone outside the . . .
