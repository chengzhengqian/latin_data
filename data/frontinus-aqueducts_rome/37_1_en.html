the records of delivery most of this water is actually accounted for? For it is stated that 4,200 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> are delivered,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_403_1" id="target_note_LCL174_403_1"><sup>1</sup></a> although elsewhere in the same records the amount taken in is put down as only 3,263. Besides this, I have discovered that not only 538 <span class="italic">quinariae</span> (the difference between our gauging and the recorded delivery) are stolen, but a far greater quantity. Whence it appears that the total found by me is none too large.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_403_2" id="target_note_LCL174_403_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The explanation of this is, that the swifter current of water, coming as it does from a large and rapidly flowing river, increases the volume by its very velocity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_403_3" id="target_note_LCL174_403_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I do not doubt that many will be surprised that according to our gaugings, the quantity of water was found to be much greater than that given in the imperial records.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL174_403_4a" id="target_note_LCL174_403_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> The reason for this is to be found

He accordingly compares streams of water merely by the area of their cross sections, and then worries himself into all sorts of explanations as to why his gaugings by areas, made irrespective of heads and velocities, do not balance. The frauds of the water-men, of the plumbers and of others who draw water unlawfully, always furnish a handy explanation, however.”—<span class="italic">Herschel.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL174_403_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL174_403_4a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL174_403_4a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>The following table will show how Frontinus arrived at the figures which he gives:— <i></i><table id="table5">
