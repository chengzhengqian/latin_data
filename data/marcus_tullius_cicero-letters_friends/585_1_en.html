making my motion. But all this did not affect me; I had other considerations more at heart. I was for the commonwealth, as always, and for your dignity and glory.</p>
<p>I hope you will redeem the pledge I gave in the Senate, at some length of discourse, and at the public meeting. I promised, indeed almost guaranteed, that you had not waited and would not wait for our decrees, but would defend the commonwealth on your own initiative in your wonted fashion. Although no news has yet reached us of your whereabouts and the forces at your disposal, I am resolved that all resources and troops in that part of the world are yours, and am confident that you have already recovered the province of Asia for the commonwealth. You must now surpass yourself in adding to your glory.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p>You must not think it at all strange that I have written nothing on public affairs since war broke out. The pass of Castulo, which has always held up my couriers, has become more dangerous than ever with increasing banditry. Even so, that does not cause nearly so much delay as the pickets posted everywhere by both sides, which examine couriers and stop them proceeding. Had not letters got through by sea, I should be totally ignorant of affairs in Rome. But now that the opening of navigation gives me the chance, I shall write to you most eagerly and as often as I can.</p>
