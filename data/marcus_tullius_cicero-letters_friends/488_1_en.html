ranks, we dreaded what each day might bring. However, his own distinction and the efforts of myself and his other erstwhile guests have carried the day. Caesar has acceded to our petitions in full, as you will gather from the letter which he has dispatched to you.</p>
<p>And now, far from at all abating my previous recommendation as though all our objectives were already achieved, I want to urge you all the more pressingly to take Lyso into your patronage and connection. When his fortunes hung in the balance, I was chary of saying too much to you in case of some mischance which even you would be powerless to remedy. But now that his status is secure, I most earnestly and particularly ask you for all possible assistance. Not to make a catalogue, I commend his whole household to your favour, including his young son, whom my client C. Maenius Gemellus adopted under the laws of Patrae, when he himself had become a citizen of that place during his unhappy exile. I trust that in this same matter of Maeniusâ€™ inheritance you will defend his cause and rights.</p>
<p>The capital point is that you should admit Lyso, whom I know to be an excellent and appreciative fellow, into your connection. If you do, I have no doubt that you will form a regard for him, and in due course recommend him to others with sentiments and judgement corresponding to my own. This I ardently desire. And I also have some apprehension that, if in any particular you appear to have done less for him than you conceivably might, he will suspect that the perfunctory style of my letters has been to blame rather than your unmindfulness of myself. For how much you think of me he has been able to perceive from your own letters as well as my day-to-day conversation.</p>
