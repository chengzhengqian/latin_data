doing my best to urge Lepidus too to come into the fold, and am promising him all manner of compliance, if only he chooses to remember his patriotic duty. As coadjutors and intermediaries in this matter I am employing my brother, Laterensis, and our friend Furnius. No private quarrels shall prevent me from cooperating with my worst enemy for the safety of the commonwealth. If these efforts turn out fruitless, none the less I am in excellent heart and perhaps I shall content you all with greater glory to myself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_261_3" id="target_note_LCL230_261_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Take care of your health and remember me kindly, as I do you.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Cornificius greetings.</p>
<p>You recommend to me P. Luccius, one of my own circle. I shall spare no pains to help him in any way I can.</p>
<p>We have lost our colleagues<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_261_1" id="target_note_LCL230_261_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Hirtius and Pansa at a very unfortunate moment. In their Consulship they gave good service to the commonwealth, which is now rid of Antonyâ€™s brigandage, but not yet completely out of the wood. If permitted, I shall fight the good fight as ever, though I am now very tired. But no weariness should stand in the way of duty and loyalty. Well, enough of that. I would rather you heard about me from others than from myself.</p>
<p>Of you we hear what we should most have wished to hear. There are some ugly rumours abroad about Cn. Minucius, whom you praised to the skies in one of your letters. I should be glad if you would let me know the facts, and how things are going over there in general.</p>
