you word a little beforehand. To be sure, when M. Caeparius met me in Poultry Wood<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_231_1" id="target_note_LCL216_231_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and I asked after you, he told me you were in bed with the gout in your feet. I was properly sorry of course, but decided to come all the same—to see you, visit you, and even dine, for I don’t suppose your cook is a fellow sufferer. Expect a guest then—a small eater and a foe to sumptuous banquets.</p>

<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to M. Marius greetings.</p>
<p>On 21 November I arrived at my place near Cumae with your, or rather our, friend Libo. I mean to go on to Pompeii straight away, but shall send you word in advance. I always wish you to keep well, but particularly during my visit; for you see what a long time it is since we were last in one another’s company. So if you have an appointment with the gout, please put it off for another day. Take care of yourself then, and expect me in two or three days’ time.</p>
