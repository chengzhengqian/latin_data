wretched environment. The case of M. Planius Heres, also of Cales and a close friend of Lepta’s, is almost identical.</p>
<p>I recommend both these persons to you, and I could not do so with a greater measure of sincere concern and anxiety. I am interested for their own sake; friendship and humanity alike move me strongly on their behalf. But when Lepta is so profoundly concerned (his fortunes seem to be at stake), my concern must approach, or even equal, his. Therefore I should like you to persuade yourself that, often as I have experienced the warmth of your affection for me, I shall judge of it particularly in this affair.</p>
<p>Accordingly I request you, or beg you if you will allow me, to save these unhappy persons, whose calamities are due to Fortune, whom there is no evading, rather than to any fault of their own, and to make it your wish that through you, I may confer this favour not only upon the principals, friends of mine as they are, but upon the town of Cales, with which I have a close connection, and upon Lepta, who matters to me most of all.</p>
<p>What I am about to say is probably not very relevant to the matter at issue, but still it can do no harm to mention it. One of the two has very little money, the other hardly up to Knight’s qualification. Since, then, Caesar has generously granted them their lives and there is nothing much else which can be taken from them, get them permission (if you love me as much as I am sure you do) to return to Italy. There is nothing in that which need take up much time, except the journey; and this they are ready to undertake in order to live with their families and die at home. Once again I earnestly ask you to try your utmost, or rather to <span class="italic">do</span> it, for I am satisfied that you have the power.</p>
