official career. Then came L. Masso, of aedilician rank, and many Massos after him. All the foregoing were patricians, and I hope you will have their portraits in your hall.</p>
<p>Then follow the Carbos and the Turdi. These were plebeians, and I advise you to ignore them. For with the exception of the C. Carbo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_189_7" id="target_note_LCL216_189_7"><sup>7</sup></a> who was killed by Damasippus, not one of the Carbos was an asset to his country. We knew Cn. Carbo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_189_8" id="target_note_LCL216_189_8"><sup>8</sup></a> and his brother the wag—a pair of rascals if ever there was one. Of my friend who is still with us,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_189_9" id="target_note_LCL216_189_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Rubria’s son, I say nothing. There were the three famous brothers, C., Cn., and M. Carbo. Marcus, a great thief, was condemned after his career in Sicily on a charge brought by P. Flaccus. Gaius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_189_10" id="target_note_LCL216_189_10"><sup>10</sup></a> is said to have swallowed Spanish fly when prosecuted by Crassus. He was a seditious Tribune of the Plebs and was believed to have murdered P. Africanus. As for the man<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_189_11" id="target_note_LCL216_189_11"><sup>11</sup></a> who was put to death at Lilybaeum by our friend Pompey, he was in my opinion as arrant a rascal as ever breathed. His father before him was prosecuted by M. Antonius and is thought to have been acquitted by shoe-blacking.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_189_12a" id="target_note_LCL216_189_12a"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>So I recommend you to ‘revert to the <span class="italic">patres.</span>’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_189_13" id="target_note_LCL216_189_13"><sup>13</sup></a> The plebeians were an unconscionable lot, as you see.</p>
