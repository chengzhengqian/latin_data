the beginning of the Civil War to ask you what you thought I should do—join Pompey or stay in Italy. You recommended me to think of my reputation; from which I understood your opinion, and admired your scrupulous honesty as an adviser. For although you believed that your greatest friend<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_121_1" id="target_note_LCL230_121_1"><sup>1</sup></a> would have preferred it otherwise, you thought more of my duty than of his wishes.</p>
<p>For my part, I had a regard for you even before that time and have always felt that you had a regard for me. When I was away and in great danger, I remember how you cared for and protected my absent self and my family on the spot. To our familiar association since my return, and to my sentiments and public expressions about yourself, we can call everybody who notices such things to witness. But the weightiest tribute you paid to my good faith and consistency was after Caesar’s death, when you gave me your friendship without reserve. If I do not justify your choice by the most hearty good will towards you and by all friendly offices in my power, I shall consider myself a poor creature indeed.</p>
<p>On your side, my dear Oppius, you will maintain your affection (I say this more as a conventional form than because I suppose you need any reminder), and give me your support in all my concerns. I have asked Atticus to make sure you don’t lack information about them. Expect a more substantial letter from me as soon as I get a little time to spare.</p>
<p>Take care of your health—you can do me no greater favour.</p>
