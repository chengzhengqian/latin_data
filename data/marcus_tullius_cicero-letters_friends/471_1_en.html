As for the persons named, let me ask you to extend them, as you naturally would, all possible courtesy and consideration. You will attach some worthy gentlemen to your connection and your favour will bind a township which never forgets an obligation. As for myself, I shall be even more beholden than I should otherwise have been, because, while it is my constant habit to look after my fellow townsmen, I have a particular concern and responsibility towards them this year.

You will have done honour to them, and above all to me, if the corporate property of the municipality is well managed thanks to your good will and attention. May I again ask you this favour most earnestly?</p>
