The relevant facts are as follows: The king’s representative, Hammonius, is openly working against us with money. His intermediaries are the creditors who played the same role when you were in Rome.

But in January the custodians of the Sibylline prophecies produced an oracle forbidding the employment of a host. This was no doubt also a move against Pompey, who came more and more to be suspected of wanting to handle the restoration himself. The business dragged on for a while, but in the end Lentulus did nothing, and Ptolemy was reinstated by the enterprising governor of Syria, A.
