<span class="salute">CICERO TO CORNIFICIUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, ca. 21 December 44</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Cornificius greetings.</p>
<p>On 20 December a well attended meeting of the Senate accepted my proposals on certain urgent and important matters, including one to the effect that provincial governors should remain at their posts and hand over authority only to successors appointed by senatorial decree. I made this motion in the public interest, but I assure you that I was also actuated in no small measure by concern for the preservation of your personal consequence. Accordingly, I would ask you for the sake of our affection and exhort you for the sake of the commonwealth to allow no person any jurisdiction in your province and always to make your own public standing your primary considerationâ€”and no man could stand higher. I will be candid, as our friendship requires. In the matter of Sempronius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_183_1" id="target_note_LCL230_183_1"><sup>1</sup></a> you would have gained a great deal of credit in all quarters if you had paid heed to my letter. But that is a thing of the past and of no great moment: this is really important: be sure to keep your province in the control of the commonwealth.</p>
<p>I should have written more if your people had not been in a hurry. So please make my excuses to our friend Chaerippus.</p>
