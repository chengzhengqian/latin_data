and pleasure. Furthermore (you will not mind my being candid), I am afraid you will unlearn what little you used to know, and forget how to give little dinner parties. For if you made such small progress in the art when you had models to imitate, what am I to expect of you now? When I laid the facts before Spurinna and explained to him your former mode of life, he pronounced a grave danger to the supreme interests of the commonwealth unless you resume your old habits when Favonius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_197_3" id="target_note_LCL230_197_3"><sup>3</sup></a> starts to blow; at the present time of year he said he thought it might be borne, if you could not bear the cold.</p>
