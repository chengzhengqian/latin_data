advancement which you have hitherto attained—and most splendid they are—will count but as so many official titles, not as symbols of public esteem, unless you ally yourself with the freedom of the Roman People and the authority of the Senate. At long last pray dissociate yourself from those to whom no choice of yours but bonds forged by circumstances have attached you. In this period of political turmoil a number of persons have been called Consuls, none of whom has been considered a Consular unless he displayed a patriotism worthy of the office. Such a patriot you should show yourself: firstly, in dissociating yourself from all connection with disloyal citizens, persons utterly unlike you; secondly, in offering yourself to the Senate and all honest men as adviser, principal, leader; lastly, in judging peace to consist, not in the mere laying down of weapons, but in the banishment of the fear of weapons and servitude. If such are your acts and sentiments, you will be not only a Consul and a Consular, but a great Consul and Consular. If otherwise, there will be no honour in these splendid official designations; rather they will carry the direst disgrace.</p>
<p>Prompted by good will, I have written rather gravely. You will prove the truth of my words by experience, in that path of conduct which is worthy of you.</p>
<p>Dispatched 20 March.</p>
