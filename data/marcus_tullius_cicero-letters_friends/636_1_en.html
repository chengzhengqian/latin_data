out the remnants of the war, I think that no course could be better or redound more to your credit and honour; and I consider that your activity, energy, and patriotic spirit should be of more account than a swift attainment of the Praetorship. For I would not have you unaware how much credit you have already won. Believe me, it is second only to Plancus’, and that by Plancus’ own testimony as well as by report and universal opinion. So if you have any further work to do, I consider it most important that you should go ahead with it. Surely that is the most honourable course, and surely honour must come first. On the other hand, if you think you have done enough for duty and enough for your country, I advise you to lose no time in returning for the elections, since they will be held early; always provided that such haste in the furtherance of your career does not in any degree detract from the reputation we<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_313_1" id="target_note_LCL230_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> have won. Many famous men, while engaged on public service, have not stood for office in the normal year.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_313_2" id="target_note_LCL230_313_2"><sup>2</sup></a> That course is all the easier for us because this is not your appointed year in the way that, had you been Aedile, your time would have come two years later. As things stand, you will be looked upon as not letting slip any of the customary, quasi-legal period of candidacy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_313_3a" id="target_note_LCL230_313_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> It also occurs to me that your candidacy will have more éclat when Plancus is Consul (though you would have nothing to worry about even without him), if only matters in Gaul have been brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
