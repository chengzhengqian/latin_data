<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Tusculum, July (?) 46</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Tullius to his dear Tiro greetings.</p>
<p>From your letter I trust that you are better, certainly I very much hope so. Mind you consider that in every way, and don’t take it into your head that you are acting against my wishes in not being with me. You <span class="italic">are</span> with me if you are looking after yourself. So I want you to care for your health rather than for my eyes and ears. Of course I enjoy hearing and seeing you, but that will be a much greater pleasure if you are fit and well.</p>
<p>I am idling here because I don’t write anything myself, though I am reading with great gusto. If the copyists up there can’t make out my handwriting, you will put them right. There <span class="italic">is</span> a rather difficult inset which I don’t find easy to read myself, the story about Cato as a four-year-old.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_177_1" id="target_note_LCL216_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a> See about the dining room, as you are doing. Tertia will be there, provided that Publilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_177_2a" id="target_note_LCL216_177_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> is not invited.</p>
<p>That fellow Demetrius was never a Phalereus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_177_3" id="target_note_LCL216_177_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but now he is an absolute Bellienus!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_177_4" id="target_note_LCL216_177_4"><sup>4</sup></a> So I appoint you my deputy—you show him the courtesies. ‘Though to be sure…,’ ‘All the same …,’ ‘As to that …’—you know how it goes on. Still, if you have any talk with him, please write and tell me,
