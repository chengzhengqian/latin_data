None the less, as soon as he was able to walk, he was ready to be foremost in every dangerous work, regarding his recovery as for the commonwealth’s benefit as much as his own. However, I have urged, in fact compelled, him to leave for Rome, on the ground that in his present state of health he would be more likely to wear himself out than to help me in camp; and I thought that a man of his calibre would be needed as Praetor in city affairs, now that the state has been left denuded by the lamentable loss of the Consuls. If anyone at home disapproves of this, let him know that there has been a failure of judgement on my part, not any lack of patriotic loyalty on my brother’s.</p>
<p>To resume, Lepidus has complied with my desire that he should send me Apella<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_301_1" id="target_note_LCL230_301_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as a hostage for his good faith and collaboration in the public service. In this connection, I have found L. Gellius, one of the three brothers from Segovia (?),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_301_2" id="target_note_LCL230_301_2"><sup>2</sup></a> very ready to help. He has been my latest go-between with Lepidus. I think I can say that he has proved himself a good patriot and I am glad to testify accordingly, as I shall readily do for all who deserve it.</p>
<p>Take care of your health and remember me kindly, as I do you. Stand up for me in public (if I deserve it), as you have done hitherto with such notable good will.</p>
