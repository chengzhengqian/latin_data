<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Plancus.</p>
<p>Although sufficiently apprised of your political sentiments and intentions by our friend Furnius, I have reached a clearer assessment of your whole attitude after reading your letter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_239_1" id="target_note_LCL230_239_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The Fortune of the commonwealth is deciding all points at issue in a single battle (when you read these lines I expect its outcome will have been determined). None the less the widespread report of your sentiments has in itself redounded greatly to your credit. Had we had a Consul in Rome, the Senate would have declared its appreciation of your efforts and preparations and conferred high honours upon yourself. But the time for that has not gone by; indeed, in my judgement it was not yet ripe. For I always consider an honour to be really and truly such when offered and given, not in the expectation of future benefit, but to persons whose great services have made them illustrious.</p>
<p>And so, provided always that some form of free society exists wherein honours can shine, all the highest, trust me, shall be yours in abundance. But an honour truly so called is not an allurement offered at a crisis, but the reward of constant merit. Therefore, my dear Plancus, strive heart and soul for glory, bring aid to your country, succour to your colleague, support to the marvellous union of all nations banded together in spirit. In me you will find one to help your counsels and further your advancement, an ever loyal and loving friend in all things. For to the bonds
