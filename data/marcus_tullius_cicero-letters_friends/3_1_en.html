will in response to the ungrudging warmth of my tributes to yourself.</p>
<p>When in the course of my remarks I explained how eagerly I had been looking forward to your speech and how egregiously I had been astray, my speech caused some amusement and a moderate amount of laughter ensued—not directed at you, but rather at my mistake, and at the artless candour with which I admitted my desire to be praised by you. Really there could be nothing but compliment to you in my saying that at the very height of my glory I still hankered for some testimonial from <span class="italic">your</span> lips.</p>
<p>As for your reference to ‘our reciprocal sentiments,’ I do not know how you define reciprocity in friendship. I conceive it to lie in good will equally received and returned.

Be pleased to recall what followed, how promptly I called the Senate together on the day the lottery had taken place, and at what length I spoke about you. You said to me yourself that my speech was flattering to you to the point of being less than complimen­tary

Cicero enlisted support against Catiline from his unreliable colleague C. Antonius by letting him have Macedonia instead of drawing lots. Later he an- nounced that he would not take a province at all, leaving Cisalpine Gaul to be allotted to one of the eight Praetors. He goes on to imply that Antonius, instigated by himself, had manipulated the lottery in Celer’s favour.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL205_41_3a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
