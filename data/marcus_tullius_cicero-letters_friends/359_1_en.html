So I expressed gratitude to Caesar at considerable length,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_249_3" id="target_note_LCL216_249_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and I am afraid I may have thus forfeited in other contexts the decent retirement which was my only consolation in adversity. However, now that I have escaped his displeasure (he might have thought I did not regard the present regime as constitutional if I never broke silence), I shall do this in moderation, or rather on the near side of moderation, so as to meet his wishes on the one hand and the claims of my literary pursuits on the other. From my childhood I have taken pleasure in every liberal art and branch of knowledge, most of all in philosophy; but my devotion to this study grows upon me every day. I suppose I have reached an age ripe for wisdom; and the evils of the times are such that nothing else can relieve one’s mind of its burdens. I see from your letter that business is distracting you from this pursuit, but the lengthening nights will soon be some help.</p>
<p>Your boy, Servius, our boy rather, is most attentive to me. His sterling worth and high character, and more particularly his devotion to literary studies, are my delight. He often confers with me about the question of your staying on or coming home. So far I take the view that we should do nothing but what appears most in accord with Caesar’s wishes. The state of affairs is such that, if you were in Rome, nothing could give you pleasure except your family and friends. That aside, the best feature in the scene is himself. Other persons and things are such as one would prefer to learn of by report than see, if it were necessary to do one or the other. This advice of mine is by no means agreeable to <span class="italic">me</span>—I am anxious to see you, but counsel for your good.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
