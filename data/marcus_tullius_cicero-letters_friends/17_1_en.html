success, while I refused to follow those who sought my friendship. If only I had relied upon my own judgement instead of paying so much attention to the talk of friends, whether fools or knaves, how happy I might have been! As things are, since our friends tell us to hope, I shall take care not to let my health let your efforts down. I well understand the magnitude of the task, and how much easier it would have been to stay at home than it is to return. However, if we have all the Tribunes on our side, if Lentulus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_69_1" id="target_note_LCL205_69_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is as zealous as he seems, and if we also have Pompey’s and Caesar’s good will, we ought not to despair.</p>
<p>As to my household, I shall do as you tell me our friends think best. As to my place of residence, the epidemic has now disappeared, but while it lasted it did not touch me. Plancius, who is untiring in his good offices, is anxious to have me with him, and keeps me here. I wanted to stay in some less frequented place in Epirus out of the way of Piso<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_69_2" id="target_note_LCL205_69_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and his soldiers, but Plancius still keeps me here. He hopes it may turn out that he leaves for Italy in my company. If I live to see that day, and return to my family’s embraces, and get all of you and my own self back again, I shall feel that your devotion to me and mine to you have been sufficiently rewarded.</p>
<p>Piso’s kindness, manliness, and affection for us all is quite superlative. I pray it may bring him happiness; certainly it will bring him honour. As regards my brother Quintus, I meant no criticism of yourself; but I wanted you all to be as close to one another as possible, especially as you are so few. I have thanked the persons you wished me to thank, and written that my information came from you.</p>
<p>Dearest, you tell me that you are going to sell a row of houses. This is dreadful. What in the name of heaven, <span class="italic">what</span>
