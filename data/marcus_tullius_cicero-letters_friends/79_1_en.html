<span class="salute">CICERO TO TREBATIUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, (late August?) 54</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Trebatius.</p>
<p>Caesar has written to me very civilly, regretting that he has so far been too busy to get to know you very well, but assuring me that this will come. I told him in my reply how greatly he would oblige me by conferring upon you all he could in the way of good will, friendly offices, and liberality. But your letter gave me an impression of undue impatience; also it surprised me that you make so little account of the advantages of a Tribunate, especially one involving no military service. I shall complain to Vacerra and Manilius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_193_1" id="target_note_LCL205_193_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I dare not say a word to Cornelius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_193_2" id="target_note_LCL205_193_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He is responsible if you play the fool, since you give out that it was from him you learned your <span class="italic">wisdom.</span> Now why don’t you press this opportunity, this chance? You’ll never find a better.</p>
<p>As for what you say about that Counsellor Precianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_193_3" id="target_note_LCL205_193_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I go on commending you to him, for he writes himself that he has given you reason to be grateful. Let me know how that matter stands. I am looking forward to Britannic letters from you all.</p>
