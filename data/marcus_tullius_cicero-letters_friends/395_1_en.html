<p>You know that in my earlier letters I have sought to console you as a brave, sensible man rather than hold out any assurance of restoration, apart from what I thought should be hoped for from the commonwealth itself, once this conflagration has been extinguished. Remember your own letters, in which you have always shown me a lofty spirit, steadfast and ready for whatever might betide. That gave me no surprise, recalling as I did that you have been engaged in public affairs from your youth upwards, that your periods of office have coincided with the very crises of our national fortunes and existence,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_321_2" id="target_note_LCL216_321_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and that you embarked on this very war prepared for the role not only of happy winner but, should it so fall out, of philosophic loser. Since, furthermore, you devote your literary activity to recording the deeds of brave men for posterity, it behoves you to consider it your duty not to present yourself as in any way dissimilar to the objects of your eulogies.</p>
<p>Such words, however, would be more appropriate to a state of things which you have already left behind you. As matters now stand, you have only to prepare yourself to bear conditions here along with us. If I knew any remedy for them, I should pass it on to you. But the one refuge is learning and literary work, which we have always pursued. Merely a source of pleasure in good times, it now appears as our lifeline.</p>
<p>But to return to my starting point: have no doubt that all is settled for your restoration and return.</p>
