Rome all this time we have been separated. Take what you say you have in view (nobody can do it better than you, and I am eagerly looking forward to the prospect)—speeches in the Senate and general activity and conduct of public affairs, as to which I shall tell you my opinion and position presently and answer your enquiries—well, at least I should have found in you the wisest and most affectionate of guides, while you would have found in me an adviser of experience perhaps not altogether negligible, and of undeniable loyalty and good will. For your sake, it is true, I am duly delighted to think of you as Imperator, governing your province after a successful campaign at the head of a victorious army. But at least you could have enjoyed the due fruits of my gratitude fuller and fresher on the spot; and when it came to repaying certain people, some of them hostile to you, as you know, because you championed my restoration, others jealous of the grandeur and glory of the achievement—what a companion in arms I should have made you! To be sure, that inveterate enemy of his friends<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_119_1" id="target_note_LCL205_119_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who recompensed your signal favours by turning the feeble remnants of his violence against you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_119_2" id="target_note_LCL205_119_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has done our work for us. The exposure of his recent operations<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_119_3" id="target_note_LCL205_119_3"><sup>3</sup></a> has robbed him of all independence in the future, let alone prestige. I could have wished that you had gained your experience in my case and not in your own as well, but I am glad in a bad business to think that you have not paid so very heavy a price for a lesson in the unreliability of mankind which <span class="italic">I</span> learned to my bitter sorrow.</p>
