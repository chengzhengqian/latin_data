<p>You say you are confident that with my prestige and eloquence something can be achieved. Well, something <span class="italic">has</span> been achieved, if we allow for the deplorable state of affairs. The People of Rome realizes that there are three Consulars who cannot come to the Senate in safety because they felt as loyal citizens and spoke their minds. Beyond that you must expect nothing. Your relative<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_143_4" id="target_note_LCL230_143_4"><sup>4</sup></a> is delighted with his new connection, and so he is no longer interested in the Games, and is ready to burst at the endless applause they give your brother. Your other connection<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_143_5" id="target_note_LCL230_143_5"><sup>5</sup></a> likewise has been cajoled by new memoranda of Caesar’s.

As for my good friend L. Cotta, to use his own phrase, he is in a state of fatalistic despair, and rarely comes to the Senate any more. L. Caesar, an excellent citizen and a brave man, is tied by ill health. Ser. Sulpicius has great prestige and loyal sentiments, but he is away. As for the rest,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_143_7" id="target_note_LCL230_143_7"><sup>7</sup></a> the Designates<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_143_8" id="target_note_LCL230_143_8"><sup>8</sup></a> excepted, you’ll forgive me<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_143_9" id="target_note_LCL230_143_9"><sup>9</sup></a> but I don’t reckon them as
