have loads to be carried, we must pause. Should they be such as you can cope with, then make haste—it will be the brightest feather in your cap. But if they are too heavy, you must consider. It would be a pity to arrive just at the least favourable moment. The matter is entirely for you to judge. You know your own strength. If you <span class="italic">can,</span> there is credit and popular approval to be had. But if you really cannot, you will find the talk less annoying elsewhere.</p>
<p>As for me, my plea in this letter is the same as in my last. Strain every nerve to prevent any prolongation of my present office, which both Senate and People fixed for one year. I press you on this point feeling that my worldly welfare depends on it. You can look to our friend Paullus, a thorough well-wisher of mine. There is Curio, there is Furnius. Do try your hardest, in the persuasion that it means everything to me.</p>
<p>The last of the points I mentioned was the strengthening of our friendship. On that little need be said. As a boy you drew towards me, and on my side I always believed that I should be proud of you. You also defended me in my darkest days. After you went abroad, I formed a very close friendship with your connection<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_461_4" id="target_note_LCL205_461_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Brutus. In your joint talents and energy I think I have a rich prospect of pleasure and prestige; and I earnestly ask you to confirm that opinion by your zeal. Send me a letter at once, and when you are back in Rome write as often as you can.</p>
