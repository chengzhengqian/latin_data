Senate from passing a decree. ‘And supposing,’ said another questioner, ‘he chooses to be Consul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_385_15" id="target_note_LCL205_385_15"><sup>15</sup></a> <span class="italic">and</span> keep his army?’ To which Pompey, as gently as you please: ‘And supposing my son chooses to take his stick to me?’ These utterances of his have produced an impression that Pompey is having trouble with Caesar. So it looks to me as though Caesar is now ready to settle for one of two propositions—either to stay where he is and forgo his candidature this year,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_385_16" id="target_note_LCL205_385_16"><sup>16</sup></a> or, if he can secure election, to retire from his command. Curio is making ready for all-out opposition to him. What he may be able to accomplish I don’t know, but it is clear to me that he cannot come to grief even if he achieves nothing, his sentiments being sound.</p>
<p>Curio is behaving handsomely to me, and has made me a somewhat onerous present in the shape of the African panthers which were imported for his show. Had he not done that, one might have let the thing go. As it is, I have to give it. So, as I have asked you all along, please see that I have a few beasts from your part of the world. And I commend Sittius’ bond to your kind attention. I have sent out my freedman Philo and a Greek, Diogenes, and given them a message and a letter for you. Please look after them and the object of their errand. How important that is to me I have explained in the letter which they will deliver to you.</p>
