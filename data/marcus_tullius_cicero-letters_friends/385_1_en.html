to the course you so well and gallantly undertook, the same that Fortune herself decreed as the final limit to our struggles.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_301_2" id="target_note_LCL216_301_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Therefore I implore and conjure you in the name of our old association and friendship, and of the abundant good will I bear you and you equally bear me; preserve yourself for me, for your mother,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_301_3" id="target_note_LCL216_301_3"><sup>3</sup></a> your wife, and all your family, to whom you are and have ever been most dear.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_301_4" id="target_note_LCL216_301_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Think of your own safety and that of those near to you, who depend on you. Make use now of what you have learned, those admirable teachings handed down by the wisest of mankind which from youth up you have absorbed into your memory and knowledge. Bear the loss of persons bound to you by good will and good offices,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_301_5" id="target_note_LCL216_301_5"><sup>5</sup></a> signal in measure and number, if not with equanimity, then at any rate with fortitude.</p>
<p>What <span class="italic">I</span> can do I do not know, or rather I am conscious that it is all too little. But I promise you to do whatever in my judgement conduces to your safety and dignity with the same devotion that <span class="italic">you</span> have always shown to practical effect in <span class="italic">my</span> affairs. This disposition of mine I have freely conveyed to that excellent lady your mother, who bears you so deep an affection. If you write to me, I shall execute your wishes as I understand them. But if you do not write, I shall none the less pay most zealous and particular heed to everything that seems to me for your advantage.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
