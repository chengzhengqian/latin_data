<p>In civil war, never once experienced by our forbears but often by our own generation, all things are sad, but none sadder than victory itself. Even if it goes to the better party, it makes them more fierce and violent; though they may not be so by nature, they are forced to it willy-nilly. For the victor has often to act even against his inclination at the behest of those to whom he owes his victory. Did you not see as I did how cruel that other victory would have proved?

You ought rather to pity her, and not deprive her of the sight of you also, bereft as she is of many illustrious children.</p>
