<p>If such talk about me has been carried to you by others, you should not have believed them. If, on the other hand, you favour the practice of attributing to others the thoughts that enter your own mind, you introduce into friendship a far from gentlemanly mode of conversation. Had I ever had it in mind to derogate from your good name in the province, I should not ∗ ∗ ∗ your son-in-law, nor should I have consulted your freedman at Brundisium or your Prefect of Engineers at Corcyra as to where you wished me to go. So, following the advice of learned men who have written excellent books on the conduct of friendship, you can dismiss this whole line of language—‘they contended . . . <span class="italic">I</span> argued to the contrary,’ ‘they said . . . <span class="italic">I</span> denied it.’</p>
<p>Perhaps you suppose that nothing has ever been said to <span class="italic">me</span> about <span class="italic">you?</span> For example, that after desiring me to go to Laodicea you yourself crossed the Taurus?

One thing I <span class="italic">will</span> say as I think: if the sayings you attribute to others are your own sentiments, you are very much to blame; but if others do talk to you in this strain, you are still in some degree to blame for listening. My attitude throughout our friendship will be found consistent and responsible. If I am credited with cunning, may I point out that I always upheld your interests in your absence, even though I had no thought
