<p>One way or another I should have met you if you had chosen to go to the place arranged. Regardful of my convenience, you did not want to put me about; but I should like you to believe that, if you had sent me word, I should have set your wish above my convenience.</p>

Now that the lex Julia makes it necessary to leave accounts in the province and present an identical copy to the Treasury, I did in the province what I should have done at Rome if the previous practice had still held good.
