but that Pleasure and Peace of Mind are won by virtue, justice, and Good is both true and easily argued. Epicurus himself, from whom all these sorry translators of terms, Catius, Amafinius, etc., derive, says: ‘To live pleasurably is not possible without living rightly and justly.’ Thus it is that Pansa, whose goal is Pleasure, retains Virtue; and those whom you and your friends call Pleasure-lovers are Good-lovers and Justice-lovers, practising and retaining all the virtues. And so Sulla<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_287_2" id="target_note_LCL216_287_2"><sup>2</sup></a> (whose judgement<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_287_3" id="target_note_LCL216_287_3"><sup>3</sup></a> we must respect) saw that the philosophers were at loggerheads: instead of trying to discover <span class="italic">what</span> was good, he went and bought up all the goods he could find! Indeed I have borne his death with fortitude. However, Caesar will not let us miss him long—he has other victims of justice to offer us in his place. Nor will <span class="italic">he</span> miss Sulla’s activity in the auction rooms—he will only have to look at Sulla junior.</p>
<p>Now to get back to public affairs, let me know in your reply how things are going in Spain. I’m devilish worried, and I’d rather have the old easygoing master than try a cruel new one. You know what a fool Gnaeus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_287_4" id="target_note_LCL216_287_4"><sup>4</sup></a> is, how he takes cruelty for courage, how he thinks we always made fun of him. I’m afraid he may answer our persiflage with his sword, hobbledehoy fashion. If you love me, tell me what is going on. Ah, how I should like to know your frame of mind as you read this! Anxious or easy? I should know by the same token what I ought to do.</p>
<p>Not to be too prolix, good-bye. Go on caring for me. If Caesar has won, expect me quickly back.</p>
