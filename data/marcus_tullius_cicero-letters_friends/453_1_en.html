<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to M. Fabius Gallus greetings.</p>
<p>Everywhere I turn I come across traces of your affection, as most recently in the affair of Tigellius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_437_1a" id="target_note_LCL216_437_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> I could see from your letter that you have been very much concerned. So I thank you for the kind intention. But on the matter itself, one or two observations. Cipius I think it was who said on a certain occasion ‘I am not asleep to everybody.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_437_2aa" id="target_note_LCL216_437_2aa"><sup>2</sup></a> Just so, my dear Gallus, I am not a slave to everybody. Though I don’t know why I talk of slavery. In the old days, when I was supposed to be a monarch,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_437_3" id="target_note_LCL216_437_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I was never so courted as I now am by Caesar’s closest intimates, all except your friend. I consider myself so much the gainer, not to have to put up with the fellow—more pestilential than his native cli­mate!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_439_4" id="target_note_LCL216_439_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
