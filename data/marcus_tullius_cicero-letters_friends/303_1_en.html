<p>I have at last received a letter from Caesar, quite a handsome one. He is said to be arriving in person sooner than was expected. I shall let you know when I have decided whether to go to meet him or to wait for him here. Please send the couriers back to me as soon as possible. Take good care of your health.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>Dispatched 12 August.</p>
