<p class="noindent">From Tullius to his dear Terentia greetings.</p>
<p>I hope your joy at our safe arrival in Italy may be a lasting one. But distracted as I was by my unhappiness and the cruel ill treatment of my family, I am afraid I may have taken a road with no easy outcome. So help me as far as you can—though what you can do I cannot imagine. There is no reason for you to leave home at present. It is a long, unsafe journey, and I do not see what good you can do if you come.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>Dispatched 4 November from Brundisium.</p>
