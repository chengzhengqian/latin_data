ominous bird or the left-hand cry of another, as our system prescribes, nor yet from <span class="italic">tripudia solistima</span> or <span class="italic">sonivia.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_351_7" id="target_note_LCL216_351_7"><sup>7</sup></a> I have other signs to watch—no surer, perhaps, but less difficult to perceive and less readily mistaken. For the purpose of my divining the signs are observed in two categories, one deriving from Caesar’s personality, the other from the general nature of political conditions.</p>
<p>In Caesar we find a mild and merciful disposition, as portrayed in your excellent volume of <span class="italic">Remonstrances.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_351_8a" id="target_note_LCL216_351_8a"><sup>8</sup></a> Moreover, he is remarkably partial to outstanding talents like your own. He also defers to a widespread sentiment, when it is just and inspired by principle, not frivolous or self-interested; and in that connection he will be powerfully impressed by the united voice of Etruria. Why then have these factors hitherto failed of their due effect? Because he reckons he will be unable to resist a multitude of claims if once he gives way to you, with whom he is supposed to have more right to be angry. You will ask what in that case we have to hope for from an angry arbiter. This: he will realize that he is going to draw his praises from the fountain that sprinkled him with cold water. Finally, he is a very clever, farsighted man. He realizes that a man like you, of birth easily the highest in your part of Italy, which is a very far from contemptible part, and in our common body politic equal to any of the best of your generation in talent, influence, and public reputation, cannot be barred from the commonwealth in the long run. He will not wish you to owe your eventual restoration to time rather than to himself straight away.</p>
