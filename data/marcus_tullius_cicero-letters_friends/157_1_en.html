<p class="noindent">From Caelius to Cicero greetings.</p>
<p>Yes, I tell you, it’s true. He<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_349_1a" id="target_note_LCL205_349_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> has been acquitted (I was there when the verdict was announced), and that by all three categories—but by one vote in each.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_349_2" id="target_note_LCL205_349_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Just be thankful, say you.
