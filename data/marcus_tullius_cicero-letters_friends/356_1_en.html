they tell you, from a true friend, of considerations which may serve to lighten your troubles. All other sources of comfort lie in yourself. I know them, and they are not small; or rather to my way of thinking, they are by far the greatest of all. I experience them every day and value them so highly as to see my salvation in them. I well remember how keen a student <span class="italic">you</span> have been from childhood in every branch of letters, how eagerly and attentively you learned all that the wisest of mankind have handed down to show us how to live. These studies could be useful and delightful in the height of prosperity; but in times like these we have nothing else to ease our hearts. I will not presume. I will not urge a man of your attainments and disposition to have recourse to the pursuits to which you have given your energies from your earliest years. I shall only say something I think you will approve: seeing that there is no further place in Senate House or Forum for the craft which I have studied, I have devoted all my time and attention to philosophy. Little more scope is left for your branch of knowledge,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_243_2" id="target_note_LCL216_243_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in which you have attained such outstanding distinction, than for mine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_243_3" id="target_note_LCL216_243_3"><sup>3</sup></a> So, not to offer you counsel, I feel sure that you are engaged in the same pursuits as myself. Even if they do little good, they distract the mind from its anxiety.</p>
<p>Your son Servius engages and excels in all the pursuits of a gentleman, especially in the one in which I have told you my heart finds ease. In my regard for him I yield to you and to nobody else; and he requites me. He thinks, as is plain to see, that in paying attention and respect to me he is doing what best pleases you.</p>
