<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, 47 or 46</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to Allienus, Proconsul, greetings.</p>
<p>I think you know how high a regard I had for C. Avianius Flaccus, and I heard from his own lips (he was an excellent man, most appreciative of a kindness) how handsomely you treated him. His sons are thoroughly worthy of their father, and very dear friends of mine. May I recommend them to you as warmly as I possibly can? C. Avianius is in Sicily, Marcus is here with us. I beg you to enhance the standing of the former, who is on the spot, and to protect the interests of both. You can do nothing in your present province to oblige me more, and I do most particularly request it of you.</p>

277 (XIII.10)
<span class="salute">CICERO TO M. BRUTUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, beginning of 46 (?</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Brutus greetings.</p>
<p>When your Quaestor, M. Varro,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_467_1" id="target_note_LCL216_467_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was setting off to join you I did not think he needed any recommendation. Traditional usage, I thought, was in itself sufficient to recommend him to youâ€”which, as you are aware, has decreed that this relationship of Quaestor to superior should stand next to that of children to parents. But Varro himself is persuaded that a carefully drafted letter of mine concerning him will carry great weight with you, and urges me to write as fully as possible. So I have thought it better to comply
