<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to Q. Gallius.</p>
<p>I hope your affection for me, which to be sure has long been apparent, will be shown in many contexts, but here you have a matter in which you can easily demonstrate your good will towards me. A friend of mine, L. Oppius, son of Marcus, is in business at Philomelium. I recommend him to you very specially, all the more so because, besides the regard I have for himself, he is managing the affairs of L. Egnatius Rufus. Now Egnatius is of all Roman Knights on the most familiar terms with me; daily intercourse and many important services rendered have created a close attachment.</p>
<p>So I am asking you to look kindly on Oppius, who is on the spot, and to protect Egnatius’ interests in his absence just as though his affairs were mine. I should be grateful if, to aid your memory, you would write a few lines to be delivered to you in the province—but write in such terms that, when you read them, you can readily recall the urgency of this recommendation of mine. This I beg of you as a special favour.</p>
