night as I was leaving for Ariminum<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_119_1" id="target_note_LCL216_119_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and you gave me a peace message for Caesar, and played your fine patriotic role—you neglected the duty of a friend, you did not think of me! I don’t say all this because I doubt our party’s success. But, believe me, death is better than the spectacle of these people.</p>
<p>But for the fear of your party’s ferocity we should have been thrown out of here long ago, for apart from a few capitalists there’s not a man or a class here that is not for Pompey. Thanks to me, the lower classes especially, and the general public, which used to be on our side, are now on yours.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_119_2" id="target_note_LCL216_119_2"><sup>2</sup></a> You ask why. No, you and your friends must wait and see. I’ll make you win in spite of yourselves. Cato and company will be smiling on me yet! You folk are fast asleep. You don’t seem to me to understand conditions over here as yet—where we are vulnerable, how weak we are. And I shall not be doing this in the hope of any reward, but from what is apt to be the most powerful motive with me—indignation and outrage.</p>
<p>What are you and your friends doing over there? Waiting for a battle? There lies Caesar’s <span class="italic">forte.</span> I don’t know about your army, but our fellows are desperate fighters and accustomed to take cold and hunger in their day’s work.</p>
