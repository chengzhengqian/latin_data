<span class="salute">CICERO TO LENTULUS SPINTHER</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, February (?) 55</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to P. Lentulus, Proconsul, greetings.</p>
<p>On all matters that concern you—proceedings, decisions, Pompey’s undertaking<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_113_1" id="target_note_LCL205_113_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—you will have an excellent informant in M. Plaetorius, who has taken, not only part, but the leading part in them. He has performed on your behalf every friendly service that affection, sagacity, and industry could render. You will likewise learn from him the whole state of public affairs, which are not easy to explain in writing. They are at all events in our friends’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_113_2" id="target_note_LCL205_113_2"><sup>2</sup></a> control, so firmly that no change in the position seems likely for a generation to come.</p>
<p>For my part I follow my prescribed course, the course which you advised and which gratitude and expediency dictate; that is to say, I attach myself to the interests of the personage<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_113_3" id="target_note_LCL205_113_3"><sup>3</sup></a> whom you thought proper to attach to yourself where my interests were concerned. But you realize how hard it is to put aside one’s political views, especially when they are well and firmly founded. However, as I cannot honourably oppose him, I adapt myself to his wishes. Nor in so doing am I belying my real feelings, as some may perhaps imagine. My inclination, indeed my affection for Pompey is strong enough to make me now feel that whatever is to his advantage and whatever he wants is right and proper. Even his opponents would in my opinion make no mistake if they gave up fighting, since they cannot be a match for him.</p>
