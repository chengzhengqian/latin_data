<p class="noindent">From Tullius to Tiro greetings.</p>
<p>I see your game! You want your letters too put into rolls. But just a moment, you yardstick of my literary style, where did you come by so bizarre a phrase as ‘faithfully<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_179_1" id="target_note_LCL216_179_1"><sup>1</sup></a> studying my health’? What is ‘faithfully’ doing in such a context? The home territory of the word is the performance of a duty, but it makes many excursions into other fields. For example, it can be applied to acquired knowledge or a house or a vocation or a piece of land within the bounds of decent metaphor as approved by Theophrastus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_179_2" id="target_note_LCL216_179_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But of this when we are together.</p>
<p>I have had a visit from Demetrius, from whose company on the road I disengaged myself rather neatly. Of course you could not have seen him. He will be in Rome tomorrow, so see him you will. For my part, I intend leaving here early the day after.</p>
<p>Your health makes me very anxious, but pamper it and leave nothing undone. <span class="italic">Then</span> you may feel that you are with me and that I am more than satisfied.</p>
