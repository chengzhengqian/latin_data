<span class="salute">PLANCUS TO CICERO</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Gallia Narbonensis, ca. 27 April 43</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Plancus to Cicero greetings.</p>
<p>I am happy to feel that the pledges I made to you were not hasty, and that those you gave to others concerning me have not proved idle. At any rate, the earlier I wished you to know my plans before anyone else the greater evidence you have of my affection.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_253_1" id="target_note_LCL230_253_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I hope you observe how the tale of my services lengthens every day; that you will learn of them in the future I do not hope so much as guarantee.</p>
<p>As for myself, my dear Cicero (so may the commonwealth be relieved with my assistance from impending evils), I prize the honours and rewards which you and those with you have to bestow as gifts surely no less precious than immortality itself; at the same time my zeal and perseverance will be no whit relaxed without them. Only if amid the throng of good patriots <span class="italic">my</span> enthusiasm and exertions shine conspicuous do I wish my standing to be enhanced by your collective support. For myself I covet nothing—that<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_253_2" id="target_note_LCL230_253_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is exactly what I am fighting against. When and what are questions which I am well content to leave to your discretion. No gift that a man receives from his country can appear tardy or trivial.</p>
<p>By dint of forced marches I have taken my army across the Rhone this 26th of April, and have sent a thousand horse ahead to Vienne by a shorter route. I myself shall not fail in the matter of speed, if I am not held up by Lepidus; but if he blocks my way, I shall act as circumstances suggest. The forces I am bringing are very strong in numbers, character, and loyalty. I ask you to remember me affection­ately,
