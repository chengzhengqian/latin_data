<span class="salute">CICERO TO D. BRUTUS</span>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, 20 December 44</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to D. Brutus, Imperator, Consul-Elect, greetings.</p>
<p>The Tribunes summoned a meeting of the Senate by proclamation for 20 December with the intention of bringing the question of a bodyguard for the Consuls-Elect before the House. I had determined not to come to the Senate before the Kalends of January, but seeing that your proclamation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_181_1" id="target_note_LCL230_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was published on that very day, I felt I should never forgive myself if the meeting passed without any reference to your immortal services to the commonwealth (which would have happened if I had not attended), or even if you did come in for honorific mention and I were not there.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I arrived at the House early. When my presence was noticed, members gathered in large numbers. Of my part in the Senateâ€™s proceedings concerning you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_181_2" id="target_note_LCL230_181_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and my subsequent speech<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_181_3" id="target_note_LCL230_181_3"><sup>3</sup></a> before a large public meeting I prefer you to learn from other correspondents. But I hope you will believe that I shall always take up and maintain with the utmost enthusiasm whatever may tend to the advancement of your public standing, which is already of the highest. I know that I shall have many fellow labourers in this field, but I shall strive for the foremost place among them.</p>
