The hope we entertain in all such cases is reinforced by that which applies peculiarly to yourself: not only on account of your standing and wealth, distinctions you possess in common with others, but what is additional and special to yourself, your outstanding talents and qualities, attributes of much importance, I do assure you, in the eyes of the personage in whose power we lie. You would not have been a moment in your present predicament if he had not thought himself injured by the very gift<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_371_2" id="target_note_LCL216_371_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of yours that pleases him.

I owe it to our longstanding affection, and my habits of behaviour to my friends, and your many services to me.</p>
