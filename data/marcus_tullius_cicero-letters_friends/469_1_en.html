with my friend’s wish, since he attaches so much importance to it.</p>
<p>To show you then that in so doing I am fulfilling an obligation, let me mention that when M. Terentius first entered public life he sought my friendship. Then, when he had established himself in the world, two additional circumstances served to increase my good will towards him. One was that he was engaged in my own chosen avocation,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_469_2" id="target_note_LCL216_469_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in which even today I take most pleasure, and showed natural ability, as you know, and considerable application; the other, that at an early age he involved himself in the companies managing public contracts—to my regret, for he lost a great deal of money. However, the common interest of a class which stands very high in my regard made our friendship the firmer. Then, after a record of highly conscientious and creditable activity on both benches,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_469_3" id="target_note_LCL216_469_3"><sup>3</sup></a> he became a candidate for office (that was before this recent constitutional upheaval), and regarded the office as the most honourable reward of his hard work. I may add that latterly he travelled from Brundisium with a letter and oral message from myself to Caesar. I was impressed by his friendly spirit in undertaking this mission and the conscientiousness with which he discharged and reported it.</p>
<p>I had intended to deal specifically with his good character and personality after explaining the reason why I have so high a regard for him, but it seems to me that in doing the latter I have sufficiently covered the former. However, I do specifically promise and personally guarantee that he will make you a pleasant and useful associate. You will find him a man of modesty and good sense, a stranger to any form of self-seeking, hard-working and painstaking furthermore in the highest degree.</p>
