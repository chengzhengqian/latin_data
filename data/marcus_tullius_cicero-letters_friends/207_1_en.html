Their numbers are small, and those there are scatter at sight of danger. My gallant colleague, M. Bibulus, gave his verdict on this description of troops in Asia when he declined to hold a levy, although you had given him permission. As for the auxiliaries supplied by our allies, the harshness and injustices of our rule have rendered them either so weak as to be of little use or so disaffected that it would appear imprudent to expect anything from them or entrust anything to them.

Cappadocia is a vacuum; the remaining kings and rulers are undependable in point both of resources and of loyalty. Few as our numbers are, I shall assuredly not be found wanting in courage, nor yet, I trust, in judgement. What will happen no man can tell. I pray that I may be able to provide for our safety, as I certainly shall for our honour.</p>
