would be out of character for us to entertain any doubt or apprehension concerning yourself. But having placed ourselves in your hands and dismissed our friends from the municipalities on your advice, having done that moreover not only by edict but in private letters, we surely deserve to share your confidence, particularly in a matter which concerns us. Therefore we request you to inform us of your disposition towards us, whether you think we shall be safe among such a multitude of veteran soldiers, who are actually thinking, so we hear, of replacing the altar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_109_2" id="target_note_LCL230_109_2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is not easy to believe that anyone who desires our security and dignity can desire and approve of that.</p>
<p>The event shows that peace has been our aim from the beginning, and that we have had no object in view but the freedom of the community. Nobody can deceive us except yourself, a thing surely abhorrent to your manly and honourable spirit. Still, no other man has the means to trick us, for we have trusted, and shall continue to trust, only you. Our friends are deeply anxious on our behalf. They have every confidence in your good faith, but it is in their minds that the crowd of veterans can more easily be impelled by others in any direction they please than held in check by you.</p>
<p>We request you to give us your reply on all points. As for the allegation that the veterans were summoned because you intended to bring matters to their advantage before the Senate in June, it is a quite frivolous and nugatory excuse. Who do you suppose is likely to be obstructive, since, as for ourselves, it is certain that we shall hold our peace? None should believe us overly anxious to preserve our lives, for nothing can happen to us without universal ruin and chaos.</p>
