the morning of the Ides): The resolution put forward by Hortensius, myself, and Lucullus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_83_3" id="target_note_LCL205_83_3"><sup>3</sup></a> gives way to the religious objection as regards an army; we cannot gain our point in any other way. But in accordance with the decree which was passed on your own motion it gives you authority to restore the king, if you can do so without prejudice to the public interest. While an army is precluded by the religious obstacle, the Senate would thus retain you as the person responsible. Crassus proposes a Commission of Three, from which he does not exclude Pompey, since he provides that persons holding military command<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_83_4" id="target_note_LCL205_83_4"><sup>4</sup></a> shall be eligible. Bibulus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_83_5" id="target_note_LCL205_83_5"><sup>5</sup></a> proposes a Commission of Three to be selected from those <span class="italic">not</span> holding command. He is supported by the other Consulars excepting Servilius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_83_6" id="target_note_LCL205_83_6"><sup>6</sup></a> who is against <span class="italic">any</span> restoration, Volcacius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_83_7" id="target_note_LCL205_83_7"><sup>7</sup></a> who is for authorizing Pompey on Lupus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_83_8" id="target_note_LCL205_83_8"><sup>8</sup></a> motion, and Afranius, who supports Volcacius. The last circumstance intensifies suspicion as to Pompey’s wishes—support for Volcacius by Pompey’s intimates did not go unmarked. It is a hard struggle, and things are going against us. Energetic lobbying by Libo and Hypsaeus, which is no secret, and the interest shown by all Pompey’s friends have led to the opinion that Pompey is anxious for the assignment. Those who are against him are no friends to you either, because of what you have done for him.</p>
<p>I carry less weight in the matter because of my obligations to you, and my private influence is nullified by the prevailing suspicion—they think they are obliging Pompey. We are dealing with a business that was inflamed in se­cret
