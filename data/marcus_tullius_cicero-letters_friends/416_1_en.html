of it, why is he angry with somebody for writing something to his displeasure, when he has pardoned all the folk who often prayed heaven for his destruction?</p>
<p>But to resume, the reason for our nervousness was this: I have written about yourself, sparingly and gingerly enough upon my word,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_363_3" id="target_note_LCL216_363_3"><sup>3</sup></a> not only keeping myself in check but almost running the other way. Now we all know that this type of composition<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_363_4" id="target_note_LCL216_363_4"><sup>4</sup></a> calls for freedom, indeed for excitement and enthusiasm. Attack upon another person is held to be licensed; all the same one has to be on one’s guard against degenerating into bullying. Praise of self is held to be fraught with embarrassment—the vice of arrogance is at its heels. Only praise of others is regarded as completely uninhibited, for any stinting is ascribed to fickleness or jealousy. But perhaps it was more agreeable and convenient to you so. What I could not do supremely well it would have been best to leave alone, but the second-best kindness was to do it very sparingly. Anyhow, restrain myself I did. Much I toned down, deleted much else, and there was a good deal that never got on paper. Think of a ladder. If you take away some of the rungs, and hack into others, and leave others loose, you will be setting a booby trap, not constructing a means of ascent. So with my literary endeavour. Clogged and fractured by so many adversities, how can it produce anything fit to hear or worthy of approval?</p>

Imagine my feelings when I take counsel with myself: ‘He’ll like that. But this word might be misconstrued. Well then, suppose I change it—but I’m afraid I may make matters
