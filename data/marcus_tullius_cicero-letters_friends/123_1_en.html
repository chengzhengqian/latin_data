Consul Sulpicius said he would not allow it. I protested at length, but in face of the Senateâ€™s unanimous desire for me to leave without delay I had no choice but to comply, as I have done.</p>
<p>Let me now repeat the request I made in the letter which I gave your couriers in Rome. I hope you will do whatever can be done by an outgoing governor to ease matters for a successor to whom he is bound by close ties of friendship. Bearing in mind the perfect harmony of sentiment which exists between us, employ your care and diligence in this regard, so that all may understand that I could have had no more benevolent predecessor and that you could not have handed over your province to a better friend.</p>
<p>I understood from the dispatch which you desired to be read aloud in the Senate, of which you sent me a copy, that you had given large numbers of soldiers their discharge. Fabius, however, has explained that you had proposed to do this, but that at the time he left you numbers were still up to complement. If that is so, I shall be very grateful if you make the minimum of reductions in the meagre forces under your command. I think the decrees passed by the Senate on this subject have been sent to you. For my part, my regard for you is such that whatever you do will have my approval, but I feel sure that you on your side will take such measures as you see to be most convenient for me.</p>
<p>I am waiting for my Legate C. Pomptinus at Brundisium, and expect him to arrive before the beginning of June. When he does, we shall sail at the first opportunity.</p>
