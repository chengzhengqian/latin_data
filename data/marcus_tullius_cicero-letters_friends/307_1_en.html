175 (IX.1)
<span class="salute">CICERO TO VARRO</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, 47 (end) or 46 (beginning</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to M. Varro greetings.</p>
<p>The letter which you sent to Atticus and which he read to me informed me of your doings and whereabouts, but as to when we are to see you, I could not so much as make a guess from that letter. However, I am coming to hope that your advent is not far away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_145_1" id="target_note_LCL216_145_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I wish I may find some comfort in it, though our afflictions are so many and so grievous that nobody but an arrant fool ought to hope for any relief. And yet either you may be able to help me or perhaps I may in some way be able to help you. For I should tell you that since my return I have restored my relations with my old friends, that is to say my books. Not that I had renounced their companionship because I was annoyed with themâ€”it was because they gave me a sense of shame. I felt that in casting myself into a turmoil of events with altogether untrustworthy associates I had failed in obedience to their precepts. They forgive me. They call me back to the old intercourse and tell me that you in staying faithful to it were wiser than I. And so I have made my peace with them and we are together again. That is why I think I may properly hope that once I see you I shall find both present and impending troubles easy to bear.</p>
<p>So whatever rendezvous you favour, be it Tusculum or Cumae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_145_2" id="target_note_LCL216_145_2"><sup>2</sup></a> my house or yours, or (what would be my last choice) Rome, you may be sure I shall make it appear the most convenient for both of us, only provided we are together.</p>
