<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Camp on the Pyramus, 26 June (?) 50</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Appius Pulcher, Censor (I hope), greetings.</p>
<p>Two letters from you were delivered to me in camp on the river Pyramus at the same time, sent on to me from Tarsus by Q. Servilius. One of them was dated the Nones of April; the other seemed to me more recent, but bore no date. I shall therefore reply first to the former, in which you write of your acquittal on the charge of lèse-majesté. I had been informed of this long before by letters and oral messages and general report—it was in all mouths; not that anyone expected a different result, but tidings concerning distinguished reputations seldom lack advertisement. Your letter, however, added to my pleasure in the event. It spoke more distinctly and fully than the common talk, and I had a more vivid sense of congratulating you as I heard your news from yourself. So in my mind I embraced you from afar and kissed the letter, congratulating myself as well as you. For I feel the tribute paid by the whole people and the Senate and the jury to talent, energy, and virtue as paid also to me, flattering myself perhaps in fancying that I possess these qualities.</p>
