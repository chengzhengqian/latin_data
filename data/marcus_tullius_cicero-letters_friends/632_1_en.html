<span class="salute">LEPIDUS TO CICERO</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Camp at Pons Argenteus, 22 May 43</span></p>
<p class="noindent">M. Lepidus, Imperator for the second time, Pontifex Maximus, to M. Tullius Cicero greetings.</p>
<p>You and I have always vied in the eagerness of our mutual zeal to do one another service in virtue of the friendship between us, and both of us have been careful to maintain our practice accordingly. At the same time I have no doubt that in the present violent and unexpected political disturbance my detractors have brought you false and unworthy reports concerning me, calculated to give your patriotic heart no small disquiet. My agents have informed me that you have not allowed these rumours to upset you or thought it right to give them hasty credence. For that I am deeply and duly grateful. I also remember your earlier friendly efforts to promote and enhance my standing; they will ever remain firmly rooted in my mind.</p>
<p>I have one earnest request to make of you, my dear Cicero. If in time past my life and endeavour, my diligence and good faith in the conduct of public affairs, have to your knowledge been worthy of the name I bear, I beg you to expect equal or greater things in time to come, and to regard me as deserving the protection of your public influence in proportion as your kindness places me further and further in your debt.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>Dispatched 22 May from camp, Pons Argenteus.</p>
