the end to make good my promises to the state and to all honest men, and to bring to the national cause, not empty hands and loyal sentiments, but the means to aid. I had to confirm the loyalty of the men under my command, who had been repeatedly tempted by lavish offers, inducing them to look to the commonwealth for a moderate recompense rather than to an individual for unlimited bounty. I had to confirm the loyalty of a number of communities which during the previous year had been obligated by means of gifts and grants of privileges, inducing them to regard those concessions as void and to make up their minds to seek the same from those better qualified to bestow them. I had to elicit the sentiments of my fellow governors and commanders in adjoining provinces; for I wished to join with many partners in a league for the defence of freedom, not to share with a few<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_225_1" id="target_note_LCL230_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the fruits of a victory disastrous to the world. I had also to strengthen my own position by increasing the size of my army and the numbers of its auxiliary forces, so that, when I came to make open declaration of my views, there might be no danger in the cause I intended to support becoming common knowledge, even though the announcement might be unwelcome in certain quarters.</p>

That is why the greater part of the communication which I entrusted to my Legate C. Furnius, a gallant and energetic officer, was by word of mouth rather than in writing, in order that it might reach you with less publicity and that I might run less risk.
