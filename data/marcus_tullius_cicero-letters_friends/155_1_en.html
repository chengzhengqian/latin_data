this office because I have delegated the work to someone else. It is not that I shouldn’t be charmed to give time to remembering you, busy though I am and, as you know, the laziest of letter writers.

<p>If you found Pompey, as you wanted to do, be sure to write and tell me what you thought of him, how he talked to you, and what disposition he showed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_345_7" id="target_note_LCL205_345_7"><sup>7</sup></a> He is apt to say
