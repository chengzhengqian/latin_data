my side which might conduce to your interest, honour, and prestige. To the fact that I have received nothing from you in return you are the best witness; that in some measure you have even shown a disposition to the contrary I have heard from many sources—I dare not say ‘learned’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_57_2" id="target_note_LCL205_57_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in case I might be using the very word which they tell me you often bring up against me (untruly). But I had rather you heard of the stories which have reached me from Pomponius (he has been no less vexed by them than I) than from a letter of mine. The Senate and People of Rome stand witness to my conspicuously friendly disposition towards you. Of your gratitude yourself can judge, of your debt to me let the world judge.</p>
<p>What I have already done for you was done at first out of good will and later for consistency’s sake. But I assure you that the future will make far larger demands on my zeal, loyalty, and energy. I shall persevere with all my might, provided I do not seem to be throwing my trouble away. But if I find that it gets me no thanks, I shall not let myself be taken for an idiot—even by you. Pomponius will inform you of what I mean and explain its nature.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_57_3" id="target_note_LCL205_57_3"><sup>3</sup></a> As for Pomponius himself, I recommend him to you, though I am confident that you will do all you can for his own sake. Still, I will ask you to show any regard for me that you may retain in Pomponius’ affair.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_57_4" id="target_note_LCL205_57_4"><sup>4</sup></a> You can do nothing that will oblige me more.</p>
