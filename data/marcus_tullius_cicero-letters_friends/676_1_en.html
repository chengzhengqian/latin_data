<p class="noindent">Plancus, Imperator, Consul-Elect, to Cicero greetings.</p>
<p>I cannot refrain from thanking you with respect to your services in this matter or that, but I assure you I do so with embarrassment. The intimate friendship which by your choice binds you and me does not seem to require expressions of gratitude. And it goes against the grain to acquit myself of your splendid benefactions with so cheap a commodity as words. I prefer to prove myself grateful in person by diligent and assiduous observance. If life is granted me, my devotion to you will transcend all gratitude of friends, all duteous observance of kin. For I should be hard put to it to say whether your affection and esteem will tend more to my lasting honour or to my pleasure from day to day.</p>
<p>You have been attending to my soldiersâ€™ interests. It was not for the sake of personal power (for I know that none but patriotic thoughts are in my mind) that I wished them to be provided for by the Senate, but, firstly, because I considered they deserved it; secondly, because I wished to strengthen their attachment to the commonwealth against all contingencies; and lastly, to enable me to guarantee you that their future behaviour will correspond to their past, proof against all solicitations from any quarter.</p>
<p>So far we have maintained the situation here entirely
