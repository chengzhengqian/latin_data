<p>If you do take any steps to help Appius, be a good fellow and put in a word with him for me. I recommend you to keep your hands free about Dolabella.

<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero, Imperator, to M. Caelius, Curule Aedile, greetings.</p>
<p>M. Fabius is a man of fine character and culture, and on very close terms with me. I have a quite exceptional regard for him, for his brilliant intellect and scholarly attainments go along with unusual modesty.
