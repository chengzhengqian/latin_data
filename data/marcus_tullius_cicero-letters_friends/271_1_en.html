intercourse with him is of the closest, and our friendship goes back a very long way. I do not make any request as to your verdict on the matters he has at issue (you will follow your edict and rule, as your conscience and dignity require), but only ask that he find access to you as easy as possible and obtain such points as shall appear just with your good will, so that he may feel that my friendship, even at a long distance, is of advantage to him, particularly where you are concerned. This I beg of you as a special favour.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to C. Sextilius Rufus, Quaestor, greetings.</p>
<p>I recommend all the inhabitants of Cyprus to your favour, but more especially those of Paphos. Anything you do for them I shall greatly appreciate. I am all the more ready to recommend them to you because I think it is to the advantage of your own reputation (which I have much at heart) that on your first arrival in the island as Quaestor you should set a pattern for others to follow. This I think you will the more easily achieve if you see fit to follow the enactment of your friend P. Lentulus and my own ordinances. I am confident that this will tend much to your credit.</p>
