<p>If you are well, we are well.</p>
<p>The decision as to what you should do is now yours, not mine only. If Caesar is going to come back to Rome in civilized fashion, you can safely stay at home for the present. But if in his madness he is going to give the city over to plunder, I am afraid that even Dolabella’s protection may not be enough for us. I also have the fear that we may soon be cut off, so that when and if you want to leave you may not be able. There remains the question, on which you yourselves will be the best judges, whether other ladies in your position are staying in Rome. If they are not, you should consider whether <span class="italic">you</span> can do so without discredit. As things now stand, provided that we can hold this area, you can stay very nicely with me or at my little properties in the country. There is also the danger of a food shortage in Rome in the near future. I should like you to discuss these points with Pomponius and Camillus and any others you think proper, and, in fine, to keep stout hearts. Labienus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_81_1" id="target_note_LCL216_81_1"><sup>1</sup></a> has improved the situation, and Piso<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_81_2" id="target_note_LCL216_81_2"><sup>2</sup></a> too helps by leaving Rome and branding his son-in-law as a criminal.</p>
<p>My dearest hearts, write to me as often as you can to tell me how you are and what is going on in Rome. Quintus senior and junior and Rufus send you their greetings.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>23 January, from Minturnae.</p>
