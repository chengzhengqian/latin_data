So I hope the other type of letter which I mentioned will become easier for me every day, and that I shall also be in a position to make promises. That I shall do more gladly in deeds than in words. I would ask you to believe that (at least so far as I have been able to judge) you have more friends than most people who are, and have formerly been, in the same case as yourself; and that I yield to none of them. Keep a brave and lofty spirit—that depends on you alone. What depends on Fortune will be governed by circumstances, and our calculations will provide for it.</p>

<span class="salute">CICERO TO TREBIANUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, September (?) 46</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to Trebianus greetings.</p>
<p>How highly I regard you and always have, and how highly I have come to realize you regard me, I am my own witness. Your decision to continue fighting in the civil war, or rather the chance which led you to do so, was always a great distress to me; and the result, that the recovery of your position and status is taking longer than is right and than I should have wished, is a matter of no less concern to me than my misfortunes always were to you. Therefore I have freely opened my mind to Postumulenus, to Sestius, very often to our friend Atticus, and most recently to your freedman Theudas. I have told each one of them more than once that I am anxious to do my duty by you and your children in every way I can. I should like you to write to your people and tell them to regard my time, advice, money, and loyalty (these at least are under my own con­trol)
