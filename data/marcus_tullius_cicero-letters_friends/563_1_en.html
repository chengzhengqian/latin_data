<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Arpinum, November (middle) 44</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Tullius to Tiro greetings.</p>
<p>I sent Harpalus to you this morning, but having a suitable bearer, though nothing new to say, I thought I would write to you again on the same subjects—not that I doubt your conscientiousness, but the thing is so important. The fore and aft (as the Greek saying has it) of my letting you go away was that you should put my affairs straight. Offilius and Aurelius must be satisfied at all costs. If you cannot extract the full amount from Flamma,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_167_1" id="target_note_LCL230_167_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I hope you will get some part of it. Above all the payment on the Kalends of January must be cleared. Settle the assignment and use your judgement about the cash payment. So much for domesticities.</p>
<p>As for public affairs send me full, reliable reports—on Octavian, on Antony, on the state of public opinion, on what you think will happen. I can hardly stop myself hurrying up to town, but I am waiting to hear from you. You may be interested to know that Balbus <span class="italic">was</span> at Aquinum when you were told so, and Hirtius the next day; both on their way to the waters, I suppose—but let them do what they like. See that Dolabella’s agents get a reminder. You will also ask Papia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_167_2" id="target_note_LCL230_167_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for payment.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
