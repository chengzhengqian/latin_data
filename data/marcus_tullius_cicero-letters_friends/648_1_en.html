<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Pons Argenteus, 30 May 43</span></p>
<p class="noindent">M. Lepidus, Imperator for the second time, Pontifex Maximus, to the Praetors, Tribunes of the Plebs, Senate, and People and Plebs of Rome greetings.</p>
<p>I trust you and your children are well, as I am and my army.</p>
<p>I call Gods and men to witness, Fathers Conscript, how my heart and mind have ever been disposed towards the commonwealth, how in my eyes nothing has taken precedence of the general welfare and freedom. Of this I should shortly have given you proof, had not Fortune wrested my decision out of my hands. My entire army, faithful to its inveterate tendency to conserve Roman lives and the general peace, has mutinied; and, truth to tell, has compelled me to champion the preservation in life and estate of so vast a number of Roman citizens.</p>
<p>Herein, Fathers Conscript, I beg and implore you to put private quarrels aside and to consult the supreme interests of the commonwealth. Do not treat the compassion shown by myself and my army in a conflict between fellow countrymen as a crime. If you take account of the welfare and dignity of all, you will better consult your own interests and those of the state.</p>
<p>Dispatched 30 May from Pons Argenteus.</p>
