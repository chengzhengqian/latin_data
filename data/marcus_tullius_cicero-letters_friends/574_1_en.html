undeniably exercise a greater charm. And so your reminder of my relations with your father, of the good will you have bestowed upon me since your childhood, and of other points relevant to the theme, made me a happier man than you can well believe. But, again, the declaration of your political attitude, now and in time to come, pleased me exceedingly. My happiness was all the greater because this came as an addition to what had gone before.</p>
<p>So I urge you, my dear Plancus, nay more, I beg you, as I did in the letter to which you have replied so kindly, to bend all your thoughts and mental energy upon public affairs. There is nothing that can so richly reward you or so redound to your glory; nor in the whole range of human activities is there one more splendid and excellent than service to the commonwealth. Hitherto (your admirable good nature and good sense allow me to put my thoughts freely into words) you appear to have won brilliant success with luck on your side. That would not, it is true, have been possible without merit. None the less, the greater part of your achievements is credited to Fortune and circumstances. But if you come to the aid of the commonwealth in the very difficult circumstances of today, all you do will be properly your own. The universal hatred of Antony (bandits<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_189_1" id="target_note_LCL230_189_1"><sup>1</sup></a> excepted) is extraordinary. Great is the hope pinned upon you and the army under your command, great the expectancy. Do not, in the name of heaven, lose the opportunity to render yourself popular and renowned. I admonish you as a son, I hope for you as for myself, I urge you as one addressing a very dear friend in his countryâ€™s cause.</p>
