what could have been on that scrap of paper which you thought proper to erase rather than not write these screeds. Your forms of procedure perhaps?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_217_3" id="target_note_LCL205_217_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I scarcely suppose that you rub out my letters in order to substitute your own. Or do you mean to imply that nothing is happening, that you are neglected, without even a supply of paper? Well, that is your own fault for taking your modesty away with you instead of leaving it behind with us.</p>
<p>When Balbus sets out to join you, I shall commend you to him in plain Roman style. If you get no further letter from me for some time, don’t be astonished. I am going to be away through April. I am writing this in the Pomptine country, having turned in for the night at M. Aemilius Philemo’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_217_4" id="target_note_LCL205_217_4"><sup>4</sup></a> house, from which I have already heard the hubbub created by my clients, those, that is, whom you have procured for me—it is common knowledge that a vast crowd of frogs in Ulubrae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_217_5" id="target_note_LCL205_217_5"><sup>5</sup></a> have bestirred themselves to pay me their respects.</p>
<p>Take care of your health.</p>
<p>8 April, Pomptine Marshes.</p>
<p>P.S. I have torn up a letter of yours received from L. Arruntius—which did not deserve it, for it contained nothing that could not properly have been read out at a public meeting. However, Arruntius said that you had so requested, and you had added a note to the same effect. Well, no matter. I am much surprised that you have not written since then, especially in view of the startling developments.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_217_6" id="target_note_LCL205_217_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
