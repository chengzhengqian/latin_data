<p>As for Bruttius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_129_2" id="target_note_LCL230_129_2"><sup>2</sup></a> what can I say? I never let him out of my sight.

Also it came to my mind that I should be taking a lot upon myself in judging my father’s judgement. All the same, I am very grateful for your concern and advice.</p>
<p>I quite accept your excuse about shortage of time. I know how busy you generally are. I’m really delighted to hear that you have bought a property, and hope it turns out a successful investment. Don’t be surprised at my congratulations coming at this stage in my letter—that was about the point where you put the news of your purchase. Well, you are a landed proprietor!
