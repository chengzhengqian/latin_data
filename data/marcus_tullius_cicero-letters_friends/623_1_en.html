<p>Would you have me offer you apologies for my brother in a letter—the most gallant of gentlemen and the most forward in every patriotic endeavor? As a result of his exertions he has contracted a slight fever, continuous and pretty troublesome. As soon as he can manage it he will hasten back to Rome without question, so that the commonwealth may not lack his services wherever he may be.</p>
<p>Let me ask you to regard my public standing as entrusted to your care. There is no need for me to be covetous, for in you I have a most affectionate friend and (as I prayed you would be) a most influential one. The magnitude and timing of any benefaction you may wish me to owe you will be yours to determine. All I ask is that you take me as Hirtius’ successor both in affection on your side and attention on mine.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Plancus.</p>
<p>I felt no need for words of thanks from you, knowing how grateful you are in truth and heart. But I must acknowledge that they gave me deep pleasure. I saw your affection for me plain as I see what is in front of my eyes. ‘And before?’ you may ask. Yes indeed, always, but never more clearly.</p>
