<p>For my part, my dear Cornificius, the day I first embarked upon the hope of liberty, that 20th of December on which I laid the foundations of the commonwealth while all the rest hung back, that very day I looked carefully ahead and took account of your personal standing; for the Senate acceded to my proposal about the provincial governorships’ remaining in their present hands.
