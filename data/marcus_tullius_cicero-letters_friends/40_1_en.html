<p>I have another consolation. Everyone agrees that I of all people am entitled either to support Pompey’s wishes or to hold my peace or simply (and this is my chief wish) to return to my literary studies. That, you may be sure, is what I shall do, if the claims of Pompey’s friendship allow me. As for what I had promised myself after attaining the highest state dignities and passing through the most severe ordeals—a lofty platform in the Senate, a position of independence in public life—there is an end to all that, not for me in particular, but for all and sundry. The choice lies between undignified support for a clique and fruitless opposition.</p>
<p>I am writing all this to you chiefly because I want you now to give thought to your own position. The whole face of things has changed—the Senate, the courts, the whole body politic. Tranquillity is what we have to pray for, and this the present holders of power seem likely to provide, if certain persons can submit with a modicum of patience to their domination. The old concept of a Consular playing his firm and courageous part in the Senate must be dismissed from our minds. It has disappeared through the fault of those who lost the Senate the sympathies of a very friendly class and a very eminent individual.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_115_4" id="target_note_LCL205_115_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>But to return to matters bearing more directly on your own position, I know that Pompey is very much your friend. While he is Consul, so far as I can judge, all you wish will be yours. In that connection he will have me close at his elbow, and I shall not neglect anything which may concern you. I have no fear of his finding me importunate—he will be glad even for his own sake to see that I know the meaning of gratitude.</p>
