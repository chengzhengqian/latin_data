enjoy it, left almost on your own in that delightful spot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_173_2" id="target_note_LCL205_173_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And after all, I don’t doubt that throughout the period of the show you have spent the mornings browsing over your books in that bedroom of yours with its window that you let into the wall to overlook the bay of Stabiae. Meanwhile those who left you there were watching the public pantomimes half-asleep.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_173_3" id="target_note_LCL205_173_3"><sup>3</sup></a> As for the rest of the day, you have been spending it in such diversions as you have provided to suit your own taste while we have had to endure what Sp. Maecius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_173_4" id="target_note_LCL205_173_4"><sup>4</sup></a> presumably thought proper.</p>
<p>To be sure, the show (if you are interested) was on the most lavish scale; but it would have been little to your taste, to judge by my own. To begin with, certain performers honoured the occasion by returning to the boards, from which I thought they had honoured their reputation by retiring.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_173_5" id="target_note_LCL205_173_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Your favourite, our friend Aesopus, gave a display which everyone was willing should be his finale. When he came to take an oath<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_173_6" id="target_note_LCL205_173_6"><sup>6</sup></a> and got as far as ‘if I knowingly swear false,’ he lost his voice! I need not give you further details—you know the other shows.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_173_7" id="target_note_LCL205_173_7"><sup>7</sup></a> They did not even have the sprightliness which one mostly finds in ordinary shows—one lost all sense of gaiety in watching the elaborate productions. These I don’t doubt you are very well content to have missed. What pleasure is there in getting a <span class="italic">Clytemnestra</span> with six hundred mules or a <span class="italic">Trojan Horse</span>
