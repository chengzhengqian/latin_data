who were my helpers when I put out that fire<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_313_2" id="target_note_LCL216_313_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in days gone by. In the city where not long ago I stood high in influence, respect, and fame, I now have none of these things. I do indeed enjoy the greatest consideration from Caesar himself, but that cannot counterbalance the violence, the total revolution of affairs and times. Bereft, therefore, as I am of everything to which I had been accustomed by nature, inclination, and habit, I cut a sorry figure in other men’s eyes, so at least I fancy, and in my own. Born as I was for action, incessant action worthy of a man, I now have no way to employ my energies or even my thoughts. I, who once had it in my power to help the obscure and even the guilty, now find myself unable even to make a kindly promise to P. Nigidius, the most accomplished and the most virtuous man of our time, once so influential and assuredly so good a friend of mine.</p>
<p>This sort of letter-writing, therefore, is ruled out. It remains for me to offer you comfort and to try by reasoned argument to divert you from your troubles. But you have in the highest degree, if ever any man had, the faculty of consoling yourself or another. Therefore I shall not touch that side of the subject which starts from recondite philosophical theory. That I shall leave entirely to you. <span class="italic">You</span> will see what is worthy of a man of sense and courage, what is demanded of you by dignity, elevation of mind, your past, your studies, the pursuits in which you have distinguished yourself from childhood upwards. I merely assure you of what my understanding and intuition tell me, being in Rome and keeping a close eye on the course of events: that you will not have to bear your present troubles much longer, but that those that you share with us may be with you always.</p>
