talk, tried to influence my mind in your disfavour, unaware how firmly it is anchored. They said you were holding assizes in Tarsus, making many decisions both administrative and judicial, although you already had reason to think that your successor had arrived—unusual procedure even when a governor expects to be superseded within a short time.</p>
<p>Their talk had no effect upon me. Indeed I can assure you that I considered any such action on your part as relieving me of trouble. My year of office seems all too long, and I am glad it has been reduced almost to eleven months, if a month’s work has been taken off my hands in my absence. But I must candidly own that I am disturbed to find three cohorts missing from my exiguous force, and those the most nearly up to strength, and to be ignorant of their whereabouts. What vexes me most, however, is not to know where I shall see you. That is why I have been slow in writing, since I have been expecting you in person from day to day. Meanwhile I have not even had a letter to tell me what you are doing or where I am to see you. I am therefore sending to you Prefect of Reserves<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_293_1" id="target_note_LCL205_293_1"><sup>1</sup></a> D. Antonius, a gallant officer, one of the best I have, to take over the cohorts, if you have no objection, so that I can get something done before the season is over. Our friendship and your letter had led me to hope that I should have the benefit of your advice in that connection, nor have I given up hoping even now. But unless you write to me when and where I am to see you, I am quite unable even to make a guess.</p>
<p>I shall take good care to make it clear that I am your very good friend to well-wishers and ill-wishers alike. You appear to have given some handle to the latter for misconstruction of your attitude towards myself. I shall be grate­ful
