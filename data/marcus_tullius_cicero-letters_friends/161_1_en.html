From your letters, having seen, as it were, an architect’s drawing of the political situation, I shall hope to know what kind of building is to come. Not that I have any complaint so far. There has been nothing which you could foresee any better than the rest of us—myself especially, after spending several days with Pompey discussing nothing but public affairs. Of what passed between us I cannot and should not write, but of this much you may be sure: Pompey is a very good patriot, ready in spirit and plan for every political contingency against which we have to provide. So court him; believe me, you will be welcomed. He now sees good citizens and bad exactly where we are wont to see them.</p>
<p>I have spent ten clear days in Athens, much in the company of our friend Gallus Caninius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_357_2" id="target_note_LCL205_357_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I leave today, 6 July, after dispatching these few lines. I hope you will take all my interests under your special care, none more than the matter of my tenure here, which I do not want extended. This means everything to me. As to when, how, and through whom to proceed, you will be the best judge.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Caelius to Cicero greetings.</p>
<p>I really envy you. So many surprises landing on your doorstep every day! First Messalla acquitted; then convicted. C. Marcellus elected Consul. M. Calidius defeated, and prosecuted by the two Gallii. P. Dolabella a Quin­decimvir.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_359_1" id="target_note_LCL205_359_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
