However, from what I hear, I hope your arrival is imminent. One reason among many why I am anxious to see you as soon as may be is that I should like us to ponder together how we should best pass through this present time, all of which must be accommodated to the wishes of a single individual. He is a man of sense and generosity, and I think I have cause to believe him no enemy of mine and a very good friend of yours. Even so, what line we are to take needs careful consideration. I am not thinking of any positive action, but of retirement by his leave and favour.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Dolabella greetings.</p>
<p>I would rather my failure to write had been due to my own death than to the grievous calamity which has come upon me. I should surely bear it less hard if I had you beside me. Your wise words and signal affection for me would be a great solace. However, I shall soon be seeing you, so we think here. You will find me in a state which offers plenty of scope for your assistance. Not that I am so far broken down as to forget my human lot or to think it right to sink under Fortune’s blows. But the gaiety and charm which people saw in me, and you in particular used to find agreeable, is all swept away. My fortitude and resolution, however, if I ever possessed those qualities, you will recognize as no whit diminished.</p>
