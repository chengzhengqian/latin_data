folk ought not to be surprised that to be ‘sweet to myself, I must be sour to them.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_305_2" id="target_note_LCL205_305_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I am obliged for your information about affairs in Rome for its own sake, and also because you intimate that you will attend to all my commissions. On one of them I make a special request; please see that this charge of mine is not increased or its period extended, and please ask our friend and colleague<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_305_3" id="target_note_LCL205_305_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Hortensius, if he has ever voted or acted for my sake, to give up this two-year proposal. Nothing could be more hostile to me.</p>
<p>You ask my news. I left Tarsus for the Amanus on the Nones of October, and am writing this the following day from camp in the territory of Mopsuhestia. If I do anything, I shall write to you, and I shall never send a letter to my home without adding one to be forwarded to you. As for your question about the Parthians, I do not think there <span class="italic">were</span> any Parthians. There were Arabs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_305_4" id="target_note_LCL205_305_4"><sup>4</sup></a> some of them with Parthian equipment, and they are said to have all withdrawn. We are told that there is not a single enemy in Syria.</p>
<p>I hope you will write to me as often as you can about your affairs and my own and about the whole state of the commonwealth, as to which your information that our friend Pompey is to go to Spain has aggravated my concern.</p>
