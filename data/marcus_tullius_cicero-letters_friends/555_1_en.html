In a word, high hopes are set on him. He will do anything, it is thought, for honour and glory. As for our friend Antony, he is so conscious of his unpopularity that after catching his would-be murderers in his house he does not dare to make the matter public. So on 9 October he set off for Brundisium to meet the four Macedonian legions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_151_2" id="target_note_LCL230_151_2"><sup>2</sup></a> He intends to buy their good will, and then to march them to Rome and set them on our necks.</p>
<p>Such is the political situation in outline, if a political situation can exist in an armed camp. I often feel sorry for you, because you are too young to have sampled any part of a free commonwealth in sound working order. Formerly it was at least possible to hope, but now even that has been torn from us. What hope is left, when Antony dares to say in a public meeting that Cannutius is trying to make a place for himself with people<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_151_3" id="target_note_LCL230_151_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who can have no place in the community so long as he, Antony, remains a member of it?</p>
<p>For my part, I take all this and whatever else can happen to mortal man with profound thankfulness to philosophy, which not only diverts me from anxiety but arms me against all assaults of fortune. I recommend you to do the same, and not to reckon as an evil anything devoid of culpability. But you know all this better than I.</p>
<p>I always thought well of our friend Tratorius, and I have been particularly impressed by his thorough loyalty, conscientiousness, and good sense in your affairs.</p>
<p>Take good care of your health. You can do nothing to please me more.</p>
