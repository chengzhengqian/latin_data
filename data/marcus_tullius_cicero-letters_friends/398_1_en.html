loyalty and fraternal affection shown by your brothers, whose friendship I have embraced no less warmly than your own, do not permit me to omit any act or occasion of service and good will towards you. But what I am doing, and have done, on your behalf I prefer you to learn from their letters rather than from mine. My hope, or rather my confident assurance, of your restoration is what I want personally to make clear to you.</p>
<p>If any man tends to be apprehensive in affairs of moment and danger, always fearing the worst rather than hoping for the best, I am that man. If this is a failing, I confess that I am not immune from it. But I tell you this: on 26 November, at your brothers’ request, I paid Caesar a morning visit. I had to put up with all the humiliating and wearisome preliminaries of obtaining admission and interview. Your brothers and relations knelt at his feet, while I spoke in terms appropriate to your case and circumstances. When I took my leave, it was with the persuasion, not only from Caesar’s words, gentle and gracious as these were, but from the look in his eyes and many other indications more easily perceived than described, that there was no doubt about your reinstatement.</p>
<p>So keep a brave and lofty spirit. If you have been taking the foulest weather with philosophy, take the fairer with good cheer. Despite what I have told you, I shall lend my support to your cause as though it was one of the utmost difficulty, and shall continue to plead for you most gladly, not only with Caesar himself but with all his friends, whom I have found very friendly to me.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
