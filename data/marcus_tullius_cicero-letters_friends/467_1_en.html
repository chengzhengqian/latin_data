<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to Allienus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_465_1" id="target_note_LCL216_465_1"><sup>1</sup></a> greetings.</p>
<p>Democritus of Sicyon is not only a former host of mine, but a familiar friend, which not many (especially Greeks) can say. He is a most honest, worthy, and sedulously hospitable person, and pays me particular respect and attention and regard. You will find that he is the leading man, not only in his own town, but almost in Achaea as a whole. I would only open the door and pave his way into your acquaintance. Once you get to know him, your own disposition will do the rest: you will judge him worthy of your friendship and hospitality. So may I request you after reading this letter to take him under your wing, and promise to do all you can for him for my sake? As for what may follow, if, as I am confident will be the case, you find him deserving of your friendship and hospitality, I would ask you to make much of him and include him in your circle. I shall be greatly obliged.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>

But the recommendation of a citizen of Sicyon suggests that this letter belongs to an earlier period in his career when he may have been serving in Greece. He was probably Quaestor ca. 62.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL216_465_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
