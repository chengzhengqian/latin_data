all unwilling, Jupiter did rudely force.’ ‘Force’ is very good. And yet it means the same as the other word, which nobody would have tolerated. You see therefore that, although the matter is the same, there is not thought to be any indecency because the words are different. Therefore it does not lie in the matter.</p>
<p>Much less does it lie in the words. For if that which is signified by a word is not indecent, the word which signifies it cannot be indecent either. You say ‘seat,’ using a transferred word: why not use the proper one? If it’s indecent, you should not use the first even; if not, you should use the second. The ancients used to call a tail a penis—hence ‘penicillus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_193_5" id="target_note_LCL216_193_5"><sup>5</sup></a> from the similarity. But nowadays ‘penis’ is an obscene word. And yet Piso Frugi in his <span class="italic">Annals</span> complains of young men being ‘devoted to the penis.’ What you call by its proper name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_193_6" id="target_note_LCL216_193_6"><sup>6</sup></a> in your letter he more guardedly called ‘penis’; but because many others did the same, it became no less obscene a word than the one you have employed.

Very well then, obscenity does not lie in the word; and I have shown that it does not lie in the matter. Therefore it lies nowhere.</p>
<p>‘Provide for the continuation of your family.’ What a respectable phrase! Fathers even ask their sons to do it. But they dare not utter the word for this ‘provision.’ Socrates was taught the lute by a very celebrated player whose
