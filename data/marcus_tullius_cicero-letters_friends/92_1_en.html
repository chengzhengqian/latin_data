<p class="noindent">Cicero to Trebatius.</p>
<p>Chrysippus Vettius, Cyrus the architect’s freedman, has made me think that you have some recollection of my existence; he has given me your kind regards. Very grand we have become! Was it too much trouble to give him a letter for me, and him practically one of my own household? If, however, you have forgotten how to put pen to paper, you will have fewer clients in future to lose their cases! If I have slipped your mind, I’ll make shift to come to Gaul myself before I fade out of it completely. But if it is apprehension of the summer campaign that is sapping your energies, you must think up an excuse, as you did in the matter of Britain.</p>
<p>One thing I was greatly pleased to hear from the same Chrysippus, that you are on close terms with Caesar. But I must say, I would rather have learned how you are getting on from your own letters as often as possible; it would have been more fitting. No doubt that is the way it would be if you had cared to study the rules of friendship as thoroughly as those of court procedure.</p>
<p>But all this is badinage in your own style—and a little in mine too. I am very fond of you, and not only want you to be fond of me but am confident that you are.</p>
