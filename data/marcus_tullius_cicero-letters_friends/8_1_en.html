to your old enemies, nowadays your friends;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_51_3" id="target_note_LCL205_51_3"><sup>3</sup></a> their high hopes dashed, they despond.</p>
<p>Your personal letter to me evinces but little of your friendly sentiments towards me, but you may be sure that it gave me pleasure all the same. My chief joy is apt to lie in the consciousness of my services to others. If these fail of a like response, I am perfectly content that the balance of good offices should rest on my side. I have no doubt that if my own hearty good will towards you does not suffice to win your attachment, the public interest will join us in confederacy.</p>
<p>Not to leave you in ignorance of the particular in which your letter has disappointed me, let me speak plainly, as becomes my character and our friendly relations. My achievements<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_51_4" id="target_note_LCL205_51_4"><sup>4</sup></a> have been such that I expected to find a word of congratulation upon them in your letter, both for friendship’s sake and that of the commonwealth. I imagine you omitted anything of the sort for fear of giving offence in any quarter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_51_5" id="target_note_LCL205_51_5"><sup>5</sup></a> But I must tell you that what I have done for the safety of the country stands approved in the judgement and testimony of the whole world. When you return, you will find that I have acted with a measure of policy and a lack of self-regard which will make you well content to have me as your political ally and private friend—a not much lesser Laelius to a far greater Africanus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_51_6" id="target_note_LCL205_51_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
