<span class="salute">CICERO TO SERVILIUS ISAURICUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, 46â€“44</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to P. Servilius, Proconsul, greetings.</p>
<p>In all my province of Cilicia (to which, as you know, three districts of Asia were assigned) there was nobody with whom I was on a more friendly footing than with Andro, son of Artemo, of Laodicea. He was my host in that town and one that eminently suited my way of life and daily habit. Since leaving the province, I have come to value him far more even than at the time, having experienced in many contexts his grateful disposition and mindfulness of me. I was therefore very glad to see him in Rome. You, who have done good turns to so many people in your province, are well aware that the proportion of the grateful is less than overwhelming.</p>
<p>I have written the above to let you realize that my concern is not idle, and so that you yourself may account him worthy to be your host. You will oblige me very much indeed if you make it plain to him how much you think of me; that is to say, if you take him under your wing, and help him in every way you can with propriety and without inconvenience to yourself. That will oblige me indeed, and I would earnestly beg you so to do.</p>
