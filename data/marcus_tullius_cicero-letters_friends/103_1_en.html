<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, July (?) 53</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to C. Curio greetings.</p>
<p>As I dispatch this letter by the hand of my dear Milo’s friend, Sex. Villius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_241_1" id="target_note_LCL205_241_1"><sup>1</sup></a> no news has yet come in of your approaching Italy. But your arrival is thought not to be far off, and reports agree that you have set out from Asia on your way to Rome. So, considering the importance of the matter in hand, I feel no scruples on the score of undue haste, for I am very anxious that you should get this letter at the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p>If obligations between us were all on your side, and my services to you had been such as you are apt to proclaim them rather than as I myself appraise them, I should approach you with some diffidence if I had to beg you for an important favour. It is not easy for a man of sensibility to ask a great deal of someone who he thinks has reason to be grateful to him. He will be afraid of presenting the appearance of a creditor demanding payment rather than of a petitioner seeking a kindness. But in fact your benefactions to me are great and notorious, rendered the more conspicuous by the strange turns of fortune through which I have passed. And it is the mark of a liberal spirit to wish to owe more where one already owes much. Therefore I do not hesitate to write to you with a request of the highest consequence, one that lies very near to my heart. After all, I am not afraid of succumbing under the load of your good offices, past number though they may be. Whatever favour
