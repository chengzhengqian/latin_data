you all this now, so that you may be hopeful that you are getting what you prayed for.</p>
<p>However, to return to the Parthians, we can feel tolerably pleased with the final result of this summerâ€™s operations. Next summer is an alarming prospect. So keep alert, my good Rufus. First try to get my successor appointed. But if, as you write and I suppose, that is going to be rather sticky, see that my tenure is not extended, which is easy. On politics, as I wrote to you earlier, I expect from your letters the present and still more the future. So please write everything to me in full detail.</p>

<span class="salute">CAELIUS RUFUS TO CICERO</span>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, 17 November 51</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Caelius to Cicero greetings.</p>
<p>We have been uncommonly alarmed by dispatches from C. Cassius and Deiotarus. Cassius has written announcing that Parthian forces are this side of the Euphrates, Deiotarus that they are advancing through Commagene into our province. For my part, the principal fear I had as regards yourself (knowing the extent of your military resources) was that this flare-up might endanger your reputation. If your military resources had been greater, I should have felt anxious about your personal safety, but, being as meagre as they are, I thought they augured retreat, not battle. I was nervous about the way such news would be received and how far the necessity would be appreciated. Nervous I still am, and I shall not stop worrying until I hear you are on Italian soil.</p>
