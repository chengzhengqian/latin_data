yours, please let me know where they are, and when they are sent for, and by what mode of transport. If Damasippus changes his mind, I shall find some Damasippus <span class="italic">manqué,</span> even if it means taking a loss.</p>
<p>You write again about the house. I had already given directions on this head to my girl Tullia as I was leaving—I got your letter that same hour. I had also taken it up with your friend Nicias, since he is on familiar terms with Crassus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_269_7" id="target_note_LCL216_269_7"><sup>7</sup></a> as you know. On my return, before I read this last letter of yours, I asked Tullia how she had got on. She said she had gone to work through Licinia (I have an impression, though, that Crassus does not have a great deal to do with his sister), and that Licinia in her turn said that while her husband was away (Dexius has left for Spain) she did not venture to move house in his absence and without his knowledge. I take it very kindly that you set so much store on our friendly day-to-day intercourse that you took a house so as to live not only in my neighbourhood but in my actual company, and that you are in such a hurry to move. But on my life I won’t admit that you are any more eager for that arrangement than myself. So I shall try every way, conscious as I am of what it means to me and to both of us. If I have any success, I’ll let you know. Write back on all points and inform me, if you will, when I am to expect you.</p>

Cassius’ brother Lucius; and Licinia was his half-sister. But the change is very probable. Crassus will be the ‘Triumvir’s’ surviving son, M.
