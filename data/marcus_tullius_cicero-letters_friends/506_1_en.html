<p>My relations of hospitality with Lyso,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_53_1" id="target_note_LCL230_53_1"><sup>1</sup></a> son of Lyso, of Lilybaeum, go back to his grandfather. He is most attentive to me, and I find him worthy of his grandfather and fatherâ€”it is a very distinguished family. Therefore I particularly recommend his property and domestic circle to your notice, and earnestly request you to make him realize that my recommendation has tended to his great honour and advantage in your eyes.</p>

<p>C. Avianius Philoxenus is an old host of mine and, apart from relations of hospitality, my very good friend. Caesar through my good offices entered him as a citizen of Novum Comum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_53_1a" id="target_note_LCL230_53_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> He took the name of Avianius because of his especially close relations with Flaccus Avianius, a very good friend of mine, as I think you know. I have put all these facts together to let you understand that this recommendation of mine is outside the ordinary.</p>
