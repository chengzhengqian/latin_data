to your colleagues. Moreover, the senatorial decree<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_43_4" id="target_note_LCL205_43_4"><sup>4</sup></a> passed that day contained a preamble which, as long as the document survives, will plainly testify to the friendly office I did you. Then, after you left Rome, I would ask you to recollect my speeches in the Senate with reference to yourself, my deliverances at public meetings, and the letters I sent you. When you have put all this together, I leave to your own judgement whether your conduct on the occasion of your recent visit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_43_5" id="target_note_LCL205_43_5"><sup>5</sup></a> to Rome adequately reciprocated mine at all these points.</p>
<p>You refer to ‘the restoration of friendly relations.’ I fail to understand why you should speak of a restoration of relations which have never been impaired.</p>
<p>You write that your brother Metellus should not have been attacked by me because of a phrase. Now in the first place I would ask you to believe that your sentiment here, your fraternal spirit redolent of good feeling and natural affection, has my warm approval. Secondly, if in any matter I have opposed your brother on public grounds, I ask you to forgive me—in public spirit I call no man my superior. But if I have defended my existence as a citizen in face of a savage onslaught on his part, you should be content that <span class="italic">I</span> do not protest to <span class="italic">you</span> about your brother’s ill usage. When I learned that he was planning and preparing his entire program as Tribune with a view to my destruction, I addressed myself to your lady wife Claudia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_43_6" id="target_note_LCL205_43_6"><sup>6</sup></a> and your sister Mucia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_43_7" id="target_note_LCL205_43_7"><sup>7</sup></a> (her friendly disposition towards me as a friend of Cn. Pompeius had been plain to me in many connections) and asked them to persuade him to give up his injurious design.
