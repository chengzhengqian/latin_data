<p class="noindent">From Tullius to his dear Terentia greetings.</p>
<p>In my own deep distresses our Tullia’s illness is an agony to me. There is no need for me to write any more to you on the subject, for I am sure that you are no less gravely concerned. As for your joint wish that I should come nearer Rome, I see that I ought to do so; and I should have done so already, but have been held up by various obstacles which even now have not been cleared. However, I am expecting a letter from Pomponius, and shall be grateful if you will see that it is forwarded as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Take care of your health.</p>

<p class="noindent">Tullius to his dear Terentia best greetings.</p>
<p>In addition to my other distresses I am now worried about Dolabella’s and Tullia’s illnesses. In general, I just don’t know what plans to make or what to do about anything. I hope you will take care of your own health and Tullia’s.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
