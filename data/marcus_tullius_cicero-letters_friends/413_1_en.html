fixed as the limit of your stay. Having observed in all sorts of contexts that Caesar is in the habit of confirming arrangements made by Balbus and Oppius in his absence, I made strong representations to them that as a favour to myself you should be allowed to stay in Sicily as long as we wished. Usually I find they readily promise me anything that does not fall foul of their own ideas, or else they say no and give their reason. But to this request of mine, or rather urgent demand, they made no immediate reply. However, later the same day they came back, and gave me their assurance that you shall stay in Sicily as long as you like, personally guaranteeing that you will incur no disfavour thereby.</p>
<p>Now that you know what you <span class="italic">may</span> do, I think I ought to tell you what in my view you ought to do. After the aforesaid transactions I received a letter from you in which you ask my advice; do I think you should stay where you are in Sicily or set off to see to what remains of your business in Asia? This deliberation on your part did not seem to me consistent with what Largus had said. He had spoken to me as though it was not open to you to stay in Sicily indefinitely, whereas you pose your question as though you had permission. But whichever is right, for my part I think you should remain in Sicily. Its proximity allows frequent interchange of letters and messengers, and is thus an advantage in the process of gaining your pardon. It will also enable you to come back quickly when that goes through, as I hope it will, or the business is settled in some other way. Therefore I strongly advise you to remain.</p>
<p>I shall particularly recommend you to my friend T. Furfanus Postumus and to his Legates, who are also friends of mine, when they returnâ€”they are all at Mutina.
