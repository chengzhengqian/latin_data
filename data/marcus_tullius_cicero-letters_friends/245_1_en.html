appear to be afraid that your earlier letters have not been delivered. All of them were in fact delivered. You covered all items most carefully, and I was most grateful. Nor was I surprised at the shortness of the letter which Acastus brought. After all, you are now expecting me in person, or rather <span class="italic">us</span> in person, and very impatient we are to see you both—though I well see what sort of situation we are coming home to. Letters brought by Acastus from many friends tell me that war is on the horizon, so that, once I arrive, I shall not be able to disguise my sentiments. But we must take what Fortune sends, and I shall try to come all the faster so that we can consult together about the whole position. I shall be glad if you will come to meet us as far as you can without detriment to your health.</p>
<p>About the Precius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_21_1" id="target_note_LCL216_21_1"><sup>1</sup></a> bequest (I am really sorry to get it—I was very fond of him), would you please see that, if the auction takes place before my arrival, Pomponius or, if he can’t manage it, Camillus looks after my interest? When I am safely back I shall see to the rest myself. If you have already left Rome, please arrange this all the same. If the Gods are kind, we hope to be in Italy about the Ides of November. Now my darling and most longed-for Terentia, if you both love us, take care of yourselves. Good-bye.</p>
<p>Athens, 16 October.</p>
