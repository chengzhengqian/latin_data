If this was a compliment, I could not have made you a greater; if an act of trust, I placed almost more trust in you than in myself; if the object was to ensure that nothing should be presented other than to your credit and advantage, I had nobody more proper to the business than the person to whom I gave it. At any rate what the law required was done; I deposited accounts, made up and compared, with the two communes which appeared to me most suitable, since it had to be done in this way, namely Laodicea and Apamea. So on this point my first answer is that, although for good reasons I was in a hurry to present my accounts, I should have waited for you if I had not looked upon the accounts left behind in the province as already rendered. Therefore ∗∗∗.</p>
<p>As for what you write about Volusius, this does not concern the accounts. I was advised by experts, including the greatest expert of them all and my very good friend C.
