<p class="noindent">From Tullius to his dear Terentia greetings.</p>
<p>I hope you are well, as I am.</p>
<p>Our Tullia joined me on 12 June. She is so wonderfully brave and kind that it gives me even greater pain to think that through my carelessness she is placed far otherwise than befitted a girl of her station and so good a daughter.</p>
<p>I am thinking of sending Marcus to Caesar, and Cn. Sallustius with him. I shall send you word when he leaves. Take good care of your health.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>14 June.</p>

<p>As I wrote to you earlier, I had decided to send Marcus to Caesar, but changed my mind because there are no reports of his coming home. On other matters there is nothing new, but Sicca will tell you what I wish and think expedient at this time. I still have Tullia with me. Take good care of your health.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>19 June.</p>
