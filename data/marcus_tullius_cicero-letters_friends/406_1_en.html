I am far more pleased and grateful to find that, when so very few of my friends and relatives and connections sincerely wished for my restoration, you have shown such conspicuous affection and good will towards me. As for the rest, it is such that, given the times, I was quite well content to do without it.

So herein I do congratulate myself; and I shall not fail to give you substantial proof that the man to whom you have rendered your service is your very sincere friend.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>

I am sometimes visited by a sneaking apprehension that you are disposed to take your time about your home-coming. If your eyes were your only organ of perception, I should quite forgive you for preferring to avoid the sight of certain individuals. But things heard are not much less vexatious than things seen, and I suspect that your early arrival will be much to the advantage of your private estate;
