all this unpleasantness, I cannot laugh at it with you—there is in fact a good deal, but I dare not put such things on paper. I do take it hard that I have not yet had a line from you about these matters. When you read this, I shall already have completed my year’s assignment, but I hope that a letter from you will meet me on the road to tell me about the whole political situation, so that I don’t come to Rome as a complete foreigner. Nobody can do this better than yourself.</p>
<p>Your Diogenes, whose manners I can commend, left me along with Philo for Pessinus. They were going to Adiatorix, despite reports which held out no hope of a kind or affluent reception there.</p>
<p>Rome! Stick to Rome, my dear fellow, and live in the limelight! Sojourn abroad of any kind, as I have thought from my youth upwards, is squalid obscurity for those whose efforts can win lustre in the capital. I knew this well enough, and I only wish I had stayed true to my conviction. I do assure you that in my eyes all I get from the province is not worth a single stroll, a single talk with you. I hope I have won some credit for integrity, but I should have gained as much of that by despising the province as I have by saving it from ruin. You suggest the hope of a Triumph. My Triumph would have been glorious enough; at any rate I should not have been so long cut off from all that is dearest to me. However, I hope to see you soon. Send me letters worthy of yourself to meet me on my way.</p>
