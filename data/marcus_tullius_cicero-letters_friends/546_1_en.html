<p>Thank you for your letter—but you should not have been so rude to my little lodge at Sinuessa.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_133_2" id="target_note_LCL230_133_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The insult will rankle with my poor little house, unless you make an <span class="italic">amende honorable</span> at Cumae or Pompeii. So that is what you must do; also you must remember me kindly, and prod me with a literary effort. I find it easier to answer a challenge than to issue one. However, if you drag your feet (a tendency of yours), I shall be the one to prod. Your laziness will not make an idler of <span class="italic">me.</span> More when I have time to spare—I scribbled this in the Senate.</p>
