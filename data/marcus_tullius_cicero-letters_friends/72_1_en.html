me in my little litter.</p>
<p>I have written at unusual length, out of an abundance, not of spare time, but of affection for you, because in one of your letters you threw out a hint, if you remember, that I might write something to prevent you feeling sorry to have missed the show. If I have succeeded in that, so much the better; but if not, I console myself with the thought that henceforth you will come to the shows and visit us, and that you wonâ€™t forgo any prospect of pleasure to yourself on account of my letters.</p>

<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to M. Licinius Crassus, son of Publius, greetings.</p>
<p>I do not doubt that all your friends have apprised you in their letters of the zeal which I put forward on the Ides (?)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_179_1a" id="target_note_LCL205_179_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> for the defence, or even enhancement, of your position. It was too ardent and too conspicuous to go unrecorded. Against the Consuls and many of the Consulars I joined issue with a vehemence which I have never before displayed in any cause, thus taking upon myself the standing role of protagonist on behalf of all that tends to your honour, and discharging more than amply the service which has long been owing to our old friendship, but which the many variations of circumstance had caused me to intermit.</p>
