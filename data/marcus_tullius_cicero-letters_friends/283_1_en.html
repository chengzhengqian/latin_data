the Senate, or rather the meeting of Senators,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_97_2" id="target_note_LCL216_97_2"><sup>2</sup></a> would serve no useful purpose, but that I was afraid of offending one who desired me to follow your example. When the person to whom I refer asked me to come to the Senate, I made it plain that I should say exactly what you have said on the subject of peace and the Spanish provinces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_97_3" id="target_note_LCL216_97_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>You see the situation. The whole world is ablaze with war, distributed into military commands: Rome lies abandoned to fire and plunder; statutes, courts, law, credit have ceased to exist. I cannot imagine anything to hope for, I can scarcely any longer imagine anything I dare to pray for. But if you in the fullness of your wisdom think it useful for us to confer, I will come nearer Rome, though I have it in mind to go still further away and hate to hear the very name of the city. I have asked Trebatius to be good enough to forward any communication you may wish to send me, and would request you to do this, or else, if you prefer, to send me some trustworthy person from your entourage. That way it may not be necessary for you to leave Rome or for me to go there. I feel well assured (in saying which I allow you no less than, perhaps presumptuously, I claim for myself) that whatever we decide by mutual consent will be universally approved.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
