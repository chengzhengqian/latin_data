<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, late June 43</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to D. Brutus, Consul-Elect, greetings.</p>
<p>Although your letters give me great pleasure, your asking your colleague Plancus to write to me and make your excuses in the midst of your heavy preoccupations gave me more. He did so faithfully. I am deeply touched by your attention and thoughtfulness. The full and friendly cooperation between you and your colleague, as declared in your joint dispatch, has been warmly welcomed by the Senate and People of Rome.</p>
<p>As for the future—carry on, my dear Brutus, and try now to excel, not others, but yourself. I ought not to write any more, especially to you from whom I plan to take lessons in brevity. I eagerly await a letter from you—one such as I must pray for.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
