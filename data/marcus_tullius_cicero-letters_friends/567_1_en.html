<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, mid December 44</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to D. Brutus, Imperator, Consul-Elect, greetings.</p>
<p>Lupus asked myself, Libo, and your cousin Servius to meet him at my house. I think you will have heard the view I expressed from M. Seius, who was present at our colloquy. Other matters you will be able to learn from Graeceius, although he left just after Seius.</p>
<p>The main point, which I want you thoroughly to grasp and remember in the future, is that in safeguarding the liberty and welfare of the Roman People you must not wait to be authorized by a Senate which is not yet free. If you did, you would be condemning your own act, for you did not liberate the commonwealth by any public authority—a fact which makes the exploit all the greater and more glorious. You would also be implying that the young man, or rather boy, Caesar had acted inconsiderately in taking upon himself so weighty a public cause on his private initiative. Further, you would be implying that the soldiers, country folk but brave men and loyal citizens, had taken leave of their senses—that is to say firstly, the veterans,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_175_1" id="target_note_LCL230_175_1"><sup>1</sup></a> your own comrades in arms, and secondly the Martian and Fourth Legions, which branded their Consul as a public enemy and rallied to the defence of the commonwealth.
