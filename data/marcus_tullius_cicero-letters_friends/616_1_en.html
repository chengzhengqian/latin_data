I make these requests of you not only for the sake of the commonwealth, which has always been most dear to your heart, but also in the name of our friendship, which I am confident counts for a great deal with you. Believe me, this army under my command is devoted to the Senate and the loyalists, and most of all to you. By dint of constantly hearing about your friendly sentiments they have developed an extraordinary regard and affection for you. Once they realize that you have their interests at heart, they will feel unbounded gratitude as well.</p>
<p>P.S. I hear that Dolabella has entered Cilicia with his force. I shall set out for Cilicia. I shall try to let you know quickly how I get on. And I hope that luck will be on my side in so far as I deserve well of the commonwealth.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself and your affection for me.</p>
<p>Nones of May, from camp.</p>
