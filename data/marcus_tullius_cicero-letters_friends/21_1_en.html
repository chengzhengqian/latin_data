counted on your assistance no less than on your colleague’s.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_77_1" id="target_note_LCL205_77_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Accordingly, I wrote to you at once in terms proper to my present position, both expressing my gratitude and soliciting your assistance in the future. Later it was conveyed to me, not so much by letters from home as by the talk of travellers passing this way, that your attitude had changed. That is why I did not venture to importune you with letters.</p>
<p>Now my brother Quintus has sent me the text of your speech in the Senate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_77_2" id="target_note_LCL205_77_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in which you express yourself in the gentlest terms. It has emboldened me to write to you and to beg you, with whatever urgency your own sentiments make acceptable, to preserve those near to you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_77_3" id="target_note_LCL205_77_3"><sup>3</sup></a> along with myself rather than attack me on account of <span class="italic">their</span> high-handed cruelty. In giving up a grudge of your own for the sake of the public interest you have won a victory over yourself. Are you prevailed upon to support the grudges of others against that interest? If you will find it in your heart to help me, I give you my word that I shall be at your disposition in all things. If the violence which has overcome me and the commonwealth together shall prevent magistrates and Senate and People from assisting me, may I say a word of warning? When you would fain call back the time for saving all, you may call in vain, because there will be none to save.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_77_4" id="target_note_LCL205_77_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

The final words, though general in form, point to Cicero himself (not Clodius).
