<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Acilius, Proconsul, greetings.</p>
<p>Let me particularly recommend to you my host and friend Hippias, son of Philoxenus, of Calacte. As the matter has been represented to me, his property is being held by the state under a different name in violation of the laws of Calacte. If that is true, the nature of the case entitles him to your assistance as a just magistrate even without any recommendation of mine. But whatever the position, allow me to request you, as a compliment to me, to extricate him from his difficulty, and to accommodate him in this and other matters as far as your conscience and dignity will allow. I shall be truly beholden.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Acilius, Proconsul, greetings.</p>
<p>L. Bruttius, a young Roman Knight of quality in every sense of the word, is one of my most familiar friends and most sedulous in his attentions to me. I was a great friend of his fatherâ€™s from the time when I was Quaestor in Sicily. Bruttius himself is now with me in Rome, but I beg to recommend to you his domestic circle, property, and agents with all possible warmth. I shall be very much beholden if you will let Bruttius understand that my recommendation has been of great assistance to him, as I undertook that it would be.</p>
