and service, my effort and industry, are entirely devoted to your advancement. Thus I conceive I shall most easily render what is due both to the commonwealth, which is most dear to me, and to our friendship, which I hold us bound religiously to maintain.</p>
<p>I am not surprised, but I am happy, that you value our friend Furnius as highly as his own goodness and high standing deserve. Please believe that any good opinion or good office you bestow upon him is in my estimation bestowed upon myself.</p>

<span class="salute">CICERO TO PLANCUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, ca. 19 September 44</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Plancus greetings.</p>
<p>As a friend I should not have failed to support the decree in your honour,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_137_1" id="target_note_LCL230_137_1"><sup>1</sup></a> had I been able to enter the Senate in security and dignity. But it is dangerous for any man of independent political views to move about in public when swords are drawn with complete impunity; and it does not seem to comport with my dignity to make a speech in a House where men-at-arms would hear me better and at shorter distance than members.</p>
<p>In private matters you shall find me always zealous to serve you; and even in matters public, if there be some compelling occasion for me to take part, I shall never fail you in your career, even at risk to myself. But in matters which can just as well be settled in my absence I would ask you to wish me to consider my own safety and dignity.</p>
