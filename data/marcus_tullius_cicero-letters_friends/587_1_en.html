Where would I get provisions if I led my legions through his province against his will? Or even if I had passed the earlier stages, could I fly across the Alps, which are held by his troops? Add the fact that it was quite impossible for a letter to get through. Couriers are searched at any number of points, and then are actually detained by Lepidus. One thing nobody will question, that before a public meeting in Corduba I declared that I would hand over my province to none but an emissary of the Senate. There is no need for me to describe the struggle I have had about handing over the Thirtieth Legion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_215_4" id="target_note_LCL230_215_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Had I done so, nobody can be unaware how greatly my power to aid the national cause would have been enfeebled. For I assure you that the keenness and fighting spirit of that legion is quite outstanding. So you must think of me as one who is, first, most eager for peace (I am unashamedly anxious that none of our fellow countrymen should perish) and, second, ready to defend my country’s freedom and my own.</p>
<p>I am more gratified than you imagine by your taking my friend<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_215_5" id="target_note_LCL230_215_5"><sup>5</sup></a> into your circle. But I envy him his walks and jests with you. You will ask how highly I value that privilege: if we are ever allowed to live in peace, you will find out by experience. I shall not stir a yard from your side.</p>
<p>What does very much surprise me is that you have not written to me whether I shall help the commonwealth more by staying in my province or by leading my own army
