you, I have nothing that I think you will be so pleased to read as the following. Learn that your heart’s darling, C. Sempronius Rufus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_373_1" id="target_note_LCL205_373_1"><sup>1</sup></a> has been nailed for malicious prosecution to loud applause. The case? He charged his own prosecutor, M. Tuccius, with assault under the lex Plotia after the Roman Games, his idea being that, if no priority prosecution came up,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_373_2" id="target_note_LCL205_373_2"><sup>2</sup></a> he himself would have to stand trial this year—and what would happen then he knew all too well.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_373_3" id="target_note_LCL205_373_3"><sup>3</sup></a> He thought he might as well make this little present to his accuser as to anybody. So down he went, with no assistant prosecutor, and charged Tuccius. As soon as I hear of it, I hurry unsummoned up to the defence benches. I get on my hind legs and without a syllable on the matter in hand, I make a thorough job of Sempronius, even including Vestorius and the story of how he claimed to have done you a favour in letting Vestorius keep ∗ ∗ ∗.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_373_4" id="target_note_LCL205_373_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

Claudius Pulcher, governor of Asia in 55–53, had been charged with extortion after his return (the case seems to have been slow in getting to court). He had paid over a sum to M. Servilius (probably a former member of his staff) to obtain an acquittal by collusion with the prosecution. He was, however, found guilty and went into exile without leaving enough assets to pay the damages assessed by the court. Pausanias, representing the provincials, then tried to prosecute Servilius on a charge of ‘receiving’ (i.e. receiving money extorted from the province), but the Praetor, M.
