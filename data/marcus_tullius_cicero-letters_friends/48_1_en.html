power of that Order as revealed on the Nones of December following.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_131_14" id="target_note_LCL205_131_14"><sup>14</sup></a> Equally I remembered that after my retirement from office down to the Consulship of Caesar and Bibulus, when my views carried considerable weight in the Senate, all honest men were pretty much of one mind. Later, while you were governor of Hither Spain and the state had no Consuls, only traffickers in provinces<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_131_15" id="target_note_LCL205_131_15"><sup>15</sup></a> and servile instruments of sedition, accident may be said to have flung my person as a bone of contention into the midst of civil conflict and strife. At that crisis the consensus in my defence of the Senate, of all Italy, of all honest men was truly remarkable, a thing transcending belief.

You saw their spirit when you took action on my be­half
