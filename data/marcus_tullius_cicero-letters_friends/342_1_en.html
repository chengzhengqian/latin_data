say of me. ‘What an easy man to entertain!’ Not any more! I have dropped all my concern for public affairs, all preoccupation with what to say in the Senate, all study of briefs, and flung myself into the camp of my old adversary Epicurus. I don’t aim at the excesses of Rome, however, but at <span class="italic">your</span> elegance—your former elegance, I mean, when you had money to spend (though, to be sure, you never owned more real estate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_215_5" id="target_note_LCL216_215_5"><sup>5</sup></a> in your life).</p>
<p>So be prepared! You are dealing with a hearty eater, no longer wholly ignorant of what’s what; and you know how opsimaths assert themselves. You had best forget about your little baskets<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_215_6" id="target_note_LCL216_215_6"><sup>6</sup></a> and your scones. I have acquired enough of the art by now to dare invite your friend Verrius and Camillus (the very acme of refinement and chic!) on several occasions. More, I even had the audacity to give a dinner to Hirtius (think of it!)—no peacock, though. At that meal nothing proved beyond my cook’s powers of imitation except the hot sauce.</p>
<p>So this is the way I live nowadays. In the morning I receive callers—both honest men (numerous, but depressed) and these jubilant victors, who, I must say, are most obliging and friendly in their attentions to me. When the stream has ceased to flow, I absorb myself in literary work, writing or reading. Some of my visitors listen to me as a man of learning, because I know a little more than themselves. All the rest of the time is given to the claims of the body. As for my country, I have already mourned her longer and more deeply than any mother ever mourned her only son.</p>
