102 (XV.12)
<span class="salute">CICERO TO L. PAULLUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Same place and time as the foregoing</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero, Proconsul, to L. Paullus, Consul-Elect, greetings.</p>
<p>I never had a doubt but that the Roman People would enthusiastically and unanimously elect you Consul in recognition of your great services to the state and the exalted position of your family. All the same, my happiness when I heard the news was more than you can well conceive. I wish the Gods prosper you in your high office and that you discharge it in a manner worthy of yourself and your forbears. I only wish I could have been on the spot to see the day for which I have always longed, and to do you yeoman service in return for your signal acts of good will and kindness towards me. That opportunity was snatched away from me by the sudden, unforeseen chance which sent me on service abroad; but I trust I may still see you as Consul administering the commonwealth in a manner worthy of your standing. To that end I earnestly beg of you to use your best efforts and prevent any unfairness to me or any extension of my yearâ€™s term. If you do that, you will generously crown your past tokens of good will.</p>
