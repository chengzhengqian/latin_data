As it is, I want to collect and make good the sums I gave Cassius and lost by Trebonius’ death, also by Dolabella’s ruthlessness or the bad faith of those who broke their word to me and to the commonwealth. This cannot be done unless I have time. I hope you will gain it for me, with your usual solicitude.</p>
<p>I conceive my public deserts to be such that I may legitimately expect not only the favour of this assignment but as much as Cassius and the two Bruti, in virtue both of my association in the great deed and danger<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_323_2" id="target_note_LCL230_323_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and of my current zeal and activity.
