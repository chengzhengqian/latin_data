<p class="noindent">From D. Brutus to M. Cicero greetings.</p>
<p>How serious a loss the state has sustained in Pansa you doubtless appreciate. It now behoves you to apply your authority and foresight to ensuring that the removal of the Consuls does not give rise to hopes of possible recovery among our enemies. For my part, I shall try to see that Antony is unable to maintain himself in Italy. I shall be after him immediately. I trust I can stop Ventidius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_255_1" id="target_note_LCL230_255_1"><sup>1</sup></a> slipping away on the one hand, and Antony remaining in Italy on the other. Let me especially ask you to send word to that arrant weathercock Lepidus, so that he does not let Antony join him and perhaps make us fight the war all over again. As for Pollio Asinius, I expect you see well enough what he is likely to do.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_255_2" id="target_note_LCL230_255_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The legions under Lepidus and Asinius are good and strong, and there are many of them.</p>
<p>I do not write to you thus because I am not sure that these same points have occurred to yourself, but because I am firmly convinced that Lepidus will never behave well, in case you people in Rome feel any doubt about the matter. I also beg you to stiffen Plancus. After Antonyâ€™s defeat I trust he will not fail the public cause. If Antony gets over the Alps, I have decided to station a force there and to inform you on all points.</p>
