inform you, so that you take your decision the further ahead. You know the routine. There will be a decision about Gaul. Somebody will come along with a veto. Then somebody else will stand up and stop any move about the other provinces, unless the Senate has free licence to pass decrees on all of them. So we shall have a long, elaborate charade—so long that a couple of years or more may drag by in these maneuvres.</p>
<p>If I had anything fresh to tell you about the political situation, I should follow my usual practice and describe in detail both what had happened and what consequences I expected to follow. The fact is that everything has stuck in a kind of trough. Marcellus still goes on pressing his point about the provinces, but so far he has not succeeded in getting a muster of the Senate. This year thus passed, Curio will be Tribune, and the same performance about the provinces will come on the boards. You don’t need me to tell you how easy it will be then to hold everything up, and how well this will suit Caesar and those who think of themselves and care nothing about the country.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_371_1a" id="target_note_LCL205_371_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
