my recommendations on a level from a self-regarding motive—not but that your response is more than gratifying both to myself and to all connected with me.</p>
<p>Anyhow, please take it that the family to which I refer, and these members of it especially, are bound to me by length of acquaintance, good offices, and good will. Therefore I particularly ask you to accommodate them in all respects, so far as your conscience and dignity will allow. I shall be very sincerely beholden if you do.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Acilius, Proconsul, greetings.</p>
<p>I am on a very familiar footing with Cn. Otacilius Naso, as familiar in fact as with any gentleman of his rank. His attractive manners and worth of character make my daily contacts with him very agreeable. You will not need to wait and see what words I use to recommend one with whom I am on such terms. He has affairs of business in your province, to which his freedmen Hilarus, Antigonus, and Demostratus are attending. I recommend to you these persons and all Naso’s affairs exactly as though they were my own. You will oblige me deeply if I find that this recommendation has carried much weight with you.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
