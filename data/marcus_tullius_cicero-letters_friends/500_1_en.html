<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, 46–44</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to his colleague<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_41_1" id="target_note_LCL230_41_1"><sup>1</sup></a> P. Servilius best greetings.</p>
<p>C. Curtius Mithres is, as you know, the freedman of my very good friend Postumus, but he pays as much respect and attention to me as to his own ex-master. At Ephesus, whenever I was there, I stayed in his house as though it was my home, and many incidents arose to give me proof of his good will and loyalty to me. If I or someone close to me want anything done in Asia I am in the habit of writing to Mithres and of using his faithful service, and even his house and purse, as though they were my own.</p>
<p>I have told you this at some length to let you understand that I am not writing conventionally or from a self-regarding motive, but on behalf of a really intimate personal connection. Accordingly may I request you, as a compliment to me, to accommodate Mithres in the dispute he has on hand with a certain citizen of Colophon concerning a rural property, and in all other matters, so far as your conscience will permit and so far as you conveniently can—though from my knowledge of him he has too much sense of propriety to be burdensome to you in any respect. If my recommendation and his own worth win him your good opinion, he will feel that he has gained every purpose. So I do particularly ask you to take him under your wing and include him in your circle.</p>
<p>I shall give my most careful and devoted attention to anything that I think you would like or that appears to concern you.</p>
