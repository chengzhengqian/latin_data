<p class="noindent">From Tullius to Tiro greetings.</p>
<p>Andricus arrived a day later than I expected him, so I had a miserable, apprehensive night. I am none the wiser from your letters as to how you are, but still it made me feel better. I have nothing to amuse me, no literary workâ€”I cannot touch it before I see you.</p>
<p>Give orders for the doctor to be promised whatever fee he asks. I have written to Ummius to that effect. I hear you are in distress of mind, and that the doctor says your sickness is due to this. If you care for me, rouse your dormant love of literary work and the things of the spirit, which makes you very dear to me. Now you need health of mind to recover health of body, and I ask you to gain it for my sake as well as your own. Keep Acastus, so that you are better looked after. Preserve yourself for me. My promise<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_223_1" id="target_note_LCL205_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is almost due now. If you come, I will even settle up right away.</p>
<p>Again, good-bye.</p>
<p>11, noon.</p>
