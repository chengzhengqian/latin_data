vouch to you for my part, and to myself for yours too; for you have left me in no doubt how much you care for me. Suppose I put out of account what you did in full public view, when you made my enemy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_259_2" id="target_note_LCL216_259_2"><sup>2</sup></a> yours, defended me in your speeches, as Quaestor took upon yourself the duty of the Consuls on my behalf and the public’s, and as Quaestor refused to obey the orders of a Tribune, even though your colleague obeyed them. Suppose I forgot matters of recent date, which I shall always remember—your concern for me at the war, your gladness at my return, your anxiety and distress when you were told of <span class="italic">my</span> anxieties and distress, your intention to visit me at Brundisium had you not suddenly been ordered to Spain: leaving all this aside (and I must needs value it as highly as I value my existence as a man and a citizen), this book<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_259_3" id="target_note_LCL216_259_3"><sup>3</sup></a> you have sent me, what a declaration of your affection! To begin with, you find wit in every saying of mine—another perhaps would not; and then, these things, whether witty or only so-so, become irresistible when you are their raconteur. In fact the laugh is nearly all over before <span class="italic">I</span> come on the scene. I should have a heart of stone not to love you simply for thinking so long about me and me only, as in writing these pieces you necessarily did. But you could not have thought what you have put down on paper without the most sincere affection. So I cannot suppose that anybody loves himself more than you love me. I wish I could repay your affection in all other ways, but at least I shall repay it with my own; and, after all, I feel sure that this by itself will be all the return you desire.</p>
