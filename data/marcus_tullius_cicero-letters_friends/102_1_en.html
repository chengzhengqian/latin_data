<span class="salute">CICERO TO CURIO</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, 53 (first half</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to C. Curio greetings.</p>
<p>The state of things here I dare not tell even to you in a letter. As I wrote once before, wherever you are, you are in the same boat; but all the same I congratulate you on your absence. On the one hand, you do not see what we are seeing; on the other, you are in a place where your merit shines high before the eyes of a multitude, Roman citizens and natives. The report of it comes to us, not by doubtful and various gossip, but in a single loud, concerted voice.</p>
<p>On one point I hardly know whether to congratulate you or to take alarmâ€”the extraordinary eagerness with which your return is awaited. It is not that I doubt your capacity to live up to public expectation, but I am seriously afraid that when you do come home, you may no longer have anything to work for. Such is the decay, almost to extinction, of all our institutions. But perhaps even such remarks as this ought not to be entrusted to a letter, so I leave others to tell you the rest. But whether you see any ray of hope for the commonwealth or none, you must prepare and train and plan as befits a man and a Roman whose mission it is in sad times and evil manners to raise his country from the depth of affliction to her ancient dignity and freedom.</p>
