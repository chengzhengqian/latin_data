require one. As for me, if I always had a bearer, I should dispatch them three an hour. I don’t know how it is, but when I write something to you, I seem to see you here in front of me. I am not speaking according to the doctrine of appearances of images, to use the terminology of your new friends, who think that even mental appearances are aroused by Catius’ <span class="italic">spectres.</span> For, in case you have not noticed it, what he of Gargettus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_283_1" id="target_note_LCL216_283_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and Democritus before him, called ‘images’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_283_2" id="target_note_LCL216_283_2"><sup>2</sup></a> are termed ‘spectres’ by the late lamented Catius, Insubrian and Epicurean. Now even granting that those spectres could strike the eyes, because they run upon the pupils of their own accord, I for one don’t see how they can strike the mind—you will have to teach me when you are safely home again. Are we really to suppose that your spectre is in my control, so that as soon as I take a fancy to think about you, up it comes? And not only you, who are in my heart all the time, but if I start thinking about the island of Britain, will its image fly into my brain?</p>
<p>But of all this later on. I am just testing your reactions. If you are nettled and upset, I shall continue and file a claim for your restitution to the philosophical persuasion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_283_3" id="target_note_LCL216_283_3"><sup>3</sup></a> from which you have been ousted ‘by violence, by force of arms.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_283_4" id="target_note_LCL216_283_4"><sup>4</sup></a> In this formula they don’t usually add ‘during the current year,’ so that if it is now two or three years since you were seduced by the wiles of Miss Pleasure into serving notice of divorce on Lady Virtue,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_283_5" id="target_note_LCL216_283_5"><sup>5</sup></a> my action will still lie.</p>
