<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Acilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_451_1" id="target_note_LCL216_451_1"><sup>1</sup></a> greetings.</p>
<p>In view of your habitual courtesy towards me, of which I had full experience throughout the time of my residence in Brundisium, I have made bold to write to you without ceremony and almost as of right on any matter which deeply concerns me.</p>
<p>Manius Curius, who is in business at Patrae, is on the closest and most familiar terms with me. I am indebted to him for many services, as he is to me. And, what is most important, there is a cordial and reciprocal affection between us. That being so, if you pin any hopes upon my friendship, if you wish to make me even more grateful for the services you so readily rendered me in Brundisium (though most grateful I am), and if you see that all those near to you hold me in affection, then of your favour grant me this request: Keep Manius Curius windtight and watertight, as the phrase goes, safe and sound and free of all embarrassment, loss, and trouble. I give you my personal guarantee (and all your people will undertake as much on my behalf) that my friendship and your good offices to me will yield you no small returns and no slight pleasure.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
