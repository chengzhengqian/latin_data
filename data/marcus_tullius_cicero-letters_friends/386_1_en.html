<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to Trebianus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_303_1" id="target_note_LCL216_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> greetings.</p>
<p>I should have written sooner, if I had seen what type of letter to write. In circumstances like these the part of friends is either to offer comfort or to make promises. I have not been doing the former, because I heard from many quarters of the courage and good sense with which you bear the timesâ€™ ill usage, and how efficacious a consolation you find in the consciousness of your past actions and motives. If you do this, you reap great profit from the noble studies in which I know you have always been engaged, and I earnestly urge you so to do.</p>
<p>Moreover you are very well versed in affairs and in all the lessons that history teaches, nor am I myself a novice in these matters, having engaged both in study, though less perhaps than I could wish, and in practical experience of affairs even more than I could wish. And I give you this pledge: the harsh ill usage you now suffer will not long continue. The personage whose power is greatest seems to me to be inclining ever more and more towards justice and his own natural disposition; and the cause itself is such that it must soon revive and be constituted once more, along with freedom, which cannot lie for ever in the dust. Each day brings some act of unexpected lenity or liberality. All this depends on shifts of circumstances which are often slight, and so I shall keep my eyes open for every movement and let no opportunity slip of helping and alleviating your condition.
