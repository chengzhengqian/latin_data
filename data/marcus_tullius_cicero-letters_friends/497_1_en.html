you immediately promised his agents all they asked, and that you actually did far more and better than your word. I hope you realize (I feel I cannot say it too often) that I am most deeply beholden on this score. It makes me all the happier because I am clear that Mescinius himself will prove a source of great satisfaction to you. He is a man of fine, upright character, in the highest degree obliging and attentive, and he shares those literary interests which used to be our diversion and are now our very life. As for the future, I hope you will increase your benefactions to him by all means befitting yourself. But I have two specific requests. Firstly, if security has to be given in respect of final settlement of any claim, please see that security is given on my guarantee. Secondly, the estate consists, as near as makes no matter, of those items which Mindiusâ€™ widow, Oppia, has made away with; please assist and find some means whereby the woman may be brought to Rome. It is our opinion that, if she thinks this is going to happen, we shall settle the business. Let me beg you most particularly to gain us this point.</p>
<p>In confirmation of what I have written above, let me personally guarantee that your past and future good offices to Mescinius will be well placed, and that you will find for yourself that you have obliged a most grateful and agreeable individual. I want this to add something to what you have done on my account.</p>
