<span class="salute">CASSIUS PARMENSIS TO CICERO</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Crommyacris, 13 June 43</span></p>
<p class="noindent">C. Cassius, Quaestor, to M. Cicero greetings.</p>
<p>I trust you are well, as I am.</p>
<p>I am rejoicing not only at the national salvation and victory, but at the renewal of your glory. You have excelled yourself; Rome’s greatest Consular has surpassed her greatest Consul. My joy and admiration know no bounds. Surely a mysterious blessing of providence rests upon your valour, as we have often found; your gown is more fortunate than the arms of any other man—the gown that once again has snatched our almost vanquished country from the hands of her enemies and restored her to us. So now we shall live as free men. I shall now have your testimony—the word of the greatest of Romans and to me (as you came to know in our country’s darkest hours) the dearest—your testimony to my affection for yourself and for the commonwealth, with which you are identified. There are words concerning me which you often promised not to say while our bondage continued, but to pronounce when they should be to my benefit. For my part, I do not so much desire to have them now spoken aloud as to know that you feel them in your heart. I would rather myself be recommended to your good opinion according to my just deserts than be recommended by you to the good opinion of the world. I want you to set down my latest actions as no sudden or incongruous departure, but as conformable to the ideas which you are witness that I entertained; and to think me deserving of advancement to a fine prospect of service
