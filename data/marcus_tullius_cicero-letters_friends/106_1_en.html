so deeply as your mishap.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_247_1" id="target_note_LCL205_247_1"><sup>1</sup></a> However, I not only urge but earnestly beg and entreat you in the name of our mutual affection to take a firm hold of yourself and play the man. Remember the lot of mankind in general and the times in which we have been born. Your merit has given you more than Fortune has taken from you. Few self-made men have attained what you have attained, whereas many of the highest birth have lost what you have lost. Moreover, the future of our laws, law courts, and political conditions in general is likely to be such that whoever makes his exit from this commonwealth under the lightest penalty may be accounted highly fortunate. You have your property and your children. You also have me and others closely attached to you in friendship and good will. You will have ample opportunity to spend your time with me and all those dear to you. Yours is the only trial out of so many in which the verdict is criticized, as depending on a single dubious vote<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_247_2" id="target_note_LCL205_247_2"><sup>2</sup></a>and given, it is thought, to please a powerful personage.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_247_3" id="target_note_LCL205_247_3"><sup>3</sup></a> For all these reasons you should take this trouble as easily as may be. My disposition towards you and your children will ever remain what you wish and what is right and proper.</p>
