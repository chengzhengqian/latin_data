purpose concerning your rehabilitation. As for the others,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_391_4" id="target_note_LCL216_391_4"><sup>4</sup></a> I do not suppose you are waiting for me to express my opinon.</p>
<p>There remains the pain you feel at so long an absence from your friends and family—a loss indeed, especially those quite delightful boys. But as I wrote to you earlier, the times are such that every man thinks his own lot the hardest and would least wish to be where he actually is. For my part I rate us who are in Rome as most to be pitied, not merely because in all calamities it is more bitter to see than to hear but also because we are more exposed to every sudden, dangerous accident than if we were elsewhere.</p>
<p>Yet I, your comforter, have felt my grief assuaged not so much by the books to which I have always been devoted as by the passing of time. You remember how sorely distressed I was. My first consolation is that I saw further than others in desiring peace, on terms however unfavourable. That was chance, not any prophetic gift of mine; and yet this empty credit I get for foresight gives me pleasure. And then, a comforting reflection which you and I have in common, if I were to be called upon to meet life’s end, I should not be torn away from a commonwealth which I should grieve to lose, especially as the condition will be entirely unconscious. My age helps too, and the life that is now behind me. There is satisfaction in the thought of a race well run; and I must not be afraid of violence at a juncture which I have now almost reached in the course of nature. Finally, when I think of the great man,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_391_5" id="target_note_LCL216_391_5"><sup>5</sup></a> I might even say men, who perished in this war, I should feel shameless if I rebelled against a like fate, should it be forced upon me. To be sure I set all manner of contingencies before my mind; no catastrophe so terrible that I do not envisage it as immi­nent.
