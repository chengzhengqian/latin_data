you, there too Phanias can be your informant, but I think that I also have a word to say. Please assure yourself that you are very dear to me. Your natural gifts, your obliging and kindly disposition, attract me in many ways; furthermore, from what you write and others say, I know that you are very appreciative of anything I have been able to do for you. Since that is so, I must evidently contrive to make up for what has been sacrificed in the long period of suspension of our intercourse by the acceptability, the frequency, and the magnitude of the services I render you; and since you so wish, I flatter myself that I shall succeed—by grace of Minerva.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_275_2" id="target_note_LCL205_275_2"><sup>2</sup></a> If by any chance I obtain the Goddess from your collection,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_275_3" id="target_note_LCL205_275_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I shall style her not Polias only, but Appias.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_275_4a" id="target_note_LCL205_275_4a"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I was not previously very well acquainted with your freedman Cilix, but after handing me your affectionate and friendly letter, he followed up its kind expressions with words of his own to quite remarkable effect. I enjoyed listening to his account of your disposition towards me and of what you say about me from day to day. In fact within a couple of days he has become my friend—but not so much so that I shall not miss Phanias sorely. When you send him back to Rome, as I imagine you will shortly be doing, please give him your commissions on all matters on which you would like action or attention from me.</p>
