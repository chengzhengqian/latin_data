<span class="salute">CICERO TO CORNIFICIUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, late January 43</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Cornificius greetings.</p>
<p>I do not (and in duty I should not) lose any opportunity of singing your praises and, what is more, of securing practical recognition for you. But I prefer you to learn of my efforts and good offices from the letters of your domestic correspondents rather than from mine. I would, however, urge you to throw your whole mind into the public service. That is worthy of your spirit and intellect, and of the hope of increased prestige which you ought to entertain.</p>
<p>But of this more at some other time. As I write, everything hangs in suspense. The envoys sent by the Senate (not to beg for peace but to give notice of war if he did not comply with their message) have not yet returned. However, on the first occasion that presented itself to defend the commonwealth in my old style I offered myself to the Senate and People of Rome as their leader,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_193_1" id="target_note_LCL230_193_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and, since I first took up the cause of freedom, I have not let slip the smallest opportunity to champion our corporate existence and liberties. But of this too I would rather you learned from others.</p>
