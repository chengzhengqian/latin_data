nothing in it since Tratorius said nothing to me about it. As for P. Luccius, I won’t allow that you are any more anxious to help him than I am—he is a friend of mine. But when I pressed the receivers for a postponement, they explained to my satisfaction that the arbitration agreement and their oath would not allow them to do it. So I think Luccius had better come over. To be sure, if he has paid attention to my letter, he should be in Rome by the time you read this.</p>
<p>You write on other points, especially money, which you thought you might be able to obtain from Pansa (not knowing of his death) through my mediation. Had he lived, you would not have been disappointed, for he had a high regard for you. But now that he is dead, I do not see what can be done.</p>
<p>As regards Venuleius, Latinus, and Horatius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_369_1" id="target_note_LCL230_369_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I emphatically approve of your decision. On one point I am not too happy—you say that to spare these people’s feelings you have also withdrawn lictors from your own Legates. Persons deserving respect ought not to have been put on a par with those deserving the opposite. And I think that if the latter do not leave the province in accordance with the Senate’s decree, they should be compelled to do so.</p>
<p>The above more or less answers the letter which I have received in two copies. As for all else, please rest assured that my own public standing is not more precious to me than yours.</p>
