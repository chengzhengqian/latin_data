<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to Trebatius greetings.</p>
<p>I have read your letter, from which I understand that our friend Caesar is much impressed with you as a jurist. You may congratulate yourself on having got to your present part of the world, where you can pass for a man of some <span class="italic">wisdom</span>! Had you gone to Britain as well, I daresay there would have been no greater expert than you in the whole vast island. But really (you won’t mind my jokes—after all, you challenged me), I am half inclined to be jealous of you, actually sent for by a personage whom affairs, not arrogance, make inaccessible to the rest of mankind.</p>
<p>But you say nothing in your letter about <span class="italic">your</span> activities, which I assure you interest me no less than my own. I am terribly afraid you may have a chilly time of it<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_203_1" id="target_note_LCL205_203_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in winter quarters. So I advise you to install a good stove. Mucius and Manilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_203_2" id="target_note_LCL205_203_2"><sup>2</sup></a> concur.

However, you are a much safer campaigner than counsel.

Manilius (Consul in 149) and (along with other members of his family) Q. Mucius Scaevola the Pontifex. Trebatius of course would catch the echo. But primarily Cicero must be referring to contemporaries (cf. Letter 31.3 ‘Q. Cornelius concurs’). Manilius is obviously the lawyer mentioned in Letter 29.2. For a contemporary Mucius Scaevola see Index. If he was, as may be presumed, a friend of Trebatius, Cicero might bring him in for the sake of the legal associations of his name even though he was not himself a jurist.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL205_203_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL205_203_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL205_203_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup><span class="italic">Saga.</span> Cicero pretends to assume that the unsoldierly Trebatius would be short of them.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL205_203_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL205_203_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL205_203_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>The tribe of the Eburones in northeast Gaul rose against the Romans and destroyed two legions in the winter of 54–53.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL205_203_4').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL205_203_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL205_203_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>Horace in his <span class="italic">Satires</span> (2.1.8) alludes to Trebatius’ partiality for swimming, as well as for wine.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL205_203_5').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
