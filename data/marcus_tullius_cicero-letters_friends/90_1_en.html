<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Trebatius greetings.</p>
<p>I have received several letters from you in a batch, dispatched at different times. In every respect but one they made pleasant reading. They show that you are now bearing your army life with a stout heart, and that you are a man of fortitude and resolution. For a little while I missed these qualities in you, not however putting down your restlessness to weakness of spirit but to your pain at being parted from us. So carry on as you have begun. Tolerate your service with a stout heart. Depend upon it, you will be well rewarded. I shall follow up my recommendation, but at the right time. Rest assured that I am as anxious as yourself for you to derive the maximum of advantage from this separation of ours. And since the caveats you legal gentlemen enter are none too dependable, I am sending you a little caveat in Greek under my own hand.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_215_1" id="target_note_LCL205_215_1"><sup>1</sup></a> On your side, please give me an account of the war in Gaul—the less adventurous my informant, the more I trust the information.</p>

The sender would naturally use an amanuensis for such copies, though other- wise it was considered polite to write in one’s own hand. Cicero jestingly implies that Trebatius’ letters were so similar to one another as to be virtually copies. The quaint notion that Roman etiquette required letters sent as aforesaid <span class="italic">not</span> to be verbally identical is baseless.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL205_215_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
