<p class="noindent">From Tullius and Marcus and the Quinti to their nicest and best of Tiros best greetings.</p>
<p>Look what a charmer you are! We spent two hours at Thyrreum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_31_1" id="target_note_LCL216_31_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and our host Xenomenes is as fond of you as though he had been your bosom companion. He has promised you everything you need, and I believe he will be as good as his word. I think it would be a good plan for him to take you to Leucas when you are stronger, to finish your convalescence there. You must see what Curius and Lyso and the doctor think. I wanted to send Mario back to you for you to send him to me with a letter when you were a little better, but I reflected that Mario could bring me only one letter, and I expect them one after another. So do what you can, and, if you care for me, see that Acastus goes down to the harbour every day. There will be plenty of folk to whom you can safely give a letter and who will be glad to carry it to me. For my part I shall take advantage of every traveller to Patrae.</p>
<p>I pin all my hope of your getting proper treatment and attention on Curius. He has the kindest of hearts and the truest affection for me. Put yourself entirely in his hands. I had rather see you fit and well a little later on than weak straight away. So attend to nothing except getting wellâ€”I shall attend to the rest.</p>
<p>Good-bye once again.</p>
<p>Leaving Leucas, 7 November.</p>
