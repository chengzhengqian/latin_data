do, you rob me of the satisfaction of liberality, conscientiousness, and a measure of business sense (though I set little enough store by <span class="italic">that</span>). (a) Liberality: you prefer to suppose that it was thanks to my Secretary, and not to me, that my Legate, M. Anneius, and my Prefect, Q. Lepta, were relieved of a very heavy liability, which moreover they should not in fairness have incurred. (b) Conscientiousness: you suppose that I neither knew nor thought about a matter so gravely involving my duty, and with such dangerous potentialities, but presented whatever my Secretary thought fit without even having him read it over to me. (c) Business sense: you imagine that the procedure which I rather intelligently thought out was not so much as thought about. Actually the plan of freeing Volusius was mine, and it was I who devised the expedient whereby Valerius’ sureties and T. Marius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_43_5" id="target_note_LCL216_43_5"><sup>5</sup></a> himself escaped so severe a penalty. That expedient has been universally approved, applauded in fact; and, if you want the truth, my Secretary was the only one who, as I could see, was not too happy about it. But I took the view that an honourable man should have regard to the financial welfare of so many friends or fellow countrymen, seeing that the public kept its due.</p>
<p>As regards Lucceius (?), what happened was that the money was deposited in a temple at the instance of Cn. Pompeius. I acknowledged that this was done on my instructions. Pompey has used the money, just as Sestius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_43_6" id="target_note_LCL216_43_6"><sup>6</sup></a> has used the sum you deposited. But so far as I can see, all this has nothing to do with you. I should be very sorry, however, that I inadvertently omitted to add that you deposited the money in the temple on my instructions, were it not that there is the most weighty and unimpeachable documen­tary
