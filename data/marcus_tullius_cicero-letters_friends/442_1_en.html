<span class="salute">LUCCEIUS TO CICERO</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, ca. 9 May 45</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From L. Lucceius, son of Quintus, to M. Tullius, son of Marcus, greetings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_415_1a" id="target_note_LCL216_415_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I hope you are well, as I am—that is, I am in my usual state of health, but just a little worse even than usual.</p>
<p>I have often asked after your whereabouts in the hope of seeing you. I was surprised that you have not been in Rome<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_415_2" id="target_note_LCL216_415_2"><sup>2</sup></a> since you left, and it still surprises me. What chiefly draws you away I am not sure. If you enjoy solitude while writing or engaged in one of your usual occupations, I am glad and make no criticism of your plan. Nothing can be more agreeable even in calm, prosperous times, let alone in these dark days of mourning, especially as yours is a weary mind, needing rest now from the heavy pressure of affairs, and a well-instructed one, ever creating something to delight others and shed lustre on yourself.

The studious avoidance of elision (confluence of final and initial vowels) in this letter was first brought to light by C. T. H. R. Ehrhard (<span class="italic">Mnemosyne</span> 38 (1985): 152f.; see also 40 (1987): 42f.), but the reason for it is a mystery.
