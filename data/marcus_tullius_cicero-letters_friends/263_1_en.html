the future, let me request you, since your kindness is not falling on stony ground, to be all the readier to accommodate its recipients, and, so far as your conscience will allow, to see that the young manâ€™s mother-in-law is not prosecuted.

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Thermus, Propraetor, greetings.</p>
<p>Every day I learn from letters and reports that a major war is in progress in Syria. That makes me all the more insistent in asking you as a friend to send me back my Legate, M. Anneius, as soon as possible. His services, advice, and military experience may clearly be invaluable to me and to the state.

Anneius should return to me before that date.</p>

From what you said when I talked to you in Ephesus I understood that you were very anxious to oblige M. Anneius
