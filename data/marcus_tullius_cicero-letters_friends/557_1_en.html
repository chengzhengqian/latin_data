graver matters supervened.</p>
<p>At the outset of the Civil War, when you were on your way to join Caesar at Brundisium, you paid me a visit in my house at Formiae.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_155_1" id="target_note_LCL230_155_1"><sup>1</sup></a> That to begin with meant a good deal, especially at such a time. And then, do you suppose I have forgotten your kindly advice and talk? I remember that Trebatius was present during all this. Nor have I forgotten the letter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_155_2" id="target_note_LCL230_155_2"><sup>2</sup></a> you sent me after you had met Caesar in the Trebula district, I think it was.</p>
<p>Then followed the time when, whether impelled by my sensitivity to criticism or by obligation or by Fortune, I went to join Pompey. Your devoted service was never wanting either to me in my absence or to my family on the spot. In the judgement of them all, neither they nor I had a better friend.</p>
<p>I arrived in Brundisium. Do you think I have forgotten how swiftly, the moment you heard the news, you rushed over to me from Tarentum, how you sat beside me, talking and encouraging me in the dejection to which fear of the common calamities had reduced me?</p>
<p>At long last we took up residence in Rome. Our familiar friendship was now complete. In the most important matters, in determining how to conduct myself towards Caesar, I availed myself of your advice; in others, of your good offices. Was there any man but me, Caesar excepted, whose house you chose to frequent, and often spend many hours in the most delightful conversation? It was at that time, if you recall, that you prompted me to compose these philosophical works of mine. After Caesarâ€™s return I doubt if you had any object so much at heart as that I should be on the best possible footing with him. In that you had succeeded.</p>
