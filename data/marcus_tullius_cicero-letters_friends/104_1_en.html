you may confer upon me, I feel confident that my mind has the capacity to accept it and the power to make a generous return, such as will add lustre to your gift.</p>
<p>Well then, I have firmly concentrated all my efforts, all my time, care, diligence, and thought, my whole mind in short, on winning the Consulship for Milo.
