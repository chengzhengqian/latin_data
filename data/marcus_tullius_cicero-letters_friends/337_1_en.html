I practise dining at theirs. As for making me an affidavit of insolvency, you’d be wasting your time. When you had money, a profitable little deal would make you all the closer. But now, when you are losing your pile so philosophically, why not take the view that when you entertain me you are being served with a valuation?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_205_11" id="target_note_LCL216_205_11"><sup>11</sup></a> Such a knock actually hurts less coming from a friend than from a debtor. Not that I am demanding the sort of banquet that produces a great quantity of leftovers; but what there is must be sumptuous and elegant. I remember your reciting Phamea’s dinner to me. Yours may start earlier,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_205_12" id="target_note_LCL216_205_12"><sup>12</sup></a> but the rest should be in the same style. However, if you insist on bringing me back to your friend Matris’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_205_13a" id="target_note_LCL216_205_13a"><sup>13</sup></a> bill of fare, all right, I’ll put up with that too. I should like to see anybody with the courage to dare to serve me with the things you mention, or even with octopus the colour of vermilioned Jupiter!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_205_14" id="target_note_LCL216_205_14"><sup>14</sup></a> No, no, you’ll never dare! The report of my stylish new ways will reach you before I arrive, and make you shake in your shoes. And don’t go building hopes on the hors d’oeuvres. I have done away with that entirely. I used to half-ruin my appetite with your olives and sausages in the old days!</p>
<p>But what am I saying? I only wish I may be able to come down! As for yourself, let me dispel your alarm; go back to your old salt fish au gratin. My visit shall put you to no expense except that you will have to heat a bath. All else shall be as usual between you and me. I was only joking.</p>
