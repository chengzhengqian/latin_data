can hardly believe that. Whose eyes are so preternaturally sharp<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_151_4" id="target_note_LCL216_151_4"><sup>4</sup></a> as to avoid every obstacle, every pitfall, in darkness such as this? In point of fact it did cross my mind long ago that it would be nice to get away somewhere, so as not to see or hear what was being done and said in Rome. But I made difficulties for myself. I thought that whoever came my way would suspect or, even if he did not suspect, would say, as might suit his individual purpose, ‘Aha! He took fright, that’s why he ran away; or else he’s up to something, has a boat all ready.’ Even the most charitable (and perhaps best acquainted with the kind of man I am) would have thought that I was leaving because I could not stand the sight of certain persons.

Even when we go away from here, it will be more seemly to appear to have chosen that part of the world for weeping rather than for bathing. But you will judge better than I. Only let us be firm on one point—to live together in our literary studies. We used to go to them only for pleasure, now we go for salvation. If anybody cares to call us in as architects or even as workmen to help build a commonwealth, we shall not say no,
