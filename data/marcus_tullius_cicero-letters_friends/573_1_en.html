If I am as successful in this as I deserve, I shall assuredly not disappoint you, whom I am most especially anxious to content, or the whole body of honest men.</p>
<p>Keep well and remember me kindly, as I do you.</p>

To be sure (in my judgement at all events) love of country transcends all other sentiments; but affection and friendly attachment
