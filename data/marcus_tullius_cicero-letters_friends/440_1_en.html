reputation, and splendid record. L. Paullus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_411_2" id="target_note_LCL216_411_2"><sup>2</sup></a> lost two in a single week. Then there was Galus in your own family<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_411_3" id="target_note_LCL216_411_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and M. Cato,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_411_4" id="target_note_LCL216_411_4"><sup>4</sup></a> who lost a son of the highest intellectual and moral qualities. But in those times their high standing derived from public life assuaged their mourning. I had already lost those distinctions which you yourself mention and which I had gained by dint of great exertions. The one comfort still left to me was that which has now been snatched away. Neither my friendsâ€™ concerns nor the administration of the state detained my thoughts. I had no wish to appear in the courts, I could not endure the sight of the Senate House. I considered, as was the fact, that I had lost all the fruits of my work and success. However, I reflected that I shared this situation with yourself and certain others; I conquered my feelings and forced myself to bear it all patiently. But while I did so, I had a haven of refuge and repose, one in whose conversation and sweet ways I put aside all cares and sorrows.</p>
<p>Now this grievous blow has again inflamed the wounds I thought healed. When in the past I withdrew in sadness from public affairs, my home received and soothed me; but I cannot now take refuge from domestic grief in public life, to find relief in what it offers. And so I stay away from home and Forum alike, for neither public nor private life can any longer comfort the distress which each occasions me.</p>
<p>All the more then do I look forward to your return and desire to see you as soon as possible. Nothing can bring me greater comfort than our fellowship in daily life and talk.
