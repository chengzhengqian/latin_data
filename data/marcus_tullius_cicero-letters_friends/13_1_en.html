exhausted? Shall I <span class="italic">not</span> ask then? Am I to live without you? Perhaps I should put it like this: if there is any hope of my return, you must build it up, and help in the campaign. On the other hand if all is over, as I fear, then come to me any way you can. Be sure of one thing: if I have you, I shall not feel that I am utterly lost. But what is to become of my Tulliola? You at home must take care of that—I have nothing to suggest. But assuredly, however matters turn out, the poor little girl’s marriage and good name must be a primary consideration. Then there is my son. What will he do? I hope that he will always be clasped to your bosom. I cannot write any more now. Grief clogs my pen.</p>
<p>How you have fared I do not know—whether you still have something left, or, as I fear, have been stripped of all. Yes, I trust that Piso<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_61_2" id="target_note_LCL205_61_2"><sup>2</sup></a> will always be faithful. You need not worry about the freeing of the household. In the first place, the promise made to your people was that you would treat each case on its merits (Orpheus, in fact, is loyal so far, none of the others very noticeably so). The position of the other slaves is that if it turned out that my property was no longer mine, they would be my freedmen, provided they could make good their claim to the status; whereas, if I still had a hold on them, they would remain my slaves except for just a few. But these are minor matters.</p>
<p>You urge me to hold my head high and hope for restoration. I wish the facts may give ground for reasonable hope. Meanwhile, as matters wretchedly stand, when am I going to get your next letter? Who will bring it to me? I should have waited for it at Brundisium if the sailors had let me, but they did not want to lose the fair weather.</p>
<p>For the rest, dearest Terentia, bear up with all the dignity you can muster. It has been a good life, a great career.
