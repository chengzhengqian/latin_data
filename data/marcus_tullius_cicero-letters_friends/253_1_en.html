gave me at long last the letter from you that I had been waiting for so impatiently, dispatched on the Ides of November. It greatly relieved my anxiety—if only the relief had been total! However, Doctor Asclapo definitely assures us that you will soon be well.</p>
<p>Now I do not think I need urge you to apply all possible care to the business of convalescing. I know your good sense, your temperate habits, and your affection for me. I know you will do everything in your power to be with us at the earliest possible moment. But at the same time I should not want you to be in any sort of hurry. I wish you had stayed away from Lyso’s concert—you might have had a fourth weekly crisis.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_37_1" id="target_note_LCL216_37_1"><sup>1</sup></a> However, since you chose to put good manners before your health, be careful in future. I am sending word to Curius to do something for the doctor and advance you what you need, with a promise that I shall repay to anyone he designates. I am leaving a horse and mule for you at Brundisium. I am afraid there will be great alarms and excursions in Rome after the Kalends of January. I shall take a moderate line in all things.</p>
<p>The only other thing is to ask and beg you not to take ship without proper care. Sailors with their money to make are apt to be in a hurry. Take no chances, my dear Tiro. You have a long, difficult voyage ahead. If possible, go with Mescinius—he is not one to take chances with the sea. If not, then with some man of position whom the skipper will respect. If you take every care about this and render yourself up to me safe and sound, I shall have all I ever want of you.</p>
<p>Again, dear Tiro, good-bye. I have written to the doctor, to Curius, and to Lyso most particularly about you. Good-bye and good wishes.</p>
