that you would make formidable enemies if you put a slight upon a powerful young nobleman.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_7_1" id="target_note_LCL216_7_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And it will be a slight, make no mistake. You have nobody of superior official rank available, and the young man in question has a better claim than your excellent and irreproachable Legates from the very fact (to say nothing of family) that he is Quaestor and <span class="italic">your</span> Quaestor. I am well aware that nobody’s grudge can hurt you, but I should none the less be sorry to see you an object of resentment to three brothers of the highest birth and no mean qualities of enterprise and eloquence, especially if their resentment was justified. It is apparent that they will become Tribunes of the Plebs in three successive years.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_7_2" id="target_note_LCL216_7_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Who can tell what sort of political conditions lie ahead? To me they seem likely to be disturbed. So why should I want you to fall in the way of tribunician menaces, especially when you can give a Quaestor preference to quaestorian Legates without a word of criticism from anybody? If he proves himself worthy of his forbears, as I expect and hope he will, some part of the credit will go to you. If he stumbles, the damage will be entirely his, not yours at all.</p>
<p>I feel it right to let you know such thoughts as cross my mind and seem to concern you, because I am leaving for Cilicia. Whatever you do, the Gods be with it! But if you listen to me, you will keep clear of feuds and take thought for a quiet future.</p>
