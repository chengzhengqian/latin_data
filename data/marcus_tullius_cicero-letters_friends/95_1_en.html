That made me anxious, all the more so because Hermia, who ought also to have arrived today, has not come. You cannot imagine how anxious I feel about your health. If you relieve my mind on this score, I shall relieve yours of every worry. I should write more if I thought you could read with any pleasure at the present time. Put your clever brain, which I value so highly, to the job of preserving yourself for us both. Look after yourself carefully, I repeat.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>P.S. Hermia has arrived and I have received your letter, shakily written, poor fellowâ€”no wonder, when you are so seriously ill. I have sent you Aegypta to be with you. He is not uncivilized and I think he is fond of you. Also a cook for your use.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
