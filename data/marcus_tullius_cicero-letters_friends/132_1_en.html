what the tax farmers asked me to transfer verbatim from your edict into mine, when they waited upon me at Samos. The section directed to reducing the expenses of the communes was very carefully worded. It contains some novelties beneficial to the communes, in which I take much satisfaction, but the passage which has given rise to the suspicion that I went out of my way to cross you is common form. I was not so irrational as to suppose that these deputations were in a private interest, sent as they were to express gratitude to you, no private individual, for a matter not private to themselves but public, and in no private conclave but before the parliament of the world; that is to say, the Senate. And when I laid down that no one should leave without my authority, I did <span class="italic">not</span> eliminate persons unable to follow me to my camps or to the other side of the Taurusâ€”this is the most ludicrous point in your letter. Why should they have to follow me to my camps or to cross the Taurus, when I so managed my journey from Laodicea to Iconium that the magistrates and deputations of all districts our side of the Taurus and of their appertaining communes could meet me? Or did they start appointing deputations after I had crossed the mountains? Certainly they did not. When I was at Laodicea, and at Apamea, and at Synnada, and at Philomelium, and at Iconium (I spent time in all these towns), all deputations of this sort had already been nominated. All the same, I wish you to know that I made no ruling for the reduction or cancellation of such expenditure on deputations except at the request of the leading men of the communes, lest expenditures of a far from necessary kind lead them into the sale of taxes and those very harsh imposts (you will know to what I refer), the poll tax
