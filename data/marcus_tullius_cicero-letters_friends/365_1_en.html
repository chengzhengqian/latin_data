<p>I come now to your charming and communicative letter, to which there is no necessity for me to reply at great length. First, I sent that letter to Calvus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_261_4" id="target_note_LCL216_261_4"><sup>4</sup></a> not thinking that it would get into circulation any more than the one you are reading at this moment. Now our way of writing when we think we shall be read only by our addressee is not the same as when we write for a multitude of eyes. Secondly, if I praised his talent more generously than in your opinion the truth could warrant, it was first and foremost because such was really my opinion. Calvus’ intellect was keen and quick; he followed a style in which, though he failed in judgement (a strong point with him), he none the less succeeded in the manner of his choice; his reading was wide and recondite. But he lacked force, and I was urging him to make good the deficiency. Now in trying to rouse a man and spur him on, it works wonders if you mingle some praise with your admonitions. So that’s what I think of Calvus, and why I wrote as I did. I praised in order to exhort; and I did think very highly of his talent.</p>
<p>It remains for me to let my affection follow you on your way, to look forward hopefully to your return, to remember you faithfully in your absence, and to mitigate all sense of loss by sending and receiving letters. I hope you will often think of all you have done for me and tried to do. <span class="italic">You</span> are at liberty to forget it, but for me to forget would be a sin. So you will not only rate me an honourable man but conclude that I have a deep affection for you.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
