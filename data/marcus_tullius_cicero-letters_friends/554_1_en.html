inform you of what is going to happen, and that is hard to guess at present.</p>
<p>The whole country is under heel. The honest men have no leader, our tyrannicides are at the other end of the earth. Pansa’s sentiments are sound, and he talks boldly. Our friend Hirtius is making a slow recovery. What will come of it I simply don’t know, but the only hope is that the People of Rome will at last show themselves like their ancestors. I at any rate shall not fail the commonwealth, and shall bear with courage whatever may befall, provided that I am not to blame for it. Of one thing you may be sure—I shall protect your reputation and prestige to the best of my ability.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Cornificius greetings.</p>
<p>Tratorius has given me a comprehensive picture of your situation as governor and the state of your province. Outrages everywhere! But the higher your standing, the less you should acquiesce in what has happened to you. What your lofty spirit and intellect bear equably you should not on that account let go unpunished, even though it need not cause you pain. But of this later.</p>
<p>I feel sure that the city news is sent to you. If I thought otherwise, I should give you the particulars myself, especially about Caesar Octavian’s attempt.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_149_1" id="target_note_LCL230_149_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The general public thinks Antony has trumped up the charge because he wants to lay hands on the young man’s money; but intelligent and honest men both believe in the fact and approve.
