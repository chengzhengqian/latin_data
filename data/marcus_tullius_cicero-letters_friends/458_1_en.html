<p>I say ‘<span class="italic">his</span> friend,’ for I am yours in usufruct, though I belong to our good Atticus by right of ownership. You have the enjoyment, and he the title. If he puts the goods up for sale as a job lot,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_447_1" id="target_note_LCL216_447_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he won’t get much by it. But <span class="italic">I</span> advertise that everything I am and have, my entire place in society, comes from you. That’s worth something! So, Cicero mine, carry on your good work.

<p>And so, patron mine, a very good day to you. Give my regards to my good friend Tiro.</p>

<p>Not so. I no longer urge you or ask you to come home. On the contrary, I am anxious to take wing myself and go to some place ‘where nevermore of Pelops’ line I’ll hear the name or deeds.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_447_1a" id="target_note_LCL216_447_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> You cannot imagine the sense of personal
