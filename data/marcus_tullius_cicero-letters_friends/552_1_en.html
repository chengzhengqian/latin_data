Consulars. Such are the men to whom the country looks for guidance; even for good times an all too meagre number, but for desperate times—I say no more.</p>
<p>So all our hope lies in yourselves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_145_10" id="target_note_LCL230_145_10"><sup>10</sup></a> If you are keeping away for your safety’s sake, even that hope fails. On the other hand, should you be planning something worthy of your glory, I hope I may be alive to see it; but if I am not, at any rate the commonwealth will soon regain its rights through you.</p>
<p>Your family can count on me now and in the future. Whether they consult me or not, my loyalty and good will to you shall not be wanting.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p>Your friend<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_145_1" id="target_note_LCL230_145_1"><sup>1</sup></a> gets crazier every day. To begin with he has inscribed the statue<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_145_2" id="target_note_LCL230_145_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which he set up on the Rostra ‘To Father and Benefactor’—so that you are now set down, not only as assassins, but as parricides to boot! I say ‘you,’ but ought rather to say ‘we,’ for the madman declares that I was a leader in your noble enterprise. If only I had been! He would not be giving us any trouble. But all that is your responsibility, and now that it is past and gone, I only wish I had some advice to offer you. But I cannot even think what to do myself. What can be done against violence except by violence?</p>
