<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Cassius greetings.</p>
<p>You will be able to find out the state of affairs at the time this letter was dispatched from C. Tidius Strabo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_241_1" id="target_note_LCL230_241_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a good man and an excellent patriot—that he is most anxious to serve you I need hardly say, seeing that he has left home and career expressly in order to join you. I do not even recommend him to you. His own arrival will be recommendation enough.</p>
<p>Of one thing I hope you are thoroughly convinced, that honest men can look for refuge solely to yourself and Brutus, should any reverse unfortunately take place. As I write, the ultimate crisis is upon us. Brutus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_241_2" id="target_note_LCL230_241_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is hard put to it to hold out any longer at Mutina. If he is saved, we have won. If not, which heaven forfend, there is only one road for us all—to you. Your courage and preparations must be on the scale needed for the recovery of the whole commonwealth.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
