<p class="noindent">M. Cicero, Imperator, to M. Caelius, Curule Aedile, greetings.</p>
<p>Would you ever have thought that I could find myself short of words—and not only the kind of words you orators use, but even this vernacular small change? The reason is that I am on tenterhooks to hear what is decreed about the provinces. I have a marvellous longing for Rome, and miss my family and friends, you especially, more than you would believe. I am sick and tired of the province. I think I have gained a reputation here such that rather than seek to add to it I should beware of Fortune’s turns. Besides the whole thing is unworthy of my powers. I am able to bear, am used to bearing, greater loads in the service of the state. Then again, the threat of a great war hangs over us; this I believe I escape if I leave by the appointed day.</p>
<p>About the panthers, the usual hunters are doing their best on my instructions. But the creatures are in remarkably short supply, and those we have are said to be complaining bitterly because they are the only beings in my province who have to fear designs against their safety. Accordingly they are reported to have decided to leave this province and go to Caria. But the matter is receiving close attention, especially from Patiscus. Whatever comes to hand will be yours, but what that amounts to I simply do not know. I do assure you that your career as Aedile is of great concern to me. The date is itself a reminder—I am writing on Great Mother’s Day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_405_1" id="target_note_LCL205_405_1"><sup>1</sup></a> On your side, please send me an account of the whole political situation as full as you
