without anybody’s recommendation would have made you as fond of him as I and his other friends. But as I believe him to be away, let me warmly recommend to you his household in Sicyon and his interests—more especially his freedman C. Avianius Hammonius, whom I also recommend to you in his own right. I like him for his exceptional conscientiousness and fidelity towards his former master; moreover, he has rendered me personally important services, making himself available to me in the most difficult period of my life with as much loyalty and good will as if I had given him his freedom. So let me ask you to support him in his former master’s affairs, as the agent of the person whom I am recommending to you, and also to hold him in regard for his own sake and admit him to your circle. You will find him a modest, serviceable person, worthy of your regard.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p>I have a warm regard for T. Manlius, who carries on business at Thespiae. He has always made a point of cultivating my acquaintance and showing me courtesy, nor is he a stranger to our studies. Furthermore, Varro Murena takes the liveliest interest in his welfare. Although fully confident in the effect of his own letter of recommendation to you on Manlius’ behalf, Varro was of the opinion that a letter of mine would contribute something addi­tional.
