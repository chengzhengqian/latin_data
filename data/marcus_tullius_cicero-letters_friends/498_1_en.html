<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, 46 or 45</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Servius greetings.</p>
<p>The Lacedaemonians are confident, I imagine, that their own prestige and that of their forefathers is all the recommendation they need to your sense of duty and justice, nor was I in any doubt, knowing you so well, that you are fully conversant with the rights and deserts of peoples. Accordingly, when Philippus of Lacedaemon asked me to recommend his community to you, I replied, though conscious of my great obligations to them, that the Lacedaemonians require no recommendation where you are concerned.</p>
<p>So please take it that I regard all the communities of Achaea as fortunate, considering the disorders of the present time, in having you as their governor; and, further, that I judge you to be of your own accord a good friend, now and in the future, to the people of Lacedaemon, better versed as you are in the whole history of Greece as well as Rome than any man alive. Let me then request only this: when you do for the Lacedaemonians what your conscience, your dignity, and your sense of justice will demand, indicate to them, if you please, that you are not sorry to understand that I too shall take it kindly. I have an obligation to let them feel that their interests concern me. Allow me to ask this as a particular favour.</p>
