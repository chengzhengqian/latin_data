<p class="noindent">From Tullius and Marcus to their dear Tiro best greetings.</p>
<p>As you know, we left you on 2 November. We reached Leucas on 6 November and Actium on the 7th, where we stayed over the 8th on account of the weather. Thence on the 9th we had a beautiful voyage to Corcyra. At Corcyra we stayed until the 15th, held up by weather. On the 16th we moved on 120 stades to Corcyra Harbour near Cassiope. Contrary winds held us there until the 22nd. Meanwhile many travellers who were too impatient to wait were shipwrecked. That day we weighed anchor after dinner. A gentle southerly breeze was blowing, the skies were clear. Sailing at our ease through the night and the next day, we reached Italy at Hydrus, and on the day following (24 November) under the same wind arrived at Brundisium at 10 a.m. Terentia, who thinks a great deal of you, entered the town at the same time as ourselves.</p>
