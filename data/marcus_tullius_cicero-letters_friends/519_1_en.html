accordance with the will of Caesar, who has entrusted you with so important and difficult a commission. Although I receive many requests from many people in their confidence of your friendly disposition towards me, I take good care not to embarrass you in the execution of your duty by solicitations of mine.</p>
<p>I have been on intimate terms with C. Curtius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_79_1" id="target_note_LCL230_79_1"><sup>1</sup></a> since early youth. His iniquitous deprivation in Sulla’s time was a grief to me; and when it appeared that persons who had suffered a similar injustice were allowed to return to their country, though with the loss of their entire fortunes, a concession which was universally welcomed, I lent my assistance in his rehabilitation. He owns a property in the district of Volaterrae into which he put what remained from the wreck of his estate. Caesar has now appointed him a member of the Senate, a rank which he can scarcely support if he loses this property. It is very hard that, having been raised in station, he should be at a disadvantage in fortune; and it is highly incongruous that a Senator by Caesar’s favour should be evicted from land which is under distribution by Caesar’s orders. However, I do not care to dwell on the rights of the matter, or I might seem to have prevailed with you in virtue of a strong case rather than by my personal influence. So let me particularly request you to regard C. Curtius’ estate as mine, to do for C. Curtius’ sake whatever you would do for mine, and, having done it, to consider that whatever comes to him through my intervention is a gift from you to me. This I most earnestly beg of you.</p>
