sorry you tore up. I have it safe at home.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_441_1" id="target_note_LCL216_441_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You can ask for it any time you like. As for your word of warning, I’m very grateful, and hope you will always so favour me.

<p>Attention now! No more writing!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_441_3" id="target_note_LCL216_441_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Here comes the beak, sooner than expected! It’s the cat for Catonians, I fear.</p>

So press on and don’t budge a nail’s breadth, as they say, from your pen. The pen makes the author! For my own part, I work o’nights nowadays as well as in the daytime.</p>

The letter was probably Letter 260. Probably a relative of Lepta who had died leaving him money; cf. the beginning of <span class="italic">Letters to Atticus</span> 65 (III.20). Lepta seems to have suggested that Cicero might like to acquire part of the estate, a small property in the Falernian district eastward of Sinuessa, as a lodge for use on his journeys up and down the Appian Way; cf.
