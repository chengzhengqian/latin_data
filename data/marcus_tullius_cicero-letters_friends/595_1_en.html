<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Cornificius greetings.</p>
<p>I received your letter on Bacchus’ Day. Cornificius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_231_1" id="target_note_LCL230_231_1"><sup>1</sup></a> handed it to me three weeks after dispatch, so he told me. There was no meeting of the Senate that day or the next. On Minerva’s Day I pleaded your cause at a well attended session, not without the Goddess’ good will<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_231_2" id="target_note_LCL230_231_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—my statue of her as Guardian of Rome<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_231_3" id="target_note_LCL230_231_3"><sup>3</sup></a> had been blown down in a gale, and that very day the Senate passed a decree to set it up again. Pansa read your dispatch. The House highly approved of it, to my great delight and the discomfiture of the Minotaur (Calvisius and Taurus).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_231_4a" id="target_note_LCL230_231_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> A decree in honorific terms was voted concerning you. There was a demand that <span class="italic">they</span> should be censured as well, but Pansa took a more lenient view.</p>

Calvisius Sabinus, a former officer of Caesar’s with a distin- guished career ahead of him as a partisan of Octavian. Taurus may be T. Statilius Taurus, later to command Octavian’s land forces at Actium. The nature of his association with Calvisius is unknown, as is the relevance of the first half of the nickname.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL230_231_4a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
