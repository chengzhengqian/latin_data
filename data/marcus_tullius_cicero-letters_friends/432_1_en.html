me, to take it hard that your case has hitherto gone through more ups and downs than was generally hoped or expected. There are three possible futures for the commonwealth: oppression in endless armed conflict, eventual revival when arms are laid aside, and complete annihilation. If arms are to prevail, you should not fear the side which is pardoning you, nor yet that which you assisted. If arms are laid aside on terms, or cast away in exhaustion, or withdrawn in victory, and the state breathes once more, you will be free to enjoy your rank and fortune. If, however, the sum of things goes down to destruction, the end feared long ago by a very wise man, M. Antonius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_395_1" id="target_note_LCL216_395_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when he surmised the vast calamities to come, well then, you have the consolation (a sad one indeed, especially for a man and a citizen like yourself, but necessary) that in what happens to all the individual has no special reason for distress.</p>
<p>If you will carefully consider the significance implicit in these few words (more it would not have been wise to commit to a letter), you will realize, as I am sure you do without any letter of mine, that you have something to hope and nothing, in this or any other state of the commonwealth, to be afraid of; and that if all goes to ruin, you must bear what Fortune sends, especially as your conscience is clear. For you would not wish to survive the commonwealth, even if that were possible. But I have written enough on this topic.</p>
<p>Please write and tell me of your doings and your future whereabouts, so that I may know where to write or where to go.</p>
