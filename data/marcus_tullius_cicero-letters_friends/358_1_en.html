but happy by comparison with ourselves. And your state is better than ours in this very respect, that you dare to put your discontents<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_247_2" id="target_note_LCL216_247_2"><sup>2</sup></a> on paper, whereas we cannot even do that without risk. It is the fault, not of the victor, who is as moderate as could be, but of the victory itself. In civil war victory is always insolent.</p>
<p>On one point we have had the advantage of you. We learned of your colleague Marcellus’ restitution a little sooner than you, and I will add furthermore that we saw <span class="italic">how</span> the matter was handled. For I do assure you that since the start of these calamities, that is, since force of arms first came to be arbiter of constitutional right, no other piece of public business has been transacted with dignity. Caesar himself, after complaining of Marcellus’ acerbity (that was the word he used) and lauding your fair-mindedness and wisdom in the most complimentary terms, suddenly and unexpectedly declared that, if only for the omen’s sake, he would not say no to the Senate’s petition on Marcellus’ behalf. This was after the House had risen in a body and approached Caesar in supplication, which they did when L. Piso had made mention of Marcellus in his speech and C. Marcellus had fallen at Caesar’s feet. Take my word, it seemed to me a fine day’s work; I thought I saw some semblance of reviving constitutional freedom.</p>
<p>Accordingly, after all those called upon to speak ahead of me had expressed thanks to Caesar except Volcacius (<span class="italic">he</span> said he would not have done it in Caesar’s place), my name was called; and I changed my resolution. I had determined to hold my peace forever, not, let me say, from sluggishness, but because I remembered the station that used to be mine and is mine no longer. This resolution of mine was overborne by Caesar’s magnanimity and the Senate’s solic­itude.
