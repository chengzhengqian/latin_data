Therein I gave advice as to the measures requisite for the protection of the common safety and for my own equipment, from which it can be seen that the defence of the supreme interests of the commonwealth has for a long time past been my vigilant concern.</p>
<p>Now, by the grace of heaven, I am in every way better prepared; and I wish my countrymen not only to entertain good hope of me, but to make up their minds in full assurance. I have five legions under the standards; their own loyalty and valour closely attach them to the commonwealth, and my liberality has secured their obedience to myself. My province is in full readiness; all its constituent communities are of one mind, and there is the keenest rivalry in rendering services. I have cavalry and auxiliary forces in such strength as these peoples can muster for the defence of their lives and liberties. As for my personal resolution, I am prepared to defend my province, or to go wherever the public interest may summon, or to hand over my army, auxiliaries, and province, or to turn the whole brunt of the conflict upon myself, if only by such personal hazard I can assure my countryâ€™s safety or hold back the danger that threatens her.</p>
<p>It may be that I make these professions when the clouds have already dispersed and national tranquillity has been restored. In that case my credit will be the less, but I shall rejoice in the public good. If, however, I come to take my share in dire and quite undiminished dangers, I commend the defence of my conduct from the malice of jealous tongues to equitable judges. For myself, I can look forward to the preservation of the commonwealth as an ample enough return for my services. But I think I ought to ask you to regard as recommended to your favour those<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_227_3" id="target_note_LCL230_227_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
