<p>I wrote to Pomponius, later than I ought, telling him what I thought should be done.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_135_1" id="target_note_LCL216_135_1"><sup>1</sup></a> When you have had a talk with him, you will understand my wishes. There is no need to write more explicitly, since I have written to him. Please send me a letter as soon as possible on this and other matters. Take good care of your health.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Tullius to his dear Terentia greetings.</p>
<p>As regards what I wrote in my last letter about sending notice of divorce, I don’t know how powerful he is at the present time<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_135_1a" id="target_note_LCL216_135_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> nor how excited the state of popular feeling. If he is likely to be a formidable enemy, don’t do anything—perhaps he will take the initiative even so. You must judge of the whole position and choose whatever you think the least of evils in this wretched situation.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>10 July.</p>
