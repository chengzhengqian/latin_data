<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Trebatius.</p>
<p>It’s a long time since I had news of you. You don’t write, and the last two months I have not written to you myself. As you were not with my brother Quintus, I could not tell where to send a letter or whom to give it to. I am anxious to know what you are doing and where you will be spending the winter—with Caesar, I hope; but I have not ventured to write anything to him on account of his recent loss.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_195_1" id="target_note_LCL205_195_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Idid write to Balbus though. Mind you don’t let yourself down. Better later back to us, so you come fatter! There is no occasion for you to hurry, especially now that Battara<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_195_2" id="target_note_LCL205_195_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is no more. But you are well able to make your own plans. I am anxious to know what you have decided.</p>
<p>There is a certain friend of yours called Cn. Octavius (or is it Cn. Cornelius?), ‘mother Earth’s son, a fine old family.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_195_3" id="target_note_LCL205_195_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Knowing me to be a friend of yours, he showers me with invitations to dinner. So far he has not succeeded in getting me all the way, but I am obliged just the same.</p>
