showed out there admits of any addition) in proportion as your choice in friendship could be more freely exercised. Your earlier letter gave me great pleasure. I found that you had waited for my coming, which was friendly of you, and that, when the matter turned out otherwise than you had expected, you were heartily glad of my advice. And from this last letter of yours I appreciate with satisfaction your sound principles and your sense of friendly obligation. As for the first, I perceive that you hold, as all brave and good men ought to hold, nothing expedient but what is right and honourable. As for the second, you promise that you will be my companion in whatever I decide to do; nothing can be more agreeable to me, nor, I fancy, more creditable to you.</p>
<p>My resolution<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_103_1" id="target_note_LCL216_103_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was taken long ago. If I did not write to you about it earlier, it was not that it seemed best to keep you in the dark, but because its communication at such a time has somewhat the air of a reminder of obligation, or rather of an urgent demand of the recipient to take a share in hazard and toil. But since your friendly disposition, kindness, and good will towards me are what they are, I gladly welcome such a spiritâ€”but with one qualification (for I am not going to put aside my feeling of delicacy in making a request): if you carry out your promise, I shall be deeply grateful, and if you do not, I shall understand. I shall take it that you could not bring yourself to deny me (hence the promise), nor yet to deny your fears (hence the withdrawal). To be sure the matter is of great moment. The right course is plain, the expedient doubtful; and yet, if we are the men we ought to be, worthy of our studies and our books, we cannot doubt that whatever is most right is also most advantageous.</p>
