your plans? Not that you stand in any need of such; but the measure and strength of my affection would lend me power to help you with advice.</p>
<p>I shall be writing more later on. In a few days’ time I shall be sending couriers of my own household, since I wish to present in a single letter a full report to the Senate of the entire summer’s operations, which I have conducted with considerable success and to my own satisfaction. As for your Priesthood,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_465_2" id="target_note_LCL205_465_2"><sup>2</sup></a> you will learn from the letter I have given to your freedman Thraso how much attention I have devoted to this delicate and difficult matter.</p>
<p>My dear Curio, I have a solemn plea to make to you in the name of the unbounded kindness you bear me and I no less bear you, not to allow my tenure of this tiresome provincial post to be extended for any additional period. I took this up with you in person when I had no idea that you would be Tribune of the Plebs for the year in question, and have often mentioned it in my letters. But at that time I asked you as a member of the Senate, though to be sure a young man of the highest birth and personal influence; now I ask you as Tribune, and what is more as Tribune Curio. I do not want anything new decreed, which is apt to be difficult, but just the opposite. I want you to defend the Senate’s decree and the laws of the land, and I want the terms on which I came here to stand intact. Allow me once more to make this pressing request of you.</p>
