and wary of plots; I can have no greater source of pleasure, nothing more precious, than your life. Only you must be careful that fearing does not give you further cause for fear; and at the same time you should meet the veterans where you can. First, do what they want about the Commission of Ten. Second, with regard to gratuities, you should propose, if you think fit, that the lands of the veteran soldiers who were with Antony be assigned them by the two of us, and, as regards cash, say that the Senate will take time to decide in the light of the financial situation. It occurs to me that the four legions for whom the Senate has voted grants of land can be provided for out of the ∗ lands and the Campanian land. I think the lands should be assigned to the legions in equal portions, or by lot.</p>
<p>It is not my perspicacity that impels me to write all this, but my affection for you and my desire for public tranquillity, which cannot subsist without you. Unless it is really necessary, I shall not leave Italy. I am arming and equipping my troops. I hope I shall have a not wholly contemptible army to meet all contingencies and attacks. Caesar is not sending me back the legion from Pansa’s army.</p>
<p>Please answer this letter at once, and send one of your own people if there is anything especially confidential which you think I ought to know.</p>
<p>24 May, from Eporedia.</p>
