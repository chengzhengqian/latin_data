<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Camp near Iconium, 3 September (or shortly after) 51</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to M. Cato greetings.</p>
<p>In view of the close relations between us I feel I should write to inform you that a mission from Antiochus of Commagene has arrived in my camp near Iconium on 3 September with the news that the King of Parthiaâ€™s son, who is married to a sister of the King of Armenia, has arrived on the banks of the Euphrates with a massive Parthian army and a large force in addition, drawn from many different nationalities; that he has already begun the passage of the river; and that there is talk of the King of Armenia invading Cappadocia.</p>
<p>I have not written an official dispatch for two reasons. The envoys say that the King of Commagene himself sent messengers and a letter to the Senate immediately; and I expect that Proconsul M. Bibulus, who left by sea from Ephesus for Syria about the Ides of August, has already arrived in his province, since he had favourable winds. I presume that everything will be more reliably reported to the Senate in a dispatch from him. In such a situation, with a war on so large a scale, my own principal preoccupation is to hold by my gentleness and moderation, through the loyalty of our subjects, what I can hardly hold by the troops and resources at my disposal. I hope that, as in the past, I shall have your regard and protection in my absence.</p>
