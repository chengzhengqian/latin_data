of them individually. So you will both do my friend Hispo a good turn at my instance and strengthen my relations with the Company. You yourself will reap a rich reward from Hispoâ€™s attentiveness (he is very appreciative of a service) and from the influence of the Company members, persons of the highest consequence. You will also do me a great kindness. For you may take it that within the whole sphere of your provincial authority you could do nothing that would oblige me more.</p>

<p>I think you know that I was on very familiar terms with T. Pinnius, as he himself has testified in his will, under which I am appointed both guardian and second heir. His son, a remarkably studious, erudite, and modest young man, is owed a large sum by the people of Nicaea, about eight million sesterces, and, so I hear, they are particularly desirous to pay him. Not only the other guardians, who know how much you care for me, but the boy himself is convinced that you will do anything for my sake. You will therefore deeply oblige me if you see to it (so far as your conscience and dignity will allow) that as much of the amount as possible is paid to Pinnius as soon as possible on behalf of the people of Nicaea.</p>
