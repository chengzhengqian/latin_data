who taught me how to win? When I think what a combination of powerful persons you disregarded to save my life, I can hardly doubt your readiness to smash and squash a set of petty backbiters with their spiteful tittle-tattle, when it’s for an honour.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_429_1" id="target_note_LCL216_429_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Well then, if you love me as you usually do, let me put myself wholly in your hands. Look upon this load, such as it is, as yours to shoulder, a task you ought to perform for the sake of my standing. You know that somehow or other my career is apt to find tongues to carp at it—truly no fault of mine, but what difference does that make if the thing happens just the same, fated somehow? If anyone <span class="italic">does</span> show a disposition to stand in my light, may I ask you to defend me in my absence with no less than your usual generosity? I am appending the text of my dispatch to the Senate on my military operations for your perusal.</p>
<p>They tell me that a runaway slave<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_429_2" id="target_note_LCL216_429_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of yours, a reader, is with the Vardaei. You gave me no commission about him, but I have none the less issued instructions in advance that he be searched for by land and sea, and no doubt I shall find him for you, unless he has made off into Dalmatia—though even there I shall winkle him out sooner or later.</p>
<p>Don’t forget me. Good-bye.</p>
<p>11 July, from camp at Narona.</p>
