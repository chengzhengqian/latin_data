<span class="salute">CICERO TO TREBIANUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Tusculum (?), mid June 45 (?</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to Trebianus greetings.</p>
<p>My feelings towards Dolabella used to be merely of regard. I <span class="italic">owed</span> him nothing, for it had never so happened that I had need of his services, and he was indebted to me for standing by him in his ordeals.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_309_1" id="target_note_LCL216_309_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But now, by his superlative response both previously in the matter of your estate and at the present time in that of your restoration, his kindness has placed me under so powerful an obligation that there is no man to whom I am more beholden. On this my hearty congratulationsâ€”and I would rather <span class="italic">you</span> congratulated me than thanked me. Thanks I do not at all crave, and congratulations you can offer in all sincerity.</p>
<p>For the rest, now that your high character and standing have cleared the way for your return to your family and friends, as a wise and high-minded man you must forget what you have lost and think of what you have recovered. You will live with your people and with me. You have gained more in respect than you have lost in possessions. And possessions themselves would be more enjoyable if there were a commonwealth.</p>
<p>Our friend Vestorius has written to me that you express the utmost gratitude to myself. Such acknowledgement on your part is very agreeable to me, and I am particularly willing that you make it among others to our friend Siro. One likes what one does to win approbation, and the approbation of our wisest is especially welcome.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to seeing you as soon as possible.</p>
