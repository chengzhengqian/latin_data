<p class="noindent">From C. Asinius Pollio to Cicero.</p>
<p>My Quaestor Balbus has taken himself off from Gades, and after three days’ hold-up off Calpe due to weather has crossed over into King Bogud’s territory<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_359_1" id="target_note_LCL230_359_1"><sup>1</sup></a> with his pockets very nicely lined—a large sum in cash, a mass of gold, and a bigger mass of silver, all collected from the public revenues—without even giving the troops their pay. With the rumours that are coming in, I don’t yet know whether he will be returning to Gades or going to Rome—he changes his plans on every new report in the most contemptible fashion.</p>
<p>The following exploits, on the model of C. Caesar as he himself boasts, are in addition to his pilferings and robberies and floggings of provincials: At the games which he gave at Gades he presented a gold ring<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_359_2" id="target_note_LCL230_359_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to an actor, one Herennius Gallus, on the last day of the show, and led him to a seat in the fourteen rows (that being the number he had assigned to the Knights).

He brought back exiles, not those of recent years but agitators responsible for the massacre or expulsion of the Senate during Sex. Varus’ Proconsulate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_359_4" id="target_note_LCL230_359_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>For other proceedings he could not even quote Caesar’s precedent. He put on a play at the show about the journey he made to persuade Proconsul L. Lentulus to change sides,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_359_5" id="target_note_LCL230_359_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and what is more, burst into tears during the performance at the poignant memory of his adventures.
