colleague. Of Brutus there is no certain news as yet. As you recommend, I am continually urging him in private letters to join the common fight. I only wish he were here now. I should then be less apprehensive about the internal mischief in Rome, which is no light matter. But what am I doing? I am not copying your laconism—here is the second little page on its way!</p>
<p>Victory and good-bye!</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Cassius greetings.</p>
<p>The brevity of your letters makes me too write more briefly; and, to tell the truth, nothing very much occurs to me to write about. I am sure our news reaches you in the city news, and of yours I know nothing. It is as though Asia were sealed off. Nothing gets through to us except rumours that Dolabella has been crushed—consistent enough, but so far unvouched for.</p>
<p>As for us, just when we thought the war was finished, we have suddenly been plunged into grave anxiety by your connection Lepidus. You must therefore realize that the state’s best hope lies in you and your men. True, we have strong armies, but though all goes well, as I trust it may, it is highly important that you should come. The hope for a free constitution is meagre (I do not like to say nonexistent), but, such as it is, it is bound up with the year of your Consulship.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_379_1" id="target_note_LCL230_379_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
