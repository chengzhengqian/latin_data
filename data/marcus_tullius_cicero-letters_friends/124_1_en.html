<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Brundisium, 4 June, or shortly after, 51</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Appius Pulcher, greetings.</p>
<p>On 4 June I received a letter from you at Brundisium in which you write that you have commissioned L. Clodius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_283_1" id="target_note_LCL205_283_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to discuss certain matters with me. I am eagerly expecting him, so as to learn as soon as possible what word he brings from you. You have, I hope, already had evidence in plenty of my good will and desire to serve you, but I shall demonstrate it most conspicuously where I can most clearly show how precious to me are your good name and dignity. Your warm regard for myself had been made plain to me by Q. Fabius Vergilianus, by C. Flaccus, son of Lucius, and especially by M. Octavius, son of Gnaeus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_283_2" id="target_note_LCL205_283_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I had previously deduced it from many indications, above all the charming gift of your volume on Augury<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_283_3" id="target_note_LCL205_283_3"><sup>3</sup></a> with its affectionate dedication to me.</p>
<p>All that I can do for you to the uttermost limits of friendly service shall be done. My esteem for you has increased from day to day ever since you began to have a regard for me. To that has accrued my associations with connections of yours, for two of whom, belonging to different generations, I have the greatest esteem, namely Cn. Pompeius, your daughter’s father-in-law, and your son-in-law, M. Brutus; further our association in the same College, especially now that you have approved it in so flattering a fashion, has in my eyes added a tie of no small importance to the linking of our sentiments.</p>
<p>Well, when I have met Clodius, I shall write to you
