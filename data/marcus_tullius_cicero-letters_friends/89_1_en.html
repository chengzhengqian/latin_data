it’s both together, I wonder who is going to put up with you except myself, who can put up with anything from you.</p>
<p>But to come back to the point, I am heartily glad that you are tolerably content to be out there. That gives me as much pleasure as the other gave me distress. My only apprehension is that your professional skill may stand you in poor stead, for out there, as I hear,</p>

<p class="noindent">You yourself are used to being called in for ‘a using of force.’ But you don’t have to worry about that limiting clause in the injunction, ‘provided you have not been the first to enter by armed force’—I know you are no ruffling blade to start a quarrel!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_213_2" id="target_note_LCL205_213_2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, to give you a caveat from your own legal arsenal, I advise you to keep clear of the Treviri—I hear they are <span class="italic">capital</span> customers, like their Roman namesakes. If you want a Board of Three, better try the Masters of the Mint!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_213_3" id="target_note_LCL205_213_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But we’ll have our joke some other time. Please write to me in full detail about everything over there.</p>
