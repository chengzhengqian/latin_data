from day to day, in order to inform you when everything was over. I have waited until the Kalends of August. The Praetorian elections have been held up by various accidents. What is going to happen in my own I don’t know. As regards Hirrus, the election of the Plebeian Aediles has produced an amazing current of opinion. M. Coelius Vinicianus was suddenly brought down (with loud shouts to follow as he lay) by that silly statement of his which we laughed at together at the time and the notice of legislation about a Dictator.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_361_3a" id="target_note_LCL205_361_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> After that came a universal hue and cry that <span class="italic">now</span> Hirrus must not be elected.

From this passage it is inferred that Coelius did likewise, and that his rout in the elections to the Plebeian Aedileship was now taken as a bad sign for Hirrus.
