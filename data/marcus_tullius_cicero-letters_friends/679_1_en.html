<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Cornificius.</p>
<p>My friend C. Anicius, a man of quality in every sense of the word, has been appointed to a Free Commissionership to Africa for purposes of private business. I shall be grateful if you will give him every assistance, and do all you can to facilitate the smooth transaction of his affairs. In particular (something he has very much at heart) I would ask you to look after his personal dignity, and to do for him what I myself used to do for all Senators in my province without being asked: I granted them lictors, having received the same privilege myself and knowing it had been commonly done by persons of the highest eminence. So please do this as a friend, my dear Cornificius, and have regard for his prestige and material interests in all other respects. I shall take it very kindly.</p>
<p>Take care of your health.</p>
