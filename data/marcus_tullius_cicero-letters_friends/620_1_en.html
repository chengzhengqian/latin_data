commonwealth, we shall here find an end to the audacity of the desperados and our own anxiety. If, however, the bandit hears that I am on my way and beats a retreat back to Italy, it will be Brutusâ€™ duty to block him. I am sure that Brutus will lack neither skill nor courage. None the less, I shall in that event send my brother with the cavalry in pursuit and for the defence of Italy from devastation.</p>
<p>Take care of your health and remember me kindly, as I do you.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Plancus to Cicero.</p>
<p>I should be ashamed to chop and change in my letters, were it not that these things depend on the fickleness of another person. I did everything in my power to combine with Lepidus for the defence of the commonwealth, so that I could oppose the desperados on terms which would leave you at home less cause for anxiety. I pledged myself to all he asked and made other promises voluntarily. The day before yesterday I wrote to you that I was confident of finding Lepidus amenable and of conducting the war in concert with him. I relied on letters in his handwriting and on the assurance given in person by Laterensis, who was with me at the time, begging me to make up my quarrel with Lepidus and to trust him. It is now no longer possible to augur well of him. But at least I have taken, and shall continue to take, good care that the supreme interests of the commonwealth are not betrayed by my credulity.</p>
