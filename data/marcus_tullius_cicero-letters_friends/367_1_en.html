<p class="noindent">From Cicero to M. Fabius Gallus greetings.</p>
<p>I had just got in from Arpinum when I was handed a letter from you. By the same bearer I received a letter from Avianius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_265_1" id="target_note_LCL216_265_1"><sup>1</sup></a> containing a very handsome offer to debit me after he arrives from any date I please. Now pray put yourself in my shoes. Can you reconcile it with your sense of decency or with mine to ask for credit in the first place, and in the second for more than a year’s credit? But everything would be straightforward, my dear Gallus, if you had bought what I needed and within the price I had wished to pay. Not but what I shall stand by these purchases you say you have made, indeed I am grateful. I fully understand that you acted out of good will, affection indeed, in buying the pieces which pleased you (I have always regarded you as a very fine judge in any matter of taste), and which you considered worthy of me. But I hope Damasippus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_265_2" id="target_note_LCL216_265_2"><sup>2</sup></a> doesn’t change his mind, for, frankly, I don’t need any of these purchases of yours. Not being acquainted with my regular practice, you have taken these four or five pieces at a price
