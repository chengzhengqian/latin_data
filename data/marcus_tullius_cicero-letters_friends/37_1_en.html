thanks to your noble self, I am not overmuch dissatisfied with <span class="italic">my</span> lot, for you saw to it that what I forfeited in worldly prosperity should appear more than made up to my future reputation and memory.</p>
<p>Your services to me and my affection for you alike prompt me to a word of admonition. Use all diligence and effort to win all the glory that has fired your imagination since you were a lad. Never let any man’s injustice bend the greatness of spirit which I have always admired and loved in you. Yours is a great reputation, your liberality is loudly commended, your Consulship has left a fine memory. You cannot fail to see how much all this will gain in definition and brilliance by an access of credit from provincial office and command.

Prepare for that, think of it, train for it. Realize—it is what you have always hoped for, so I do not doubt that you are aware now that you have achieved it—that without any difficulty you can hold the greatest and highest place in our society. I trust you will not think this exhortation on my part a piece of unnecessary verbiage. It was the reason why I felt I should advise you in the light of our common experience to consider whom to trust, and of whom to beware, throughout the rest of your natural life.</p>
