<p class="noindent">From Quintus to his dear Tiro best greetings.</p>
<p>A second packet has reached me with no letter from you, and my thoughts have drubbed you with reproaches, though I say nothing. You cannot hope to escape punishment for this offence if you conduct your own case. You must call Marcus in and see whether he can prove you innocent with a speech long pondered in the watches of many a night. I really do beg of you—I remember how our mother in the old days used to seal up the empty bottles, so that bottles drained on the sly could not be included with the empties—so you likewise write, even though you have nothing to write about, so that you are not suspected of having scraped an excuse to cover your idleness. Your letters always tell me things most true and agreeable.</p>
<p>Love us and good-bye.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Q. Cicero to his dear Tiro best greetings.</p>
<p>By your letter you have given me a fine drubbing for my idleness. My brother wrote more charily, no doubt because he did not like to say too much and was pressed for time. You handle the same material, but give the naked truth
