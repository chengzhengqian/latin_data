have done nothing without due consideration. But in virtue of our old friendship, I would urgently request you to spare his sons, who are in your hands, if only as a favour to me, unless you think your reputation would thereby be in any way compromised. If <span class="italic">I</span> thought that, I should not dream of asking you—your credit would be of much more consequence in my eyes than the connection I have mentioned. But I am persuaded (I may be wrong) that such action will bring you commendation rather than criticism. If it is not troubling you too much, I should be glad to learn from you what can be done, and what you can do for my sake—of your will I have no doubt.</p>

<p>Why should I recommend to you a person for whom you yourself have a regard? However, to let you know that I have not only a regard but an affection for him, I am writing you these lines. Of all your good offices, which are many and great, it will be to me the most agreeable if you will deal with Egnatius so as to make him feel that I am fond of him and that you are fond of me. I beg this of you as a special favour.</p>

Well, let me apply the proverbial comfort—it may all be for the best. But of this when we meet. Be sure to keep your affection for me, and be satisfied of mine for you.</p>
