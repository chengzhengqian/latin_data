province, no one having come to replace him, when Pompey and his army arrived. There was nothing Antistius could do. Given the opportunity, he would have preferred above all things to rejoin Capito, whom he loved as a father, especially as he knew how strongly attached Capito was and has always been to Caesar. But taken as he was by surprise, he touched only such employment as he could not refuse. When money was minted at Apollonia, I cannot assert that he was not in charge, and I cannot deny that he was present, but for no more than two or perhaps three months. After that he kept away from the army and shunned all activity. I hope you will take my word for this as an eyewitness. He saw my despondency in that war, and shared all his thoughts with me. So he hid himself in a corner of Macedonia as far away as possible from the army, so as not to be present at any activity, let alone in command. After the battle he went to Bithynia, to a person with whom he had connections, A. Plautius. There Caesar saw him, and without a word of harshness or reproof told him to return to Rome. Directly afterwards he fell ill, and never recovered. He arrived in Corcyra a sick man, and there died. Under his will, made in Rome in the Consulship of Paullus and Marcellus, he left Capito five-sixths of his estate. The remaining sixth is left to persons whose portion may be confiscated to the state without exciting any complaint. It amounts to HS3,000,000. But this is Caesarâ€™s business.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Plancus, I appeal to you in the name of my friendship with your father and our mutual affection, of our studies and the whole tenor of our lives in which we are so much alike: I beg you with all possible earnestness and urgency to take this matter up and regard it as mine.
