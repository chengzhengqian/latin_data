some providence came to my rescue—I was quickly recognized by our men.</p>
<p>On the Aemilian Way itself, where Caesar’s praetorian cohort was stationed, there was a long struggle. The left wing, which was weaker, consisting of two cohorts of the Martian Legion and one praetorian cohort, began to give ground, because they were being surrounded by cavalry, which is Antony’s strongest arm. When all our ranks had withdrawn, I started to retreat to the camp, the last to do so. Having won the battle, as he considered, Antony thought he could take the camp, but when he arrived he lost a number of men there and achieved nothing.</p>
<p>Having heard what had happened, Hirtius with twenty veteran cohorts met Antony on his way back to his camp and completely destroyed or routed his forces, on the very ground of the previous engagement near Forum Gallorum. Antony withdrew with his horse to his camp at Mutina about 10 o’clock at night. Hirtius then returned to the camp from which Pansa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_251_2" id="target_note_LCL230_251_2"><sup>2</sup></a> had marched out and where he had left two legions, which had been assaulted by Antony. So Antony has lost the greater part of his veteran troops; but this result could not be achieved without some losses in the praetorian cohorts and the Martian Legion. Two eagles and sixty standards of Antony’s have been brought in. It is a victory.</p>
<p>15 April, from camp.</p>
