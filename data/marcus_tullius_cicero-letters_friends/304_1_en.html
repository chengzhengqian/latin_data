<p>I hope you are well, as I am.</p>
<p>I am expecting our couriers any day. When they arrive, perhaps I shall know better what to do, and I shall at once inform you. Take good care of your health.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>Kalends of September.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Tullius to his dear Terentia greetings.</p>
<p>I think I shall get to Tusculum either on the Nones or on the following day. Kindly see that everything there is ready. I may have a number of people with me, and shall probably make a fairly long stay there. If there is no tub in the bathroom, get one put in; likewise whatever else is necessary for health and subsistence.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
<p>Kalends of October, from the district of Venusia.</p>
