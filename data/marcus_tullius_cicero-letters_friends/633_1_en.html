<p class="noindent">From D. Brutus to M. Cicero greetings.</p>
<p>My affection for you and your services to me make me feel on your account what I do not feel on my own: fear. Here is something I have often been told and have not thought negligible—my latest informant is Labeo Segulius (he never acts out of character), who tells me that he has been with Caesar and that a good deal of talk about you took place. Caesar, he says, made no complaints about you to be sure, except for a remark which he attributed to you: ‘the young man must get praises, honours, and—the push.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_307_1" id="target_note_LCL230_307_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He added that he had no intention of letting himself get the push. I believe that the remark was repeated to him (or invented) by Labeo, not produced by the young man. As for the veterans, Labeo would have me believe that they are grumbling viciously, and that you are in danger from them. He says they are particularly indignant that neither Caesar nor I have been put on the Commission of Ten,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_307_2" id="target_note_LCL230_307_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and that everything has been placed in the hands of you gentlemen.</p>
<p>When I heard all this, though I was already on the march, I thought it would be wrong for me to cross the Alps yet, before I knew what was going on in Rome. As for the danger to yourself, believe me, they are hoping to gain larger gratuities by talking at large and threatening trouble. They mean to terrorize you and instigate the young man. This whole rigmarole has one origin: they want to make as much profit for themselves as possible. At the same time I don’t want you to be other than circumspect
