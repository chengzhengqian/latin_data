<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Ligarius.</p>
<p>In your present circumstances I owed it to our friendship to write to you something that might bring comfort or help, but hitherto I have not done so, because I did not see how my words could assuage or alleviate your distress. But now that I have begun to entertain high hopes that we shall soon have you back in your rightful place, I feel I must make clear to you both my opinion and my disposition.</p>
<p>First then, let me say that, in my understanding and perception, Caesar will not be over hard on you for long. Circumstances, time, public opinion, and, I think, his own nature make him more lenient every day. This I feel where others are concerned, and as regards yourself I also hear it from his most intimate friends. Ever since the news<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_323_1" id="target_note_LCL216_323_1"><sup>1</sup></a> arrived from Africa, I have never stopped pleading with them in conjunction with your brothers. Their high character, family feeling, conspicuous affection for you, and assiduous, unflagging concern for your rehabilitation are producing an effect; so much so that I believe there is nothing which Caesar himself will not concede. But if it goes more slowly than we wish, the heavy pressure of business upon him as the recipient of all petitions has made access to him more difficult, and at the same time he was especially irritated by the resistance in Africa, and seems inclined to prolong the anxieties of those who he feels caused himself protracted difficulty and annoyance. But in this too I understand that every day makes him more toler­ant
