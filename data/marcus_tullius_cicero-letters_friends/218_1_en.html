If the Consuls in office were not who they actually are, you, my dear Paullus, would be the man to whom I should be sending to secure their most friendly dispositions towards me. As it is, the highest power and the highest influence are yours, and the relations between us are universal knowledge. Therefore I earnestly beg you to ensure that a decree in the most complimentary terms goes through concerning my successes, and as rapidly as possible. That they are worthy of recognition and congratulation you will find from the dispatch which I have addressed officially to you and your colleague and the Senate. And I hope you will regard yourself as having undertaken to look after all other concerns of mine, my reputation above all. In particular I trust you will take care that my tenure is not extended, as I requested in my previous letter. I want to see you Consul, and while you are in that capacity to attain all my hopes, not only in my absence, but also on the spot.</p>
