<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Acilius, Proconsul,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_47_1" id="target_note_LCL230_47_1"><sup>1</sup></a> greetings.</p>
<p>L. Manlius Sosis was formerly a citizen of Catina, but became a Roman citizen along with the rest of the Neapolitan community and a town councillor at Naples, having been enrolled as a citizen of that municipality before the franchise was granted to the allies and the Latins.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_47_2" id="target_note_LCL230_47_2"><sup>2</sup></a> His brother recently died at Catina. We do not expect any dispute to arise as to his title to the estate, and he is in possession of it at the present time. However, since he also has some old affairs of business in his part of Sicily, I beg to recommend to your notice this matter of his brotherâ€™s estate and all other concerns of his, above all the man himself. He is an excellent person, a familiar friend of mine, conversant with the literary and scholarly pursuits in which I chiefly delight.</p>
<p>Let me then ask you (whether or not he goes to Sicily) to be aware that he is one of my closest and most intimate friends, and to let him understand by the way you treat him that my recommendation has been of substantial assistance to him.</p>
