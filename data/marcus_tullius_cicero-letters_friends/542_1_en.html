But you are perfectly well aware that we cannot be driven into any course, and it may be that your present menacing behaviour is designed to make our deliberate choice look like fear.</p>
<p>To summarize our position, we are desirous to see you an important and respected member of a free commonwealth. We are not fastening any quarrel upon you, At the same time, our freedom means more to us than your friendship. On your part, consider well what you undertake and what you can sustain.

If it should be otherwise, then we pray that they may bring you as little hurt as possible without detriment to the public safety and honour.</p>

I am no longer sorry to have made a break in our correspon­dence,
