You may expect much gratification from the attentions of such distinguished persons. Let me again ask you very particularly to be good enough to act accordingly.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Cornificius greetings.</p>
<p>Sex. Aufidius is most attentive to me—my nearest intimates hardly more so—and there is no more distinguished member of the equestrian order. His personality is a singularly judicious blend of moral strictness and warm kindliness. Let me recommend to you his affairs in Africa in all earnestness and sincerity. I shall be deeply obliged if you make it apparent to him that my letter has carried great weight with you. My dear Cornificius, I ask this as a particular favour.</p>
