resolutions are strengthened when I find that wise and loyal advisers are of the same opinion.</p>
<p>I have a real regard for Appius, as I have often told you, and as soon as we buried our hatchet I perceived the beginning of a corresponding feeling on his side. As Consul he showed me consideration and became a pleasant friend, not without an interest in my literary pursuits. That friendliness on my side was not wanting <span class="italic">you</span> can testify. And now, I suppose, Phanias corroborates, like a witness in a comedy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_415_2" id="target_note_LCL205_415_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And I do assure you that I valued him the more because I saw he had an affection for you. Further, that I am devoted to Pompey you know, and you are aware of my affection for Brutus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_415_3" id="target_note_LCL205_415_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Why on earth should I <span class="italic">not</span> be gratified to welcome the friendship of such a man—in the prime of life, wealthy, successful, able, surrounded by children, by connections of blood and marriage, and by friends—a colleague too, who has put his learned work to the glory of our College in the form of a compliment to me? I have written at some length on this topic because your letter suggested the shadow of a doubt in your mind about my feelings towards him. I suppose you have heard some story. If so, believe me, it is untrue. There is some dissimilarity, generally speaking, between his administration of the province and my own ordinances and principles. Hence perhaps some have suspected that I differ from him out of personal animus, not from theoretical disagreement. But I have never said or done anything with a wish to injure his reputation, and after this recent trouble and our friend Dolabella’s precipitate behaviour, I am ready with my intercession in his hour of danger.</p>
