only your business to do what is asked of you (though that is a great deal in all conscience), but that the whole load is yours to bear, you will succeed. Or do I act like a fool in my present sorry state, or presume too far upon friendship, when I saddle you so? But your habit of conduct offers an excuse for both. You are so indefatigable on your friends’ behalf that they have come not merely to hope for your help as I do, but to demand it as I am doing.</p>
<p>As for the book which my son will give you, let me beg of you not to let it get into circulation, or else to revise it in such a way that it can do me no damage.</p>

<span class="salute">CICERO TO SERVILIUS ISAURICUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, January 45 (?</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to P. Servilius greetings.</p>
<p>Since A. Caecina is a particularly attached client of your family, and since I know how loyal you are to those connected with you and how merciful to the unfortunate, I should not be recommending him to you, were it not that the memory of his father, who was on very close terms with me, and his own adversity affects me as it ought in the case of a person with whom I have the most intimate and comprehensive ties of common pursuits and good offices. May I request you with all urgency—I could ask nothing with more earnestness and concern of mind—to let my letter add a little extra to what you would have done of your own accord, without anybody’s recommendation, for so eminent and worthy a person in distress, hoping that on this account you will assist him all the more actively in any way you can?
