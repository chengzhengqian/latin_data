which letter-writing was invented, is to inform the absent of what it is desirable for them to know, whether in our interest or their own. Letters of this kind I suppose you do not expect from me, since you have your domestic correspondents and messengers to tell you about your affairs, and there is nothing very new to report about mine. That leaves two categories which give me great pleasure; one familiar and jocular, the other serious and grave. Which would be the less fitting for me to use I don’t know. How can I joke with you by letter in these times, when upon my word I don’t think a Roman who can laugh deserves the name? As for something in more serious vein, what is there for Cicero to write seriously about to Curio except public affairs? But on that subject my predicament is that I dare not write what I think and do not care to write what I don’t think.</p>
<p>Well then, having no topic left, I shall resort to my usual conclusion and urge you to strive for highest glory. You have a formidable adversary ready and waiting—public expectation, which is really amazingly high. This you will easily overcome, but in one way only, and that is by determining to work hard at those pursuits<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_237_1" id="target_note_LCL205_237_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which bring the kind of credit you have set your heart on. I should write more in this strain, if I were not sure that you are your own sufficient spur. Even this little I have said, not to kindle your enthusiasm, but to demonstrate my affection.</p>
