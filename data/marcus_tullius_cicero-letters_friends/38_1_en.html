Senate with very few opposing voices all that they did not expect to obtain even through the People without civil disorder. Caesar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_111_6" id="target_note_LCL205_111_6"><sup>6</sup></a> has been voted a grant to pay his troops and ten Legates; and the appointment of a successor under the lex Sempronia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_111_7" id="target_note_LCL205_111_7"><sup>7</sup></a> has been blocked without difficulty. I tell you this rather briefly because the present political situation is little to my liking; but I tell it all the same, so that I can advise you to learn before you meet with any setback a lesson that I myself have learned from experience rather than books (devoted to every class of literature as I have been since childhood): we must not consider our security without regard to honour, nor honour without regard to security.</p>
<p>It is very kind of you to offer me your congratulations on my daughter’s engagement to Crassipes. I hope and pray that this connection will bring us pleasure. Mind you instruct our dear Lentulus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_111_8" id="target_note_LCL205_111_8"><sup>8</sup></a> most promising and excellent young man that he is, in the accomplishments to which you have always applied yourself, but especially in the imitation of his father; he can have no finer education. I have a special regard and affection for him because he is your son and worthy to be yours, and because he is and always has been fond of me.</p>
