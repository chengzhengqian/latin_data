<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Brutus greetings.</p>
<p>L. Titius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_3_1" id="target_note_LCL230_3_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Strabo, one of our most respected and distinguished Roman Knights, is on intimate terms with me, and we can claim from one another all that belongs to the closest of connections. He is owed money in your province by P. Cornelius. Volcacius, as City Praetor, has remitted the matter for adjudication in Gaul.</p>
<p>May I request you particularly (more so than if the case were mine, in so far as one is more respectably concerned about a friend’s money than about one’s own) to see that the affair is settled? Take it up personally and put it through. Try to arrange, so far as seems to you right and fair, that Strabo’s freedman, who has been dispatched for the purpose, settles the business on the most favourable terms and collects the cash. I shall be deeply beholden, and you yourself will find L. Titius well worthy of your friendship. Let me once more earnestly beg of you to attend to this, as you habitually do to any wish of mine within your knowledge.</p>
