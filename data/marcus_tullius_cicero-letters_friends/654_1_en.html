<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to D. Brutus, Imperator, Consul-Elect, greetings.</p>
<p>Take note: I used to be a trifle irritated by the brevity of your letters. Now I look upon myself as a chatterbox, so I shall follow your example. How much you have said in a few words!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_349_1" id="target_note_LCL230_349_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—that you are in good shape and trying to be in better every day, that Lepidus’ sentiments are satisfactory, that we ought to place unlimited confidence in the three armies. Even if I were a timid man, this epistle of yours would have swept all apprehensions out of my mind; but, as you advise, I have taken the bit between my teeth. After all, I placed my entire hopes in you when you were a prisoner, so you can imagine my feelings now. I long to hand over my patrol to you, dear sir, but only if I can do so while remaining true to my own resolution.</p>
<p>You say you will stay in Italy until you hear from me, if the enemy allows. You will not be doing wrong, for there is much afoot in Rome. But if the war can be finished by your advent, let nothing come before that. You have been decreed the funds most immediately available. Servius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_349_2" id="target_note_LCL230_349_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is devoted to you. I am not behind.</p>
<p>6 June.</p>
