<p>Now I have a favour to ask. If you are going to have time on your hands, as I expect you will, won’t you write a tract on something or other and dedicate it to me, as a token of your regard? You may ask what put that into my tolerably sensible head. Well, I have a desire that among the many works that will keep your name alive there should be one which will hand down to posterity the memory of our friendship. I suppose you will want to know what sort of book I have in mind. With your command of the whole range of knowledge you will think out the most appropriate subject quicker than I; but in general terms, let it be something of relevance to me, with a didactic character so as to have a steady circulation.</p>

<p>Really! Is this what you think I asked you to do—to send me pairings of gladiators, court adjournments, Chrestus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_355_1" id="target_note_LCL205_355_1"><sup>1</sup></a> pilfering, all the trivia which nobody would dare tell me when I am in Rome? Let me show you how highly I value your judgement—and right I am, for I have never known a better <span class="italic">politique</span> than you! I do not even particularly want you to tell me day-to-day political developments in matters of major consequence, unless I am affected personally. Others will be writing, I shall have plenty of oral informants, even common report will transmit a good deal. So I do not expect things past or present from <span class="italic">your</span> pen. What I want from so far-sighted a fellow as yourself is the future.
