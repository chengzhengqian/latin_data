<p class="noindent">From Tullius to his dear Terentia greetings.</p>
<p>I hope you are well, as I am.</p>
<p>I should write to you at greater length and more often if I had anything to say. As it is, you see how matters stand. Of my own sorry state Lepta and Trebatius will tell you. Be sure to take care of your health and Tulliaâ€™s.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Brundisium, 4 January 47</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Tullius to his dear Terentia greetings.</p>
<p>I hope you are well, as I am.</p>
<p>In my present circumstances I have no reason to expect anything in the way of a letter from you or to write to you myself. And yet somehow I do expect letters from home and write when I have a bearer.</p>
<p>Volumnia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_129_1" id="target_note_LCL216_129_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ought to have been more ready to oblige you than she was; and what she did do might have been done with more care and circumspection. However, we have more important matters to occupy and vex us. They are overwhelming me, as was the purpose of those who forced me away from my original intention.</p>
<p>Take care of your health. Good-bye.</p>
<p>4 January.</p>
