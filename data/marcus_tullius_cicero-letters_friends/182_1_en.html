<p class="noindent">From Caelius to Cicero greetings.</p>
<p>Doubtless the news will have reached you that Appius has been charged by Dolabella. I must say that the feeling against him is not what I anticipated. Appius has behaved rather sensibly. The moment Dolabella approached the bench,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_399_1" id="target_note_LCL205_399_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he crossed the city boundary and gave up his claim to a Triumph, thereby blunting sharp tongues and looking readier for the fray than his prosecutor had expected. His hopes are now mainly pinned on you. I know you don’t dislike him. How far you want to put him under obligation rests with you. If you had not had a quarrel with him in the past, you would have a freer hand altogether. As it is, if you demand the letter of the law, the standard of abstract justice without compromise, you will have to be careful not to let it look as though the reconciliation on your side was less than candid and sincere. Moreover, you can safely go the other way, if you want to do him any favours, for nobody is going to say that connection and friendship deterred you from your duty.</p>
<p>It comes to my mind that between the preliminary application and the laying of the charge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_399_2" id="target_note_LCL205_399_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Dolabella’s wife left him. I remember the commission you gave me as you were leaving,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_399_3" id="target_note_LCL205_399_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and I don’t suppose you have forgotten what I wrote to you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_399_4" id="target_note_LCL205_399_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Now is not the time to enter into further de­tails.
