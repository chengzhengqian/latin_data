sure the people of Byllis have expressed their readiness to meet Lucceius’ claims at Pompey’s discretion. But we urgently need your good will, influence, and official authority in addition. Let me again request of you that they be forthcoming. I am particularly gratified that Lucceius’ agents are aware, and Lucceius himself has gathered from the letter you sent him, that no man’s word and influence counts for more with you than mine. Allow me to beg you yet again to let him find by experience that this is really so.</p>

<p class="noindent">Cicero to Culleolus greetings.</p>
<p>I want you to feel thoroughly assured that in doing what you have for L. Lucceius you have accommodated one who never forgets a favour. He is very much beholden to you for it, and Pompey expresses his gratitude in the warmest terms whenever we meet, as we often do. I will add what I feel sure will be highly agreeable to you, that I have personally been deeply gratified by your kindness to Lucceius. As for the future, I have no doubt that you will continue in your generosity, your earlier concern for our sakes being now supported by regard for your own consistency. However, let me again entreat you to be so good as to add at the conclusion some enhancing, crowning touches to your original promise and subsequent performance. You have my solemn guarantee that both Lucceius and Pompey will be deeply obliged and that your favour will be excellently placed.</p>
