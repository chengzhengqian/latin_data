After all, I can challenge all comers as an active correspondent. From <span class="italic">you,</span> on the other hand, I have heard only two or three times at most, and very short letters at that. So if you are a hanging judge to me, I shall convict you on the same charge. Unless you want that to happen, you should take a lenient view of my case.</p>
<p>But there’s enough about letters; I don’t doubt I can give you your fill of them, especially if you are going to appreciate my efforts in that direction. I have been sorry that you have been so long away from us, because I have missed your most delectable company; but at the same time I am glad, because in your absence you have attained all your objectives with the greatest <span class="italic">éclat</span> and because in all your affairs Fortune has seconded my prayers. One short admonition, which my transcendent affection for you compels me to offer: your spirit and talents are so eagerly expected that I don’t scruple to beg and adjure you to shape yourself, before you come back to us, into one capable of matching and living up to the expectation you have aroused. No forgetfulness will ever wipe out the memory of your services<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_231_2" id="target_note_LCL205_231_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to me, and so I ask you to remember, whatever further success and honour may come your way, that you would never have attained them, if in the days of your boyhood you had not listened to my sincere and affectionate advice. So your feelings towards me should be such that my now declining years may rest happily upon your affection and your youth.</p>
