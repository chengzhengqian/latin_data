<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Acilius, Proconsul, greetings.</p>
<p>I have old ties of hospitality with Demetrius Megas, and no native of Sicily is on such familiar terms with me. At my request Dolabella obtained the franchise for him from Caesarâ€”I was involved. So now his name is P. Cornelius. And when Caesar, on account of certain mercenary fellows who were selling his favours, gave orders for the removal of the plaque on which the names of grantees of citizenship had been engraved, he told the same Dolabella in my presence that he need not worry about Megas. In his case the favour held good.</p>
<p>I wanted you to know this, so that you should regard him as a Roman citizen, and in all other respects I recommend him as warmly as I have ever recommended anyone. I shall be very much beholden to you if you deal with him so as to let him understand that my recommendation has been a great asset to him.</p>
