too long from watching over the commonwealth. I was sitting in the poop, you see, with the helm in my hands. But now I have scarcely so much as a place in the hold. Do you suppose there will be any the fewer senatorial decrees if I am in Naples? When I am in Rome, up and down the Forum, decrees are drawn up at the residence of your admirer, my very good friend.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_225_3" id="target_note_LCL216_225_3"><sup>3</sup></a> What is more, when it happens to occur to him, I am put down as present at drafting, and I hear of some decree, allegedly passed on my motion, reaching Armenia and Syria before I know that there has been so much as a mention of the matter concerned. You must not think I am joking. Let me tell you that letters have been brought to me before today from monarchs at the other end of the earth, thanking me for my motion to give them the royal title, when I for my part was unaware of their very existence, let alone of their elevation to royalty.</p>
<p>Very well then. Despite the foregoing, as long as our new Prefect of Morals<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_225_4" id="target_note_LCL216_225_4"><sup>4</sup></a> remains in Rome, I shall defer to your advice: But when he is gone, I’ll betake myself to your mushrooms. If I have a house, I shall make the daily maximum under the sumptuary law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_225_5" id="target_note_LCL216_225_5"><sup>5</sup></a> last ten days. But if I don’t find anything to my taste, I’ve decided to make my home with you—I know I could do nothing that would please you more! I am now giving up hope of Sulla’s house,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_225_6" id="target_note_LCL216_225_6"><sup>6</sup></a> as I said in my last letter, but still I have not quite abandoned it. Would you please inspect the place with the builders, as you say? If there is nothing wrong with the walls or roof, I shall find no fault with the rest.</p>
