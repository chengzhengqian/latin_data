<span class="salute">CICERO TO MANIUS CURIUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, February 44</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Curius greetings.</p>
<p>I readily perceive from your letter that you have a great regard for me, and that you are aware of my affection for yourself. It has always been my endeavour that this should be so. Having both achieved this result, we now have only to vie with one another in acts of friendship, a contest in which the victory of either will leave me equally content.</p>
<p>Just as well that you had no need to give my letter to Acilius. I understand from yours that you did not much require Sulpicius’ help,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_453_1" id="target_note_LCL216_453_1"><sup>1</sup></a> because your affairs have contracted to a point at which, as you say, ‘there is neither head nor foot to them’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_453_2" id="target_note_LCL216_453_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—for my part I wish they had <span class="italic">feet,</span> to bring you home at long last. You see how the sources of ancient wit have dried up. Our friend Pomponius can truly say ‘Save that we few keep the ancient Attic glory living still.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_453_3" id="target_note_LCL216_453_3"><sup>3</sup></a> He is your successor, and I am his. Pray then come back, so that the seed of wit at least does not perish along with the commonwealth.</p>
