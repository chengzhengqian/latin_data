<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Cassius greetings.</p>
<p>Lepidus, your relation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_387_1" id="target_note_LCL230_387_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and my friend, was declared a public enemy by unanimous vote of the Senate on 30 June, as also those who defected from the commonwealth along with him. They have, however, been given until the Kalends of September to come to their senses. The Senate is in stout heart to be sure, but principally because they expect succour from you. At the time of writing we have a major war on our hands through Lepidus’ criminality and fickleness.</p>
<p>Satisfactory reports come in every day about Dolabella, but still without known source or authority, just hearsay. Even so, your letter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_387_2" id="target_note_LCL230_387_2"><sup>2</sup></a> dispatched from camp on the Nones of May has produced a universal conviction in the community that he has already been crushed, and that you are on your way to Italy with your army, so that we shall rely upon your advice and prestige, if operations here have by then been satisfactorily concluded, or upon your army, if anything goes awry, as is apt to happen in war. As for that army, I shall give it every subvention I can. The time for that will arrive when it becomes clear to what extent this army will assist the national cause, or has already done so. Hitherto we hear only of enterprises—fine and splendid to be sure,
