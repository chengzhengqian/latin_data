<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Corduba, early June 43</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Pollio to Cicero best greetings.</p>
<p>I trust you are well, as I am and my army.</p>
<p>News of the battles at Mutina reached me later than it should thanks to Lepidus, who held up my couriers for nine days; albeit, it is desirable to hear of so grievous a public calamity as late as may be; that is to say, for those who can do nothing to help or remedy. I only wish you and your colleagues had ordered me back to Italy in the same decree in which you summoned Plancus and Lepidus. Surely the commonwealth would not then have suffered this blow. Some may be rejoicing at the moment, because the leaders and veterans of Caesar’s party appear to have perished, but they must needs be sorry ere long, when they contemplate the desolation of Italy. For the flower of our soldiers, present and to come, has perished, if there is any truth in the reports.</p>
<p>I did not fail to realize how useful I could have been to the commonwealth if I had joined Lepidus. I should have dispelled all his hesitation, especially with Plancus to help me. But when he wrote me letters of the kind you will read, similar no doubt to the speeches which he is said to have delivered at Narbo, I had to stroke him the right way if I wanted to get provisions on my way through his province. I was also afraid that if the decisive battle took place before I had completed my intention, detractors of mine might put the opposite construction on my patriotic purpose, because of my former friendship with Antony—though no closer than Plancus had with him.</p>
