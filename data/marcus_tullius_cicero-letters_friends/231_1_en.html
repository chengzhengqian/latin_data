<p>As to your grumbles about the trials, I am much less concerned. Every defendant may go to the devil for aught I care. Selius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_497_7" id="target_note_LCL205_497_7"><sup>7</sup></a> may wax eloquent enough to prove himself freeborn—it doesn’t worry me. But my property in wit is another matter. Let us protect that for pity’s sake! Get any court order you like. The only rival I fear in this field is yourself, the rest I despise. You think I’m poking fun at you? Very good, I perceive <span class="italic">now</span> that you are a man of sense.</p>
<p>But really, joking apart, your letter struck me as most entertaining and elegant reading. One part though, however amusing (and it was certainly that), did not make me smile. I am anxious for that friend of ours<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_497_8" id="target_note_LCL205_497_8"><sup>8</sup></a> to carry all possible weight in his career as Tribune, both for his own sake (as you know, I am very fond of him) and also, I may add, for the sake of the commonwealth, which, however poor my return, I shall never cease to love.</p>
<p>Well, my dear Volumnius, now that you have made a start and see that I appreciate it, write to me as often as you can about affairs in Rome and the political situation. I enjoy the way your letters talk. Furthermore, do encourage and confirm Dolabella in his sentiments towards me, which I perceive and judge to be those of sincerely affectionate good will. Make him mine entirely—not, to be sure, that anything is lacking. But keenly desirous as I am, I don’t think I am labouring the point unduly.</p>
