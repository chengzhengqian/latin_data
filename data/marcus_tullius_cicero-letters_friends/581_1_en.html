father, always praised and admired. The Tribunes had summoned a meeting on 20 December and put another matter to the House. I then entered upon a comprehensive survey of the whole political situation. I did not mince my words, and, more by will power than by oratorical skill, I recalled the weak and weary Senate to its old, traditional vigour. That day, and my energy, and the course I took, brought to the Roman People the first hope of recovering their freedom. And from that time forward I have used every possible moment, not only in thought but in action, on behalf of the commonwealth.</p>
<p>If I did not suppose you to be receiving all the city affairs and official proceedings, I should recount them myself, although I am immersed in pressing business. But you will learn all that from others—from me, only a few items, and those in brief. We have a courageous Senate, but of the Consulars some are timid and others disloyal. Servius was a great loss. L. Caesar is thoroughly sound, but as Antony’s uncle he does not speak very forcibly in the House. The Consuls are admirable, D. Brutus is splendid, young Caesar admirable—I for one have good hopes of him in the future. This much at any rate you may take as certain; if he had not rapidly enrolled veterans, if two of Antony’s legions had not put themselves under his orders,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_203_4" id="target_note_LCL230_203_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and if Antony had not been confronted with this menace, he would have stopped at no crime or cruelty.</p>
<p>Although I suppose you have heard all this, I wished you to know it better. I shall write further as soon as I have more leisure.</p>
