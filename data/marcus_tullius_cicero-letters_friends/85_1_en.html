ocean and you didn’t care to watch those charioteers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_205_6" id="target_note_LCL205_205_6"><sup>6</sup></a> though in the old days we could never do you out of a blindfold gladiator. But enough of badinage.</p>
<p>How pressingly I have written to Caesar on your behalf, you know; how often, I know. But to tell the truth, I had temporarily given it up, because in dealing with so generous a man and so warm a friend of mine I did not want to risk appearing to lack confidence in his good will. All the same, in my last letter I thought it time for a reminder, and wrote accordingly. Please let me know the result, and inform me at the same time of your whole situation and all your plans. I am anxious to learn of your present doings and future prospects. How long do you think this absence of yours will continue? For I do assure you that the only thing that consoles me and makes our separation easier to bear is the knowledge (if it be so) that you are the gainer thereby. If that is <span class="italic">not</span> the case, we are arrant fools, both of us—I for not hauling you back to Rome, you for not hastening hither. I’ll be bound that a single meeting of ours, serious or jocose, will be worth more than all our Aeduan brethren,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_205_7" id="target_note_LCL205_205_7"><sup>7</sup></a> to say nothing of the enemy. So please inform me on all points as soon as possible.</p>
<p>By comfort or by counsel or by act I’ll help.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_205_8" id="target_note_LCL205_205_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
