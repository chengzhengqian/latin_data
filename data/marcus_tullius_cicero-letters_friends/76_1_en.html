recommend to me, king of Gaul. Or, if you please, make him over to Lepta,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_187_3" id="target_note_LCL205_187_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and send me somebody else on whom to bestow my favours.’ Balbus and I both raised our hands to heaven. It came so pat as to seem no accident, but divine intervention.</p>
<p>I send you Trebatius accordingly. I thought it right to do so of my own accord in the first instance, but at your invitation in the second. In embracing his acquaintance with all your usual graciousness, my dear Caesar, I should wish you to confer upon his single person all the kindnesses which I could induce you to wish to confer upon my friends. As for him, I will answer that you will find him—I won’t use that old-fashioned expression<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_187_4a" id="target_note_LCL205_187_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> of which you rightly made fun when I wrote to you about Milo, I’ll say it in plain Latin, in the language of sensible men: there is no better fellow, no more honest and honourable gentleman alive. Add to which, he is a leading light in Civil Law; his memory is extraordinary, his learning profound.</p>
<p>I do not ask on his behalf for a Tribunate or Prefecture or any other specific favour. It is your good will and generosity I bespeak; though if in addition you have a mind to decorate him with such ambitious trinkets, I say nothing to deter you. In fine, I put him altogether, as the phrase goes, out of my hand into yours—the hand of a great conqueror and a great gentleman,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_187_5" id="target_note_LCL205_187_5"><sup>5</sup></a> if I may become a trifle fulsome, though that’s hardly permissible with you. But you will let it pass, I see you will.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_187_6" id="target_note_LCL205_187_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
