I should consider excessive for all the statuary in creation. You compare these Bacchantes with Metellus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_267_3" id="target_note_LCL216_267_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Muses. Where’s the likeness? To begin with, I should never have reckoned the Muses themselves worth such a sum—and all Nine would have approved my judgement! Still, that would have made a suitable acquisition for a library, and one appropriate to my interests. But where am I going to put Bacchantes? Pretty little things, you may say. I know them well, I’ve seen them often. I should have given you a specific commission about statues which I know, if I had cared for them. My habit is to buy pieces which I can use to decorate a place in my palaestra,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_267_4" id="target_note_LCL216_267_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in imitation of lecture halls.

For the sum you have spent I should really have much preferred to buy a lodge at Tarracina,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_267_6" id="target_note_LCL216_267_6"><sup>6</sup></a> so as not to be continually imposing on hospitality. To be sure, I realize that my freedman is to blame (I had given him quite definite commissions), and Junius too—I think you know him, Avianius’ friend. I am making some new alcoves in the little gallery of my house at Tusculum, and I wanted some pictures for their decoration—indeed, if anything in this way appeals to me, it is painting.
