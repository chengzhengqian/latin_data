<span class="salute">D. BRUTUS TO CICERO</span>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Vercellae, 21 May 43</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From D. Brutus, Imperator, Consul-Elect, to M. Cicero greetings.</p>
<p>Will you be good enough to read beforehand the dispatch I am sending to the Senate and make any alterations you think proper? You will see for yourself that I had no choice but to write it. When I thought I should have the Fourth and Martian Legions with me, as proposed by Drusus and Paullus with the assent of yourself and the rest, I saw less reason for anxiety as to future operations. But now that I am left with a body of very necessitous recruits, I must needs be gravely apprehensive on my own account and that of you all.</p>
<p>The Vicetini show myself and M. Brutus particular attention. May I beg of you not to let any injury come to them in the Senate for the sake of a pack of slaves?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_303_1" id="target_note_LCL230_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> They have an excellent case, and are eminently loyal to the commonwealth; and their opponents are a disorderly, thoroughly untrustworthy set.</p>
<p>21 May, from Vercellae.</p>
