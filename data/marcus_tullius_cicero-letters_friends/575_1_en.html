<span class="salute">CICERO TO D. BRUTUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, late January 43</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to D. Brutus, Imperator, Consul-Elect, greetings.</p>
<p>I have had word from your lady Polla to give the bearer a letter for you if I wished to send something, but at this particular time I have nothing to write. Everything is in suspense while we wait to hear the result of the embassy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_191_1" id="target_note_LCL230_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of which nothing is reported as yet. However, I think I should tell you to begin with that the Senate and People of Rome are much concerned about you, not only for their own safety’s sake but for that of your prestige. The emotion your name inspires is extraordinary. The whole citizen community feels a peculiar affection towards you, hoping and believing that you will now free our country from tyranny as you have already freed her from a tyrant. The levy is proceeding in Rome and all over Italy, if ‘levy’ is the right word to use when the whole population is freely volunteering in a flush of enthusiasm inspired by craving for liberty and disgust of their long servitude. On other matters it is time for us to be expecting a letter from you with news of yourself and our friend Hirtius and my young friend Caesar. I trust it will not be long before they are joined with you in the bond of a common victory.</p>
<p>I have only to add concerning myself something which I hope and prefer you learn from the letters of those near to you, that my support for your public standing is not and never shall be wanting on any occasion.</p>
