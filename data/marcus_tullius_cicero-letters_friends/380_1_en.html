whether your mind is at ease or whether you are anxiously employed on some substantial bit of military business. So when I am assured of finding you in a mood to laugh, I shall write more at length. However, I want you to know that there was much public concern about P. Sulla’s death before it was known for certain. Now they have stopped wondering <span class="italic">how</span> he met his end. What they know is all they want to know. I bear the event philosophically, apart from one misgiving—I’m afraid Caesar’s auctions may go with less of a swing.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Lepta.</p>
<p>As soon as your letter came to hand by your man Seleucus, I at once sent a note to Balbus enquiring what the law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_291_1" id="target_note_LCL216_291_1"><sup>1</sup></a> had to say. He replied that practising auctioneers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_291_2" id="target_note_LCL216_291_2"><sup>2</sup></a> are debarred from membership of a town council, but that the bar does not apply to persons who have practised in the past. So your friends and mine can set their minds at rest. It would have been intolerable, after all, if persons who had once practised as auctioneers were not allowed to sit on their town councils, while currently practising inspectors of entrails<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_291_3" id="target_note_LCL216_291_3"><sup>3</sup></a> were appointed to the Roman Senate.</p>
