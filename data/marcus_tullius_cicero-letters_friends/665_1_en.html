<p>∗ ∗ ∗ had come to hope, thinking Plancus’ four legions no match for their total force and not believing that an army could be brought over from Italy at such speed. But so far the Allobroges and our entire cavalry, which we had sent there in advance, are holding them saucily enough, and we are confident that they can be held more easily when we arrive. All the same, even if by some chance they cross the Isara, we shall take very good care that they do the commonwealth no damage.</p>
<p>We would have you be of good courage and in the highest hopes for the national cause, seeing as you do that we and our armies stand shoulder to shoulder, notably united and ready for anything on your behalf. Even so, you should by no means relax your efforts, and should take care that in military force and all other respects we are as well equipped as possible to join battle in your defence against a criminal combination of enemies, who have suddenly turned the forces which they have for long been assembling under cover of the public interest into a national threat.</p>
