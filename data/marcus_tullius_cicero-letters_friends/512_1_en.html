<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Memmius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_65_1" id="target_note_LCL230_65_1"><sup>1</sup></a> greetings.</p>
<p>C. Avianius Evander, who is residing in your family chapel, is a person with whom I have a good deal to do and I am on very friendly terms with his former master, M. Aemilius. May I therefore particularly request you to accommodate him in the matter of his residence as far as you can without inconveniencing yourself? It is rather sudden for him to move back on the Kalends of July, because he has a number of commissions on hand for various patrons. Modesty forbids me to ask you at much length, but I am sure that if the matter is of no consequence to you, or not much, you will feel as I should feel if you made any request of me. I shall certainly be most grateful.</p>
