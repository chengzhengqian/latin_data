<span class="salute">CICERO TO TREBONIUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, shortly after the foregoing</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to C. Trebonius greetings.</p>
<p>I have entrusted my <span class="italic">Orator,</span> as I have entitled it, to your friend Sabinus. His race gave me the notion that he would make a trustworthy messenger—unless he has taken a leaf out of the candidates’ book, and laid hold of the name in-continent!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_263_1a" id="target_note_LCL216_263_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> But his modest face and his firm, even way of talking seemed to have something of Cures.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_263_2" id="target_note_LCL216_263_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But that’s enough of Sabinus.</p>
<p>My dear Trebonius, when you left Rome you poured some oil on the flame of my affection; and so, to make it easier for me to bear the smart of missing you, salute me with letters in plenty, on the understanding that the same shall be forthcoming on my side. To be sure, you ought to be more assiduous in this office than I for two reasons: firstly, because, whereas in the old days people in Rome used to write to their friends in the provinces about politics, it is now for you to write to me, for the body politic is over there with you; secondly, because I can give you your due by other services while you are away, but I do not see how you can give me mine except by writing letters.</p>
<p>You will be writing me the rest of your news later on, but now I want first of all to know what sort of a journey you are having, where you saw our friend Brutus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_263_3" id="target_note_LCL216_263_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and how long you spent with him. Then, when you are further on

Or had Sabinus merely assumed his <span class="italic">cognomen,</span> like certain candidates for office (possibly an allusion to C. Calvisius Sabinus)? Probably, however, he was a freedman of Trebonius or even a slave.
