vilification of us. And even if they give us what we ask, I think it won’t be long before we are branded as public enemies or placed under interdict.</p>
<p>You may ask what I advise. We must give way to Fortune, leave Italy, go to live in Rhodes or anywhere under the sun. If things go better, we shall return to Rome. If so-so, we shall live in exile. If the worst happens, we shall take any and every means to help ourselves.

It will be time enough for us to join them when we know what their power amounts to. I shall give any undertaking you and Cassius wish on your behalf. Hirtius demands that I do this.</p>

I don’t suppose they will agree—we shall be putting them in a very invidious light. However, I think I ought not to refrain from demanding anything that I consider fair.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_93_5" id="target_note_LCL230_93_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
