worked wonders. To effect this you have only to bring out for the occasion all the manifold generosity that it lies within your good nature and your present power to provide, not only in a practical way but in words and even in looks.

<p>Take care of your health.</p>

<p>P. Cornelius, the bearer of this letter, has been recommended to me by P. Cuspius. Doubtless you have readily gathered from what I have told you how anxious I am, and ought to be, to serve Cuspius. Let me particularly ask you to ensure that as a result of this recommendation he thanks me as warmly, as soon, and as often as circumstances admit.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
