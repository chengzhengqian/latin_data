<p>My request is the same as ever. I want you to accommodate Avianius with regard to his shipments of grain, both as to place and time of disembarcation. In both respects his wishes were met, likewise at my intercession, for the three years during which Pompey presided over the business.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_265_2" id="target_note_LCL205_265_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The long and short of it is that you have the opportunity to oblige me greatly, if you will let Avianius, since he thinks that I am his good friend, know that you are mine. That will oblige me very much indeed.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to P. Caesius greetings.</p>
<p>May I most particularly recommend to you a Roman Knight, a man of quality in every sense of the word, and a very good friend of mine, P. Messienus, and request you in the name of my friendship with yourself and your father to take him under your patronage and protect his interests and reputation? You will attach to yourself an honourable man, worthy to be your friend, and you will greatly oblige me.</p>
