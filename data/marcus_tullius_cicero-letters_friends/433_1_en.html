<p>As I write these lines to you, it looks as though the final issue of this most disastrous of wars is approaching; or it may be that a decisive action has already taken place. But every day I recall how you and I alone in that great army shared each other’s views, and saw, as no one else did, with what an infinity of evil that war was charged. All hope of peace being excluded, even victory was bound to prove a most bitter experience, fraught with destruction to the vanquished and slavery to the victors.
