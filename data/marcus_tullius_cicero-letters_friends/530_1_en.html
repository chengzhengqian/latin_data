<span class="salute">CICERO TO CASSIUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Pompeii, 3 May 44</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Cicero to Cassius greetings.</p>
<p>Believe me, Cassius, I never stop thinking about you and our friend Brutus, that is to say about the whole country, whose only hope lies in you both and in D. Brutus. I myself now feel more optimistic after the splendid performance of my dear Dolabella. The rot in Rome was spreading and getting more virulent every day, so that I for one was alarmed for the city and for public order inside it. But this has been so effectually suppressed that I think we may now reasonably consider ourselves safe for all time to come from that most squalid of threats at any rate.</p>
<p>The tasks that remain are many and serious, but all depends on you three. However, let us solve each problem as it arises.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_101_1" id="target_note_LCL230_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a> As things have gone so far, it appears that we are free of the despot, but not of the despotism. Our king has been killed, but we are upholding the validity of his every regal nod. And not only that, but we sanction measures which he himself would not be taking if he were alive on the pretext that he had them in mind. I see no end to the business. Laws are posted up, exemptions granted, large sums of money assigned, exiles brought home, decrees of the Senate forgedâ€”it seems we are merely rid of the disgust we felt for an abominable individual and of the mortification of slavery, while the state still lies in the chaotic condition into which he flung it.</p>
<p>You and your friends must straighten out the whole tangle. You must not think that you have done enough for your country already. She has indeed had more from you
