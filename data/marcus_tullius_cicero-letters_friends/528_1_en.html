body racked with pain though it was, he had scarcely greeted me before he exclaimed ‘Oh my dear Cicero, congratulations! If I had as much influence with my nephew<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_97_2" id="target_note_LCL230_97_2"><sup>2</sup></a> as you have with Dolabella, we might now be out of our troubles. As for your Dolabella, I congratulate him and thank him. He is the first Consul since yourself who deserves the name.’ Then he went on to speak at large of your action and achievement, which he called as magnificent, distinguished, and publicly salutary as any in history. And this is the sentiment expressed by all.</p>
<p>Now please allow me to accept this counterfeit inheritance, so to speak, of an acclaim which does not belong to me, and admit me to some small partnership in your triumph. Not but what, my dear Dolabella—for I have written the above only in jest—I would sooner transfer to you all the credit for my own achievements, if any such there be, than divert any part of yours. You cannot but know how deep my regard for you has always been; but your recent exploits have kindled in me such enthusiasm that no affection was ever more ardent. Nothing, believe me, is more beautiful, fair, and lovable than manly virtue. As you are aware, I have always loved M. Brutus for his fine intellect, the charm of his manners, and his outstanding uprightness and reliability. Yet the Ides of March added so much to my love for him that I was astonished to find room for increase where I had long believed all was full to overflowing. Who would have thought that the love I bore you admitted of any accession? Yet the accession is such that it seems to me as though I only now feel love where formerly I felt affectionate regard.</p>
