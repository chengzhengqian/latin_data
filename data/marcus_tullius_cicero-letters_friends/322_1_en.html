<p>I would rather have discussed all this with you in person; but since time was dragging on, I thought it desirable to do so by letter, in order to give you something to say if you should happen to fall in with people who speak ill of me. There are those who hold it an offence in me to be alive, even though my destruction would have brought no advantage to the commonwealth. I am well aware that they think the death roll not long enough. Had those upon it listened to me, they would at least be living honourably, however harsh the terms of peace, proved weaker in military strength but not in the justice of their cause.</p>
<p>So here you have a wordier letter, it may be, than you would have wished. I shall believe you think so, unless you send me a longer one in return. I have certain matters I want to clear up; that done, I hope I shall see you shortly.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to a letter from you on many topics, but to you in person even more. Make Demetrius my friend, and do any other good work you can. I won’t urge you about Aufidius’ debt, for I know you have it in mind. But get a settlement. If you are taking time on that account, I accept your excuse; but if that is not detaining you, hurry. I am impatiently looking forward to a letter from you.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
