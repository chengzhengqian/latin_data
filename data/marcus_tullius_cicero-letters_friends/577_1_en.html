<span class="salute">CICERO TO PAPIRIUS PAETUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, January (?) 43</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Cicero to Paetus greetings.</p>
<p>I should assist your friend Rufus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_195_1" id="target_note_LCL230_195_1"><sup>1</sup></a> about whom you now write to me for the second time, to the best of my ability, even if he had done me an injury, seeing how concerned you are on his behalf. But understanding and concluding as I do both from your letters and from one he has sent me himself that he has been greatly exercised about my safety, I cannot but be his friend, not only because of your recommendation (which carries the greatest weight with me, as is right and proper) but from my personal inclination and judgement. For I want you to know, my dear Paetus, that my suspicions and diligent precautions all started with your letter, which was followed by letters to like effect from many other correspondents. Plots were laid against me both at Aquinum and at Fabrateria of which something evidently came to your ears. They<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_195_2a" id="target_note_LCL230_195_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> put all their energies into catching me unawares, as though they had a presentiment of what a thorn in their flesh I was to become. Unsuspecting as I was, I might have laid myself open but for your admonition. Therefore this friend of yours needs no recommendation to me. I only hope the Fortune of the commonwealth may be such as to enable him to discover that gratitude is a strong point with me. So much for that.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that you have given up dining out. You have deprived yourself of a great deal of amusement
