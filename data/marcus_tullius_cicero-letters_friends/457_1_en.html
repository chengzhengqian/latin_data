<span class="salute">CICERO TO DOLABELLA</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">A villa, December 45 (?</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Dolabella.</p>
<p>I congratulate our Baiae if, as you say, it has suddenly become a healthy spot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_445_1" id="target_note_LCL216_445_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But perhaps it is out of fondness and flattery towards yourself; perhaps the place has forgotten its nature so long as you are there. If that is the explanation, I am not in the least surprised that even air and soil put aside their natural properties for your benefit.</p>
<p>Contrary to what I thought, I find I have with me the little speech in defence of Deiotarus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_445_2" id="target_note_LCL216_445_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which you were asking for, and so I am sending it to you. Please bear in mind, when you read it, that the case was a meagre, paltry affair, hardly worth writing up. But I wanted to send my old friend and host a little present—on the light, coarse-spun side, as his own presents are apt to be.</p>
<p>I wish you good sense and courage, so that your moderation and responsibility will bring shame on the misconduct of others.</p>
