<span class="salute">CICERO TO SERVIUS SULPICIUS RUFUS</span>
</section>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, 46 or 45</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From Cicero to Servius Sulpicius greetings.</p>
<p>There are many good reasons for the regard I have for Manius Curius, who is in business in Patrae. My friendship with him is of very long standing, begun when I first entered public life; and at Patrae his whole house was open to me in this recent terrible war, as well as on several earlier occasions. Had I needed, I should have used it like my own. But my principal link with Curius has, if I may so put it, a more sacred character; for he is a great intimate of our friend Atticus, whom he cultivates and regards more than anybody in the world.</p>
<p>If you happen to have made Curiusâ€™ acquaintance already, I imagine that this letter comes too late; for he is so agreeable and attentive that I expect he will have recommended himself to you by now. If that is so, I would none the less earnestly request of you that any measure of good will you have bestowed upon him prior to this letter of mine may be supplemented as largely as possible by my recommendation. If, on the other hand, his modesty has deterred him from putting himself in your way, or if you do not yet know him sufficiently, or if for some particular reason he requires a recommendation out of the common, then there is no man whom I could recommend to you
