<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Rome, ca. end of 46</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero to Cn. Plancius greetings.</p>
<p>I have received two letters from you, dispatched at Corcyra. In one you felicitate me on hearing that I maintain my former standing. In the other you wish me good fortune and prosperity in the step I have taken.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_373_1" id="target_note_LCL216_373_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

If such force brought victory to those with whom I had associated myself, not desiring war but hoping for peace, I saw none the less the cruelty with which angry, greedy, and unbridled men would exploit it. On the other hand, I realized what their defeat would cost in the lives of our countrymen, some of the highest and some of the best too, men
