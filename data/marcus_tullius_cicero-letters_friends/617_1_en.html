animals; I did not know of Hirtius’ death, but I did know of Aquila’s; I did not trust Caesar until I had met and talked to him. So the first day passed. Early on the next I had a message from Pansa summoning me to Bononia. As I was on my way I received the report of his death. I hastened back to my own apology for an army, as I can truly call it; it is most sadly reduced, and in very bad shape through lack of all things needful. Antony got two days’ start of me and made far longer marches as the pursued than I as the pursuer, for he went helter-skelter, while I moved in regular order. Wherever he went he opened up slave barracks and carried off the men, stopping nowhere until he reached Vada. I want you to know this place. It lies between the Apennines and the Alps, and its approach offers the greatest difficulties.</p>
<p>When I was thirty miles away from Antony and Ventidius had already joined up with him, a speech of his was brought to me in which he now asked his troops to follow him across the Alps and told them that he had an understanding with Lepidus. There was a shout (coming in volume from Ventidius’ men, for Antony has precious few of his own) of ‘death or victory in Italy,’ and they started begging him to let them march on Pollentia. Unable to hold out against them, he fixed his march for the following day.</p>
<p>On receiving this report I immediately sent five cohorts in advance to Pollentia, and myself set out for the town. My detachment arrived there an hour ahead of Trebellius and a squadron of horse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL230_275_1" id="target_note_LCL230_275_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I felt no small satisfaction, for I think victory depends upon ∗ ∗ ∗.</p>
