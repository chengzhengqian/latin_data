<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Side, 3 or 4 August 50</span></p>
<p class="noindent">From M. Cicero, Imperator, to M. Caelius, Curule Aedile, greetings.</p>
<p>Your negotiation with Curio on the matter of the Supplication was a model of thoughtfulness and discretion. The result is indeed to my satisfaction. I am pleased that the thing has been settled so quickly, and also that your and my angry rival<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_423_1" id="target_note_LCL205_423_1"><sup>1</sup></a> gave his assent to the fervid encomiast of my official record.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_423_2" id="target_note_LCL205_423_2"><sup>2</sup></a> You may take it therefore that I am hoping for the sequel.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_423_3" id="target_note_LCL205_423_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Be ready to play your part.</p>
<p>I am glad you speak so well of Dolabella, glad too that you are fond of him. As for the features which you hope may be toned down by my dear Tulliaâ€™s good sense, I know which of your letters<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_423_4" id="target_note_LCL205_423_4"><sup>4</sup></a> to turn up. For that matter you ought to read the letter I sent to Appius at the time on receipt of yours! But what is one to do? Such is life. The Gods bless what is done! I hope to find him an agreeable son-in-law, and there your kindly tact will help us much.</p>
<p>The political situation is very much on my mind. I wish Curio well, I want to see Caesar respected, I can lay down my life for Pompey; but nothing is closer to my heart than the commonwealth itself. You do not make very much of your own political role. I fancy you find yourself torn between loyalties, as a good citizen and as a good friend.</p>
<p>On vacating the province I left my Quaestor Coelius in charge. A boy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_423_5" id="target_note_LCL205_423_5"><sup>5</sup></a> you may say! Well, but he is Quaestor, he is a young man of noble family, and I am following an almost universal precedent. Nor had I anyone available for the appointment who had held a higher office. Pomptinus
