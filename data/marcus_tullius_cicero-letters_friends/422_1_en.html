who, when I declared these views and advised in their own best interests, preferred to have me considered unduly timid than reasonably far-sighted.</p>
<p>As for your felicitations on the step I have taken, I am sure your good wishes are sincere. But I should not have taken any new decision at so sad a time, if on my return I had not found my household affairs in as sorry a state as the country’s. In my own house I knew no security, had no refuge from intrigue, because of the villainy of those to whom my welfare and estate should have been most precious in view of the signal kindnesses I had showered upon them. Therefore I thought it advisable to fortify myself by the loyalty of new connections against the treachery of old ones.</p>
<p>But there’s enough or perhaps too much about <span class="italic">my</span> affairs. As for yours, I would have you think as you should, that is, you must not suppose that you have anything specially to fear. If there is to be a settlement of the community, of whatever nature, you will clearly be free of all hazards. One party is now appeased, as I gather, and the other you have never offended. As for my own disposition towards you, I should like you to feel assured of my support for your estate, reputation, and civil rights in all matters where it seems required. I am well aware of my present position and capabilities, but I can promise my service and advice, and certainly my zeal. I hope you will keep me informed as fully as possible of your activities and plans.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>
