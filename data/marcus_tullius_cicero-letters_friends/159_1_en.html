me to amuse my leisure. When you were in Rome and I had any free time, I was sure of employment the most agreeable in the world—to pass it in your company. I miss that not a little. It is not merely that I feel lonely; Rome seems turned to desert now that you are gone. I am a careless dog, and when you were here I often used to let day after day go by without coming near you. Now it’s a misery not to have you to run to all the time.</p>
<p>Above all else my fellow candidate Hirrus sees to it that I miss you day and night. Just imagine his chagrin—this competitor of yours, this would-be Augur—at finding my prospects of election better than his own, imagine his efforts to pretend it’s otherwise! Upon my word, it’s for your sake rather than my own that I want you to get the news you are praying for concerning him as soon as may be. As for <span class="italic">my</span> sake, if I do get elected, it might suit my book to be in company with the richer of the pair.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_353_1" id="target_note_LCL205_353_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But <span class="italic">this</span> would be too delicious! If it happens, we shall never be short of a laugh for the rest of our days. Yes, it’s worth a sacrifice. But it is a fact that the mislikes which a good many people feel for Hirrus keep him down without notably buoying M. Octavius up.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_353_2a" id="target_note_LCL205_353_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>With regard to the freedman Philotimus’ duty and Milo’s property,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_353_3" id="target_note_LCL205_353_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I have been at pains to ensure that Philotimus behaves with complete propriety to the satisfaction of the absent Milo and of those close to him, and that with good faith and care on his part no harm comes to your reputation.</p>
