to my help at this anxious time, and to dedicate your efforts to a cause in which my credit, indeed I might more properly say my virtual existence, is involved. As for T. Annius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_245_3" id="target_note_LCL205_245_3"><sup>3</sup></a> himself, I promise you that if you will take him to your heart you will have no bolder, steadier, more resolute, or more sincere friend. As for me, you will add lustre and prestige to my name; and I shall readily recognize the same concern for my credit as you once showed for my existence as a citizen.</p>
<p>I should continue further, if I did not know how well you see my mind as I write this letter, that you realize what a load of obligation I carry and how in this candidature of Milo’s I must needs labour and strive, and even fight my hardest. Knowing that, I put the whole matter in your hands; Milo’s cause and I myself are all yours to do with as you will. Only understand that, if you do as I ask, I shall owe you more almost than I owe Milo himself; for my restoration, in which he was my chief helper, meant less to me than the satisfaction I shall take in repaying a sacred debt of gratitude. That I am sure your single support will enable me to attain.</p>
