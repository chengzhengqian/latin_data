consider what you are to do—whether you should stay in Rome or with me or in some place of safety. The decision is yours as well as mine.</p>
<p>The points that occur to me are these: Thanks to Dolabella<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_79_1" id="target_note_LCL216_79_1"><sup>1</sup></a> you can stay in Rome safely, and your doing so might help us if there is any outbreak of violence or looting. But on the other hand I am concerned when I observe that all honest men have left Rome and have their womenfolk with them. Moreover, this district where I am is full of towns friendly to me and also of properties of mine, so that you could be with me a good deal, and when we are separated could live comfortably in places of our own. Frankly I have not yet made up my mind which is the better course. You must observe what other ladies of your rank are doing, and take care that when and if you do want to leave you don’t find the way barred. Do please consider the matter again together and with our friends. Tell Philotimus to see that the house is barricaded and guarded and please arrange reliable couriers, so that I get some sort of a letter from you every day. But your chief care must be for your health, if you want us<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_79_2" id="target_note_LCL216_79_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to keep ours.</p>
