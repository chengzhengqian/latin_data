<p>I wrote to you a few days ago at some length about the political situation and about what is afoot here and my thoughts thereupon. I gave the letter to your boys.</p>
<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p class="noindent">From Cicero to C. Munatius, son of Gaius, greetings.</p>
<p>L. Livincius Trypho is to be sure a freedman of my close friend L. Regulus, whose misfortune<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_255_2" id="target_note_LCL205_255_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has made me even more anxious to serve himâ€”<span class="italic">feel</span> more kindly than I always did I cannot. But I am fond of his freedman for his own sake. He rendered me great service at that crisis of my life in which it was easiest for me to discern the good will and loyalty of my fellows.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL205_255_3" id="target_note_LCL205_255_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I recommend him to you as men who gratefully remember what is done for them ought to recommend their benefactors. You will oblige me greatly if Trypho finds that, when he exposed himself to many dangers in the cause of my restoration (frequently taking ship in the depth of winter), he earned <span class="italic">your</span> gratitude as well as mine in virtue of your kindly disposition towards me.</p>
