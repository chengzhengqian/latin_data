greatly if you will do certain things which he has asked me to raise with you. First, will you please hold over the matter of Pausanias of Alabanda until Nero arrives—I know he is very anxious to help him and so I beg this favour of you earnestly. Next, will you kindly regard the people of Nysa as specially recommended to your favour? Nero has the closest ties with them and is most active in championing their interests. So please let the commune understand that in Nero’s patronage they have a most powerful protection. I have often recommended Strabo Servilius to you, and do so now the more emphatically because Nero has taken up his case. All we ask is that you handle the matter, lest otherwise you leave an innocent man to the rapacity of a successor who may not be like yourself. That will oblige me, and I shall feel that your good nature has had its way.</p>
<p>The sum and substance of this letter is to ask you to continue to confer all possible favours upon Nero, as you have made it your practice to do already. Your province, unlike mine, offers a wide scope to a talented and disinterested young nobleman to recommend himself and advance his reputation. With your backing, which I am sure will be and has already been forthcoming, he will be able to confirm the loyalty of the distinguished body of clients inherited from his ancestors and attach them by favours personal to himself. If you help him in this respect as actively as you have promised, your kindness will be excellently placed with Nero; but I too shall be very greatly beholden.</p>
