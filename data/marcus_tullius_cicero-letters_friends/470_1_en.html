<p>I ought not to promise what you will have to judge for yourself when you come to know him well. Still, in all new associations something depends on the nature of the first approach, the sort of recommendation which opens as it were the door of friendship. That was my purpose in this letter. It should have been achieved, to be sure, by the official bond automatically; all the same, that bond will be none the frailer for this extra link. So if you think as much of me as Varro believes and I myself am conscious that you do, I trust you will make it your business to show me as soon as possible that this recommendation of mine has proved as advantageous to him as he expects (and I do not doubt) it will.</p>

<p>I have always noticed the particular care you take to inform yourself of all that concerns me, so I do not doubt that you not only know which township I hail from but also know how attentively I look after the interests of my fellow townsmen of Arpinum. All their corporate income, including the means out of which they keep up religious worship and maintain their temples and public places in repair, consists in rents from property in Gaul.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL216_471_1" id="target_note_LCL216_471_1"><sup>1</sup></a> We have dispatched the following gentlemen, Roman Knights, as our representatives to inspect the properties, collect sums due from the tenants, and take general cognizance and charge: Q. Fufidius, son of Quintus; M. Faucius, son of Marcus; Q. Mamercius, son of Quintus.</p>
