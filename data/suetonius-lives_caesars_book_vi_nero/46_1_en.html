that was. When he learned that the criminal was stripped, fastened by the neck in a fork<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_172_170" id="target_note_LCL038_172_170"><sup>170</sup></a> and then beaten to death with rods, in mortal terror he seized two daggers which he had brought with him, and then, after trying the point of each, put them up again, pleading that the fated hour had not yet come. Now he would beg Sporus to begin to lament and wail, and now entreat someone to help him take his life by setting him the example; anon he reproached himself for his cowardice in such words as these: “To live is a scandal and shame—this does not become Nero, does not become him—one should be resolute at such times—come, rouse thyself!” And now the horsemen were at hand who had orders to take him off alive. When he heard them, he quavered:</p>

First and beyond all else he had forced from his companions a promise to let no one have his head, but to contrive in some way that he be buried unmutilated. And this was granted by Icelus, Galba’s freedman,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_172_173" id="target_note_LCL038_172_173"><sup>173</sup></a> who had shortly before been released from the bondage to which he was consigned at the beginning of the revolt.</p>
