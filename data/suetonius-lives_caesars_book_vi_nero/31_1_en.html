<p>XXXV. Besides Octavia he later took two wives, Poppaea Sabina, daughter of an ex-quaestor and previously married to a Roman knight, and then Statilia Messalina, daughter of the great-granddaughter of Taurus, who had been twice consul and awarded a triumph. To possess the latter he slew her husband Atticus Vestinus while he held the office of consul. He soon grew tired of living with Octavia, and when his friends took him to task, replied that “she ought to be content with the insignia of wifehood.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_142_123" id="target_note_LCL038_142_123"><sup>123</sup></a> Presently after several vain attempts to strangle her, he divorced her on the ground of barrenness, and when the people took it ill and openly reproached him, he banished her besides; and finally he had her put to death on a charge of adultery that was so shameless and unfounded that, when all who were put to the torture maintained her innocence, he bribed his former preceptor Anicetus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_143_124" id="target_note_LCL038_143_124"><sup>124</sup></a> to make a pretended confession that he had raped her by a stratagem. He dearly loved Poppaea, whom he married twelve days after his divorce from Octavia, yet he caused her death too by kicking her when she was pregnant and ill, because she had scolded him for coming home late from the races. By her he had a daughter, Claudia Augusta, but lost her when she was still an infant.</p>
<p>Indeed there is no kind of relationship that he did not violate in his career of crime. He put to death Antonia, daughter of Claudius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL038_143_125" id="target_note_LCL038_143_125"><sup>125</sup></a> for refusing to marry him after Poppaea’s death, charging her with an attempt at revolution;</p>
