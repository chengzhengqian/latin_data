As for Herdonea, in view of his information that it would have revolted to the Romans and would not remain loyal to him if he should withdraw, he removed the whole population to Metapontum and Thurii and set fire to the city. He put to death the leading men who, he was informed, had had secret conversations with Fulvius. The Romans who had made their escape from so disastrous a battle, by different roads and half-armed sought refuge with the consul Marcellus in Samnium.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_207_1a" id="target_note_LCL367_207_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>II. Marcellus, who was not particularly alarmed by so serious a defeat, wrote a letter to the senate at Rome in regard to the loss of general and army at Herdonea. He said that nevertheless, being the same man who, after the battle of Cannae, had frustrated Hannibal, elated by that victory, he was marching against him to cut short his joy and exultation. At Rome, to be sure, there was not only great sorrow owing to what had happened, but also great fear for the future. The consul, however, crossing over from Samnium into Lucania, pitched camp near Numistro,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_207_2" id="target_note_LCL367_207_2"><sup>2</sup></a> on level ground in sight of Hannibal, while the Carthaginian held a hill. He added the further appearance of confidence in being the first to lead out into battle-line. And Hannibal did not refuse, when he saw the standards borne out of the gates. Nevertheless they drew up their lines so that the Carthaginian made his right wing reach up the hill, while the Romans rested their left wing on the town.
