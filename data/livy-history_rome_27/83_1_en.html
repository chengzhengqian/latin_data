would come over into Italy that summer; but when he recalled what he had himself endured during five months, in crossing first the Rhone, and then the Alps, in conflicts with men and the nature of the country, he looked forward to a crossing by no means so easy and so soon accomplished. This accounted for his slowness in leaving winter quarters. But for Hasdrubal everything moved more quickly and more easily than had been expected by himself and others.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_367_1" id="target_note_LCL367_367_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For not only did the Arverni,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_367_2" id="target_note_LCL367_367_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and then in turn other Gallic and Alpine tribes, receive him, but they even followed him to war.

For previously, being never seen by strange peoples and unaccustomed themselves to see a stranger in their own land, they were unfriendly to the human race in general. And at first, not knowing whither the Carthaginian was bound, they had believed that their own rocks and fastnesses and booty in cattle and men were the objects of attack.
