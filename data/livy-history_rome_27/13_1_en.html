Tubulus, Gaius Aurunculeius. The magistrates <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 210</span>
having been elected for the year, Quintus Fulvius abdicated his dictatorship.</p>
<p>At the end of this summer a Carthaginian fleet of forty ships under command of the prefect Hamilcar crossed over to Sardinia and first laid waste the region of Olbia. Then after Publius Manlius Volso, the praetor, showed himself there with an army, the fleet coasted around from Olbia to the other side of the island, ravaged the territory of Carales<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_227_1" id="target_note_LCL367_227_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and returned with booty of every kind to Africa.</p>
