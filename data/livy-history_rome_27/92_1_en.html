a Carthaginian camp had been pitched before the <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 207</span>
Roman walls and gates. Nor was it quite clear to menâ€™s minds whether they should praise or blame so bold a march on the part of the consul. It was plain that it would be praised or blamed according to the outcome, than which nothing is more unjust. They said that the camp had been left near an enemy who was Hannibal, without a general, with an army from which had been detached all its strength, all its flower. And the consul had indicated a march into Lucania, whereas he was heading for Picenum and Gaul, leaving a camp that was defended by nothing more than the deception of the enemy, who was unaware that the general and a part of his army were not there. What was to happen, if that became known and Hannibal should wish either with his whole army to pursue Nero, who had set out with only six thousand armed men, or else to attack the camp, abandoned to plunder, without proper forces, without its high command, without the auspices?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_385_1" id="target_note_LCL367_385_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The earlier disasters in that war, the death of two consuls in the preceding year, were still terrifying.

For Hasdrubal also was a son of the same father, Hamilcar, and an equally strenuous commander, trained for so many years in Spain by a war with Romans, famous too for a double victory, the destruction of two armies and generals of great distinction. Certainly of the swiftness of his march from Spain, and of having aroused the Gallic tribes to war he could boast far more than Hannibal himself.
