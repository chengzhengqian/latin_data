kind—came the news from Macedonia that one <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 208</span>
Aëropus by bribing the commander of the citadel and garrison had captured Lychnidus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_343_1" id="target_note_LCL367_343_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was holding some villages of the Dassaretii and also stirring up the Dardani. Consequently the king, dropping the Achaean and Aetolian war, but still leaving twenty-five
hundred armed men of every sort with Menippus and Polyphantas as commanders to defend his allies, setting out from Dymae, made his way through Achaia and Boeotia and Euboea in ten day’s marches to Demetrias<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_343_2" id="target_note_LCL367_343_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in Thessaly.</p>
<p>XXXIII. There other messengers met him, bringing news of a greater inroad: that the Dardanians pouring into Macedonia were already holding Orestis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_343_3" id="target_note_LCL367_343_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and had come down into the Argestaean Plain; and that it was currently reported among the barbarians that Philip had been slain. On that raid in which he fought near Sicyon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_343_4" id="target_note_LCL367_343_4"><sup>4</sup></a> with men who were ravaging the country, he was dashed against a tree by his charging horse, and broke off one of the two horns of his helmet against a projecting branch. It was found by a certain Aetolian and carried into Aetolia to Scerdilaedus, who was acquainted with the ornament of the helmet, and this spread abroad the report that the king had been slain. After the departure of the king from Achaia, Sulpicius went with his fleet to Aegina<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_343_5" id="target_note_LCL367_343_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and joined Attalus. The Achaeans fought a successful engagement with the Aetolians and Eleans not far from Messene. King Attalus and Publius Sulpicius spent the winter at Aegina.</p>
