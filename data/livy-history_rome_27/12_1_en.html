they said, if the dictator admitted his own <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 210</span>
name, they would veto the election; if other men than himself were considered, they would not delay the election. The dictator defended the procedure in the election by the authority of the senate, by the decree of the commons, by precedents. For, he said, in the consulship of Gnaeus Servilius, when Gaius Flaminius, the other consul, had fallen at Trasumennus,
by authority of the fathers it was proposed to the commons, and the commons had ordained that, so long as the war remained in Italy, the people should have the right to re-elect as consuls the men they pleased and as often as they pleased from the number of those who had been consuls.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_225_1" id="target_note_LCL367_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He added that he had precedents for so doing: an old instance, that of Lucius Postumius Megellus, who as <span class="italic">interrex</span> had been elected consul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_225_2" id="target_note_LCL367_225_2"><sup>2</sup></a> with Gaius Iunius Bubulcus at an election which he had himself conducted; and a recent case, that of Quintus Fabius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_225_3" id="target_note_LCL367_225_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who surely would never have permitted his consulship to be prolonged unless it were done for the public welfare. After a contest long continued by such speeches, final agreement between the dictator and the tribunes was reached: that they would stand by whatever the senate should decide. To the fathers it seemed a time for the state to have its affairs in the hands of generals mature and experienced and skilled in war; and so they said they did not favour any delaying of the election. Since the tribunes gave way, the election was held. Quintus Fabius Maximus was declared consul for the fifth time, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus for the fourth. Then as praetors the following were elected: Lucius Veturius Philo, Titus Quinctius Crispinus, Gaius Hostilius
