Everywhere Bruttians also were slain, many of them, either by mistake or out of old, inbred hatred of them, or to blot out the report of treachery, that Tarentum might be thought to have been captured rather by force of arms. Then from the slaughter they dispersed to plunder the city. Thirty thousand slaves are said to have been captured, an immense quantity of silver, wrought and coined, of gold three thousand and eighty pounds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_275_2" id="target_note_LCL367_275_2"><sup>2</sup></a> statues and paintings, so that they almost rivalled the adornments of Syracuse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_275_3" id="target_note_LCL367_275_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But Fabius showed more magnanimity in refraining from plunder of that kind than did Marcellus.
