<p>Never in a single battle of that war were so many of the enemy slain, and a disaster equal to that of Cannae, whether in the loss of the general or that of an army, seemed to have been inflicted in return. Fifty-six thousand<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_405_2" id="target_note_LCL367_405_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of the enemy were slain, fifty-four hundred captured. Great was the rest of the booty, both of every kind and of gold and silver as well. In addition, Roman citizens—over four thousand of them—who as captives were in the hands of the enemy were recovered. This was some compensation for the soldiers lost in the battle. For the victory was by no means bloodless. About eight thousand Romans and allies were slain, and to such an extent were even the victors sated with bloodshed and slaughter that on the next day, when word was brought to Livius, the consul, that the Cisalpine Gauls and Ligurians, who either had not been present in the battle, or had escaped in the midst of the carnage, were moving away in one column, with no trustworthy guide, no standards, no formation or high command, that they all could be wiped out, if a single regiment of cavalry should be sent, the consul said, “No! let there be some survivors, to carry the news both of the enemy’s disaster and of our valour.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_405_3" id="target_note_LCL367_405_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
