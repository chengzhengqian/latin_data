Titus Quinctius was to be in charge of Capua and the <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 209</span>
army which Quintus Fulvius had held. Gaius Hostilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_233_1" id="target_note_LCL367_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
was to take over from Gaius Laetorius, the propraetor, his province and the army which was then at Ariminum. To Marcus Marcellus were assigned the legions with which he had carried on operations as consul. To Marcus Valerius and Lucius Cincius—for
their command in Sicily was also prolonged—was
assigned the army from Cannae, and they were ordered to recruit it from the soldiers who survived from the legions of Gnaeus Fulvius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_233_2" id="target_note_LCL367_233_2"><sup>2</sup></a> These were sought out and sent by the consuls into Sicily. And there was added the same humiliation in the service as that under which the men from Cannae were serving, and those from the army of the praetor Gnaeus Fulvius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_233_3" id="target_note_LCL367_233_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who had been sent thither by the senate out of anger on account of their similar flight. To Gaius Aurunculeius in Sardinia were assigned the same legions with which Publius Manlius Volso had held that province.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_233_4" id="target_note_LCL367_233_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Publius Sulpicius was ordered to hold Macedonia with the same legion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_233_5" id="target_note_LCL367_233_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and the same fleet, and his command was prolonged for one year. Thirty quinqueremes were ordered to be sent from Sicily to Quintus Fabius, the consul, at Tarentum.
With the rest of his fleet it was the will of the senate, he was informed, that Marcus Valerius Laevinus should either cross over into Africa himself to plunder the country, or should send at his discretion Lucius Cincius or Marcus Valerius
