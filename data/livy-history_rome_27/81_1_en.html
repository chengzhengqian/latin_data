Accordingly they compelled even the men of the seaboard colonies, who, it was said, had an exemption that could not be touched, to furnish soldiers. When they refused, the consuls named a date for them to report to the senate on what basis each state had exemption. On that day these came before the senate: Ostia, Alsium, Antium, Anxur, Minturnae, Sinuessa, and from the Upper<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_363_1" id="target_note_LCL367_363_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Sea, Sena.
