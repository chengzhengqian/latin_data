had nothing to do. The hill facing them prevented them from attacking either in front or on the flank.</p>
<p>Between Livius and Hasdrubal a mighty battle had begun, and a savage slaughter on both sides was in progress. There both generals<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_401_1" id="target_note_LCL367_401_1"><sup>1</sup></a> were engaged, there the greater part of the Roman infantry and cavalry, there the Spanish troops, the old soldiers, acquainted also with the Roman mode of fighting, and the Ligurians, a hardy race of warriors.

Claudius shouted to his soldiers, “Why then have we covered so long a march at headlong speed?” and endeavoured without success to lead his line up the hill. Thereupon, after discovering that they could not get to the enemy in that direction, he drew off a number of cohorts from the right wing, where he saw that they would be standing idly by instead of fighting.

And such was his speed that, soon after showing themselves on the flank, they were already attacking the rear. Thus from all sides, front, flank, rear, the Spaniards and Ligurians
