was formerly in contact. Surely he had been deterred by no common disaster, and had not dared to pursue. Hasdrubal greatly feared that after all was lost he had himself come too late to assist, and that the Romans would have the same good fortune in Italy as in Spain. At times he believed his own letter had not reached Hannibal, and that the consul, upon intercepting it, had made haste, in order to overpower him. Troubled by these anxieties, he had the fires put out and orders given at the first watch that they should pack up their baggage in silence, and then he commanded the standards to advance. In the excitement and confusion of the night the guides were not closely watched, and one of them settled himself in a hiding-place he had previously determined upon, while the other swam across the river Metaurus, using a shallow place known to him. So the column, deserted by its guides, wandered at first about the country, and a considerable number, overcome by drowsiness and lack of sleep, threw themselves down anywhere and left few men with the standards. Hasdrubal ordered the standard-bearers to move along the bank of the river,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_397_1a" id="target_note_LCL367_397_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> until daylight should disclose a road.

Had Hasdrubal been on the left bank the treachery of his guides would have been of no consequence. For he would simply have followed the Flaminian Way. Livy represents them as vainly seeking for a road; therefore they were on the south side of the Metaurus. Polybius’ narrative at this point has not been preserved. It resumes with the battle formation (XI. i. 2). Cf. Frontinus I. i. 9; Zonaras IX. ix. 7–12; Appian <span class="italic">Hann.</span> 52; Valerius Max.
