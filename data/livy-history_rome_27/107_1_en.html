<h3><span class="ac">Summary of Book XXVII</span></h3>
<p>Gnaeus Fulvius, the proconsul, was slain with his army by Hannibal near Herdonea. With a happier outcome a battle was fought by Claudius Marcellus, the consul, against the same commander near Numistro. Hannibal thereupon withdrew by night. Marcellus pursued him and repeatedly bore heavily on him as he retreated, until he engaged. In the first battle Hannibal was the winner, Marcellus in the second. Fabius Maximus the father, as consul, recovered Tarentum by treachery. Claudius Marcellus and Titus Quinctius Crispinus, the consuls, having advanced from the camp to reconnoitre, were overpowered by Hannibal in an ambush. Marcellus was slain, Crispinus escaped. The ceremony of purification was completed by the censors. Listed in the census were 137,108 citizens, from which number it was evident how many men the unfavourable fortune of so many battles had carried off from the Roman people. In Spain Scipio engaged with Hasdrubal and Hamilcar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL367_415_1" id="target_note_LCL367_415_1"><sup>1</sup></a> near Baecula and was victorious. A boy of royal birth and remarkable beauty, who had been captured with the rest of the spoils, was sent away to his maternal uncle Masinissa by Scipio with gifts. Hasdrubal, who with a fresh army had crossed the Alps to unite with Hannibal, was slain with 56,000 men, and 5,400 were captured, under the command of Marcus Livius, the consul, but with no smaller share borne by Claudius Nero, the consul, who, after being assigned to confront Hannibal, had left his camp in such a way as to escape the enemyâ€™s notice, had set out with a picked force and overpowered Hasdrubal. The book contains in addition the operations successfully carried on by Publius Scipio in Spain and by Publius Sulpicius, the praetor, against Philip and the Achaeans.</p>
