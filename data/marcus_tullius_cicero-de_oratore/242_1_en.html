<p>Crassus delivered a specially prepared oration he almost invariably succeeded in giving the impression that he had never spoken better, nevertheless it was the unanimous verdict now that one who had always surpassed all the rest of the speakers had on this occasion surpassed even himself. He deplored the disaster and the bereavement that had befallen the senatorial order, whose hereditary dignities a consul whose duty it was to be its fostering parent or faithful guardian was plundering like some unprincipled brigand; but that nevertheless it was no matter for wonder if after his own policy had inflicted a disastrous blow on the state he was endeavouring to oust the wisdom of the Senate from the direction <span class="innerMarginNote left">4</span>of public affairs. Philip was a headstrong person, a fluent orator and one of the most courageous of adversaries; and when Crassus’s eloquence had put a match to the tinder, it was more than he could stand: he flared out violently, and took steps to coerce Crassus by seizing a pledge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_5_a" id="target_note_LCL349_5_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from him. At this particular juncture, it was reported, Crassus said a great deal that showed extraordinary sagacity. He protested that a consul who would not recognize him as a member of the Senate was to him no consul at all. “What, when you have reckoned all the authority of our whole order as a forfeited pledge and in the sight of the nation have destroyed it, do you imagine that these pledges can have any terrors for me? If your wish is to coerce Lucius Crassus, it is not those pledges that you have to destroy: you must cut out this tongue of mine—although even when this has been torn from my throat, my breath of itself will serve my liberty for the refutation of your licence.”</p>
