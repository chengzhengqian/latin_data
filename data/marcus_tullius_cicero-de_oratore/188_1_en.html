<span class="innerMarginNote left">240</span>facts, the other upon words. Upon facts, whenever any tale is told, some anecdote for instance, just as you, Crassus, alleged one day, in a speech against Memmius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL348_377_a" id="target_note_LCL348_377_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that Memmius ‘had made a mouthful of Largus’s arm,’ when brawling with him at Tarracina over a lady-love; it was a spicy story, but every word of your own fabrication.
