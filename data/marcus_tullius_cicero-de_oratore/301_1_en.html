invented to protect us against cold and afterwards began to be used for the sake of adornment and dignity as well, so the metaphorical employment of words was begun because of poverty, but was brought into common use for the sake of entertainment. For even country people speak of ‘jewelled vines,’ ‘luxurious herbage,’ ‘joyful harvests.’ The explanation is that when something that can scarcely be conveyed by the proper term is expressed metaphorically, the meaning we desire to convey is made clear by the resemblance of the thing that we have expressed by <span class="innerMarginNote left">156</span>the word that does not belong. Consequently the metaphors in which you take what you have not got from somewhere else are a sort of borrowing; but there is another somewhat bolder kind that do not indicate poverty but convey some degree of brilliance to the style. However there is no need for me to give you a lecture on the method of inventing these or on their classification.</p>

[<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_123_a" id="target_note_LCL349_123_a"><sup>a</sup></a>A metaphor is a short form of simile, contracted into one word; this word is put in a position not belonging to it as if it were its own place, and if it is recognizable it gives pleasure, but if it contains no similarity it is rejected.] But only such metaphors should be used as either make the meaning clearer, as for instance the following<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_123_b" id="target_note_LCL349_123_b"><sup>b</sup></a>:</p>
