<span class="innerMarginNote left">144</span><p>XXXII. “I had listened also to the traditional

precepts for the embellishment of discourse itself: that we must speak, in the first place, pure and correct Latin, secondly with simple lucidity, thirdly with elegance, lastly in a manner befitting the dignity of our topics and with a certain grace; and on these several points I had learnt particular <span class="innerMarginNote left">145</span>maxims. Moreover I had seen art called in to aid even those qualities which are peculiarly the endowment of nature: for example, concerning delivery and the memory, I had taken a taste of certain rules which, though concise, involved much practice.</p>
<p>“For it is matters like these that employ nearly

all the learning of your professors; and if I were to call this learning useless, I should be lying. For in fact it contains certain reminders, as it were, for the orator, as to the standard he must apply on each occasion, and must keep in mind, if he is not to wander from whatever course he has set himself. <span class="innerMarginNote left">146</span>But to my thinking the virtue in all the rules is, not that orators by following them have won a reputation for eloquence, but that certain persons have noted and collected the doings of men who were naturally eloquent: thus eloquence is not the offspring of the art, but the art of eloquence: even so, as I said before, I do not reject art, for though perhaps hardly essential to right speaking, still it is no ignoble help towards <span class="innerMarginNote left">147</span>right knowledge. There is also a certain practical training that you must undergo—though indeed you two are already in full career,—I mean it is for those who are at the start of their race, and can even thus early learn beforehand and practise, by a training like that for the games, what will have to be done in the fighting-line, so to speak, of the Courts.”</p>
