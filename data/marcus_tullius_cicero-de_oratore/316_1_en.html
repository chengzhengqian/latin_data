And at the same time it is not necessary to use long sentences and periods all the time; on the contrary, the discourse should frequently be divided up into smaller members, although these themselves should possess <span class="innerMarginNote left">191</span>a rhythmical unity of structure. Nor need you worry about the paeans or the dactyls we were talking about: they will turn up in prose of their own accordâ€”yes, they will fall in and report themselves as present without being summoned.
