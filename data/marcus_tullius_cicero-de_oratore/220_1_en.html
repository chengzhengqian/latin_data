our case must first be thoroughly considered and examined as a whole, and all our topics thought out and arranged, before we consider what opening to <span class="innerMarginNote left">319</span>employ. In this way just as openings will be easily discovered—for they will be taken from the subjects that will prove most fertile either in the argumentative passages or in the digressions upon which I said we must frequently enter—, so also they will contribute an element of movement, as they will be taken from almost the most essential part of the defence, and it will be felt not merely that they are not generalities and capable of being transferred into another case, but that they are essentially the natural outcome of the case under consideration.</p>
