<p class="noindent">or in whatever way a word is used not in its literal meaning but in a suggested sense.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">169</span><p>XLIII. “Often also we use<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_135_b" id="target_note_LCL349_135_b"><sup>b</sup></a> a word out of its literal sense in a less elegant manner than when it is used metaphorically, but this even though rather a loose use is nevertheless sometimes unobjectionable: for instance when we say a ‘full-length’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_135_c" id="target_note_LCL349_135_c"><sup>c</sup></a> speech instead of a ‘long’ speech, and a ‘petty’ mind for a ‘small’ mind. But the figure previously mentioned<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_135_d" id="target_note_LCL349_135_d"><sup>d</sup></a> consisting, as I explained, of a series of several metaphorical terms strung together, is a matter, do you notice, not of a word but of a sentence; whilst the figure now in question, consisting of words used as I said metonymously or in what is not their literal meaning, is a metaphor of a sort.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">170</span><p>“It follows that all merit and distinction in the use of words singly arises from three factors: the word may either be archaic but at the same time acceptable to habitual usage; or a coinage made by compounding two words, or inventing a new one—and here similarly consideration must be paid to what our ears are used to; or used metaphorically—a most effective way of introducing spots of high light to give brilliance to the style.</p>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">171</span><p>“There follows the question of periodic structure,
<span class="marginNote right">(<span class="italic">b</span>) Structure of the sentence: (1) syntax,</span>

which involves two things in particular, first arrangement and then rhythm and balance. It belongs to arrangement to place the words together in such a structure as not to have any harsh clash of consonants or hiatus of vowels, but a sort of connexion
