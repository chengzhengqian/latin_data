The president of the Court, who was in a hurry, answered, ‘Only if you are short.’ ‘You will not complain,’ returned Philippus, ‘for I shall be just as short as that man is.’ Quite comical; but there on the tribunal sat Lucius Aurifex, and he was even tinier than the witness: all the laughter was directed against Lucius, and the joke seemed merely buffoonish.
