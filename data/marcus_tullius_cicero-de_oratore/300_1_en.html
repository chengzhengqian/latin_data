which because of their antiquity have long passed out of use in everyday speech. These are more freely allowed to the licence of poets than to ourselves, but nevertheless on rare occasions even in oratory a poetic word has dignity. Indeed I should not be afraid to use Coelius’s phrase ‘what time the Carthaginian came into Italy,’ nor the word ‘offspring’ or ‘progeny,’ or ‘utter’ or ‘pronounce,’ or your favourite expressions, Catulus, ‘I did not deem’ or ‘I opined’; or many others that if used in the proper context often seem to have a way of adding</p>
