For could their own writings have made those orators known, perhaps I should have seen smaller need for this work that I have undertaken, but as one of them had written little (at all events little that survived), and had written that little in early life, while the other had left nothing whatever in writing, I thought that it was a tribute due from me to those great intellects, that while all still held them in living memory I should render that memory immortal, if I could. <span class="innerMarginNote left">9</span>And my hope is so much the greater that I shall establish the case which I am approaching, because I am not treating of the eloquence of Servius Galba or Gaius Carbo, in which case I should be able to invent at pleasure, no one now surviving to contradict me with his reminiscences, but I am publishing what will be criticized by those who have often actually listened to the men of whom I am speaking, in order that I may recommend an illustrious pair to those who have never seen either of them, on the testimony of the recollections of men to whom both those famous orators were personally known, and who themselves are living and still among us.</p>
