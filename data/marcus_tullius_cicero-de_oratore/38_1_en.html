anxious to humour your friends, and I shall make no difficulty about saying, in my brief fashion, what I think upon each point. And to that first question—since I do not think it dutiful, Scaevola, for me to disregard your claims—I answer, ‘I think there is either no art of speaking at all or a very thin one,’ all the quarrelling in learned circles being <span class="innerMarginNote left">108</span>really based upon a dispute about a word. For if, as Antonius just now explained, an art is defined as consisting in things thoroughly examined and clearly apprehended, and which are also outside the control of mere opinion, and within the grasp of exact knowledge, then to me there seems to be no such thing as an art of oratory. For all the kinds of language we ourselves use in public speaking are changeable matter, and adapted to the general <span class="innerMarginNote left">109</span>understanding of the crowd. If however the actual things noticed in the practice and conduct of speaking have been heeded and recorded by men of skill and experience, if they have been defined in terms, illuminated by classification, and distributed under subdivisions—and I see that it has been possible to do this—I do not understand why this should not be regarded as an art, perhaps not in that precise sense of the term, but at any rate according to the other and popular estimate. But whether this be an art, or only something like an art, assuredly it is not to be disdained; we must however understand that certain other qualifications are of greater consequence for the attainment of eloquence.”</p>
