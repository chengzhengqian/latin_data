I entertained the hope of being able to learn something from them, and did indeed find much in Greek life that was laughable and pungent, the inhabitants of Sicily, Rhodes, Byzantium, and particularly Athens having distinguished themselves in this kind of thing; all however who tried to teach anything like a theory or art of this matter proved themselves so conspicuously silly that their very silliness is the only laughable <span class="innerMarginNote left">218</span>thing about them. That is why I think that this accomplishment cannot possibly be imparted by teaching. For, there being two sorts of wit, one running with even flow all through a speech, while the other, though incisive, is intermittent, the ancients called the former ‘irony’ and the latter ‘raillery.’ <span class="innerMarginNote left">219</span>Each of these has a trivial name, but then of course all this business of laughter-raising is trivial.
