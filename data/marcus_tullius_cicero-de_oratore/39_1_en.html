heartily agreed with Crassus, in that he was neither wedded to Art with the devotion of those for whom the whole virtue of oratory resided in an art, nor on the other hand did he put her away altogether, as did most of the philosophers. “But I think, Crassus,” he continued, “that you will be doing these two a favour, if you will set forth those things which in your opinion may be more profitable to oratory than even Art herself.”</p>
