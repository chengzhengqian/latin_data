not hang together: ‘What does this gentleman lack—except cash and character?’ Another pretty turn is a friendly criticism of an implied mistake, as when Granius reproved Albius because, when Albucius was held to have proved a statement on the evidence of Albius’s accounts, Albius was not only much delighted by Scaevola’s acquittal but actually failed to see that a verdict had been given against his own <span class="innerMarginNote left">282</span>accounts. Also similar to this is giving a friendly hint by way of advice: for instance, when Granius was recommending an incompetent advocate who in the course of a speech had talked himself hoarse to have a drink of chilled wine and honey as soon as he got home, he answered ‘If I do that, I shall ruin my voice,’ and Granius retorted ‘Better ruin your voice <span class="innerMarginNote left">283</span>than ruin your client.’ It is also a neat turn to point out what goes with anybody’s individual characteristics; as for instance, when Scaurus was somewhat under a cloud for having taken possession of the estate of a wealthy person named Pompeius Phrygio who had died intestate, and was appearing in court as an assessor on behalf of a defendant named Bestia, a funeral happened to pass by, and Gaius Memmius who was for the prosecution said, ‘Look, Scaurus, there’s a dead man being bundled out of the way—if <span class="innerMarginNote left">284</span>only you can get possession.’ But of all these devices nothing causes more amusement than an unexpected turn, of which there are countless instances—for example, the remark of old Appius senior,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL348_413_a" id="target_note_LCL348_413_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who when there was a debate in the Senate about the
