anybody could be so hard-hearted as not to have <span class="innerMarginNote left">279</span>thought your speech a pitiable performance.’ For my own part I vow I am also much amused by those pettish and rather ill-tempered jests—but not when they are spoken by an ill-tempered person, for then it is not his wit but his character that we laugh at; and this point to my mind is very neatly put in the lines in Novius:</p>
