<p class="noindent">he could have completed the whole affair in a matter of ten verses! although the actual phrase ‘The funeral—we start,’ though very concise, nevertheless achieves not brevity but rather grace of style. <span class="innerMarginNote left">328</span>Supposing it had merely run ‘She was placed on the pyre,’ the whole of the facts could have been easily understood nevertheless; but the narrative gains liveliness when it brings in several characters and is broken up with speeches, and also one’s statement of what took place is both more convincing when one explains how it was done and much clearer to understand if occasionally a halt is called and the story <span class="innerMarginNote left">329</span>does not run right on with that curt brevity. The narrative ought to be as clear as all the other parts of the speech, but more pains must be taken to achieve clarity in this part because in narrating the facts of the case it is more difficult to avoid obscurity than in either the introduction or the proof or the peroration, and also obscurity is even more dangerous in this part of a speech than in the others, either because an obscure expression in any other place only causes the point obscurely expressed to be lost, but obscurity in the narrative blacks out the entire speech, or else because, whereas with other points if you have expressed them rather obscurely at one time you can express them more clearly in another place, there is only one place in a case for the narration. But clearness in the narration will be attained if it employs ordinary language, and if it keeps to the chronological order of events and is not broken by digressions.</p>
