taken it by storm, and as if it had come with permission, <span class="innerMarginNote left">166</span> not forced its way in. But there is no mode of speech more effective in the case of single words, and none that adds more brilliance to the style; for from this class of expression comes a development not consisting in the metaphorical use of a single word but in a chain of words linked together, so that something other than what is said has to be understood<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_131_a" id="target_note_LCL349_131_a"><sup>a</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Neither will I endure that I make shipwreck,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Like the Achaean fleet in days gone by,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A second time upon the self-same rock;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

This is a valuable stylistic ornament; but care must be taken to avoid obscurity—and in fact it is usually the way in which what are called riddles are constructed; but this mode does not turn on a single word but consists in the general style, that is, in a series of words. Nor yet does the figure of substitution or metonymy involve an innovation in a word:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent6">The rugged realm of Africa <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL349_131_b" id="target_note_LCL349_131_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
