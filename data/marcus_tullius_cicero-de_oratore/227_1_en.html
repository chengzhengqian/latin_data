to be the platform at a public meeting, it naturally results that we are stimulated to employ the more ornate kind of oratory; for the effect produced by numbers is of such a kind that a speaker can no more be eloquent without a large audience than a <span class="innerMarginNote left">339</span>flute-player can perform without a flute. And as there are a number of different ways of falling foul of the public, one must be careful not to arouse the disapproving outcries of the people, who are aroused either by some error in the speech, if a remark is thought to be harsh or arrogant or base or mean or to show some fault of character, or by personal annoyance or dislike that is either deserved or arises from slander and rumour, or if the subject is unpopular, or if the public is in a state of excitement arising out of some desire or alarm that it feels. These four causes of unpopularity can be met by as many remedies: sometimes by reproof, if one possesses authority, sometimes by admonition, which may be called a gentle form of reproof, sometimes by promising that if they will hear us out they will agree with us, and sometime, by apology, which is not a strong line to take, but is sometimes useful. <span class="innerMarginNote left">340</span>And in no other place is there more to be gained by using facetious turns and a rapid style and epigrammatic remarks expressed in a dignified and attractive way; for nothing is so easy as to divert a crowd from gloominess and often from bitter feeling by means of a neat and terse and pointed and amusing phrase.</p>
