<p>XIX. For a wine press make the guide-posts and anchor-posts two feet higher, and above the holes in the anchor-posts, which should be one foot apart, make a place for one pin. Cut six openings, a half-foot square, in each of the windlass beams, placing the first a half-foot from the tenon, and the others at equal intervals. Set a hook in the middle of the windlass; the centre of the distance between the anchor-posts should correspond with the middle of the windlass, where the hook should be set, in order to have the press-beam exactly in the middle. When you set the tongue, measure from the centre of the press-beam so that it may be exactly midway between the anchor-posts; allow one thumb width play. The longest levers are 18 feet, the second size 16, the third 15; the hand-spikes are 12, 10, and 8 feet respectively.</p>

The iron pivot which stands on the post must stand straight upright in the centre; it should be fastened firmly on all sides with willow wedges, and lead should be poured over it to prevent it from shaking; if it moves, take it out and fasten it again in the same way, so that it will not move. Make the sockets for the stones of orcite olive wood, and fasten them with lead, being careful to keep them tight. Fix them on the axle. Make one piece bushings, a thumb wide, flanged at both ends and double-nailed to keep them from falling out.</p>
