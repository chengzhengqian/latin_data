It is well for the master to have a well-built barn<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_11_2" id="target_note_LCL283_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and storage room and plenty of vats for oil and wine, so that he may hold his products for good prices; it will redound to his wealth, his self-respect, and his reputation. He should have good presses, so that the work may be done thoroughly. Let the olives be pressed immediately after gathering, to prevent the oil from spoiling. Remember that high winds come every year and are apt to beat off the olives; if you gather them at once and the presses are ready, there will be no loss on account of the storm, and the oil will be greener and better. If the olives remain too long on the ground or the floor they will spoil, and the oil will be rancid. Any sort of olive will produce a good and greener oil if it is pressed betimes. For an oliveyard of 120 iugera there should be two pressing equipments, if the trees are vigorous, thickly planted, and well cultivated. The mills should be stout and of different sizes, so that if the stones become worn you may change. Each should have its own leather ropes, six sets of hand bars, six double sets of pins, and leather belts.
