<p>C. If you intend to store oil in a new jar, first wash down the jar with crude amurca, shaking for a long time so that it may soak up the amurca thoroughly. If you do this, the jar will not soak up the oil, it will make the oil better, and the jar itself will be stronger.</p>

<p>CI. To preserve myrtle or any other twigs with the berries, or fig branches with the leaves, tie them together into bundles and plunge them into amurca until they are covered. But the fruit to be preserved should be picked a little before it is ripe, and the vessel in which it is stored should be sealed tight.</p>

<p>CIII. To keep cattle well and strong, and to increase the appetite of those which are off their feed, sprinkle the feed which you give with amurca. Feed in small quantities at first to let them grow accustomed to it, and then increase. Give them less often a draught of equal parts of amurca and water. Do this every fourth or fifth day. This treatment will keep them in better condition, disease will stay away from them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_97_3" id="target_note_LCL283_97_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
