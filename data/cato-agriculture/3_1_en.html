<p>II. When the master arrives at the farmstead, after paying his respects to the god of the household, let him go over the whole farm, if possible, on the same day; if not, at least on the next. When he has learned the condition of the farm, what work has been accomplished and what remains to be done, let him call in his overseer the next day and inquire of him what part of the work has been completed, what has been left undone; whether what has been finished was done betimes, and whether it is possible to complete the rest; and what was the yield of wine, grain, and all other products. Having gone into this, he should make a calculation of the labourers and the time consumed. If the amount of work does not seem satisfactory, the overseer claims that he has done his best, but that the slaves have not been well, the weather has been bad, slaves have run away, he has had public work<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_7_4" id="target_note_LCL283_7_4"><sup>4</sup></a> to do; when he has given these and many other excuses, call the overseer back to your estimate of the work done and the hands employed.

Their farms passed into the hands of capitalists, and the rich lands of Italy fell back into pasture, and half—naked slaves tended herds of cattle.” (Smith, <span class="italic">Rome and Carthage,</span> p. 230.) Grain farming
was no longer profitable, and it had become the custom to import grain from Sicily and Africa. The new Rome that emerged from this horrible war centred around a nobility of wealth and was in a state of demoralization. Such a condition naturally caused the cultivation of grain to be less important than that of the vine, the olive, domestic vegetables, or the rearing of cattle.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL283_7_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL283_7_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL283_7_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>The word is used of a plantation of trees, to which the vines were “wedded,” or of an orchard.
