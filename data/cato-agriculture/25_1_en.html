intervals to keep the stems from breaking, and when they begin to climb the props tie the tender branches loosely, and turn them so that they will grow vertically. When the grapes begin to turn, tie up the vines, strip the leaves so as to expose the grapes, and dig around the stocks.</p>
<p>Cut willows at the proper time, strip the bark, and tie them in tight bundles. Save the bark, and when you need it for the vines, steep some of it in water to make tapes. Save the withes for making baskets.</p>

<p>XXXIV. I return to the matter of planting. Plant the coldest and most humid ground first, and then the rest of the ground in turn to the warmest, which should come last. Do not work ground which is <span class="italic">cariosa</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_51_1" id="target_note_LCL283_51_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at all. Lupine<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_51_2" id="target_note_LCL283_51_2"><sup>2</sup></a> will do well in soil that is reddish, and also in ground that is dark, or hard, or poor, or sandy, or not wet. Sow spelt<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_51_3" id="target_note_LCL283_51_3"><sup>3</sup></a> preferably in soil that is chalky, or swampy, or red, or humid. Plant wheat in soil that is dry, free from weeds, and sunny.</p>

<p>XXXV. Plant beans in strong soil which is protected from storms; vetch and fenugreek<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_51_4" id="target_note_LCL283_51_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in places as clear of weeds as possible. Wheat and winter wheat should be sown on high, open ground, where the sun shines longest. Lentils should be planted in unfertile and reddish soil, free of weeds; barley in new ground, or ground which does not need to lie fallow. Spring wheat should be planted in ground in which you cannot ripen the regular variety, or in ground which, because of its strength, does not need to lie fallow. Plant turnips, kohlrabi seed, and radishes in land well manured or naturally strong.</p>
