<p>XXXIII. Have the vineyard treated as follows: Tie a well-knotted vine straight up, keeping it from bending, and make it grow vertically, so far as you can. Leave fruit-bearing shoots and reserve stubs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_49_3" id="target_note_LCL283_49_3"><sup>3</sup></a> at proper intervals. Train the vines as high as possible and tie them firmly, but without choking them. Cultivate as follows: At seed-time trench the soil around the crown of the vine, and after pruning cultivate around it. Begin ploughing, and run straight furrows back and forth. Set out young vines as early as possible, then harrow; prune the old ones very slightly, or rather, if you need cuttings, layer the branches and take off the cuttings two years later. The proper time for cutting back the young plant is when it is strong. If there are gaps in the rows, run furrows and plant rooted cuttings, keep the furrows clear of shade, and cultivate frequently. In an old vineyard sow clover if the soil is lean(do not sow anything that will form a head), and around the roots apply manure, straw, grape dregs, or anything of the sort, to make it stronger. When the vine begins to form leaves, thin them. Tie up the young vines at frequent
