with your means. If you build substantially on a good farm, placing the house in a good situation, so that you can live comfortably in the country, you will like to visit it, and will do so oftener; the farm will improve, there will be less wrongdoing, and you will receive greater returns; the forehead is better than the hindhead.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_13_1" id="target_note_LCL283_13_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Be a good neighbour, and do not let your people commit offences.

<p>V. The following are the duties of the overseer:—He must show good management. The feast days must be observed. He must withhold his hands from another’s goods and diligently preserve his own. He must settle disputes among the slaves; and if anyone commits an offence he must punish him properly in proportion to the fault. He must see that the servants are well provided for, and that they do not suffer from cold or hunger. Let him keep them busy with their work—he will more easily keep them from wrongdoing and meddling. If the overseer sets his face against wrongdoing, they will not do it; if he allows it, the master must not let him go unpunished. He must express his appreciation of good work, so that others may take pleasure in well-doing. The overseer must not be a gadabout, he must always be sober, and must not go out to dine. He must keep the servants busy, and see that the master’s orders are carried out.
