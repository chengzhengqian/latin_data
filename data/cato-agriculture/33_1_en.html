Lay poles in the forks, and on these hang brush or fig-curtains,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_67_1" id="target_note_LCL283_67_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to keep off cold and sun. Make the covering high enough for a person to walk under. Hoe often, and clear off the weeds as soon as they begin to grow; for if you pull up the growth when it is hard, you will pull up the cypress with it.</p>
<p>Plant and cover pear and apple seed in the same way. Use the same method for planting pine-nuts, but alter it slightly.</p>

<p>XLIX. You may transplant an old vine if you wish, up to the thickness of your arm.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_67_2" id="target_note_LCL283_67_2"><sup>2</sup></a> First prune back so as to leave not more than two buds on each branch; clear the dirt thoroughly from the roots over their full length, and be careful not to injure them. Replace the vine just as it was, in a trench or furrow, cover with soil, and trample firmly. Plant, tie, and train it just as it was, and work it often.</p>

<p>L. Manure meadows at the opening of spring, in the dark of the moon. When the west wind begins to blow and you close the dry meadows to stock, clean them and dig up all noxious weeds by the roots.</p>
<p>After pruning vines, pile the wood and branches; prune fig trees moderately, and clear those in the vineyard to a good height, so that the vines will not climb them; make new nurseries and repair old ones. All this before you begin cultivating the vines.</p>
<p>As soon as the sacred feast has been offered and eaten,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_67_3" id="target_note_LCL283_67_3"><sup>3</sup></a> begin the spring ploughing, working first the driest spots and last the heaviest and wettest, provided they do not get hard in the meantime.</p>
