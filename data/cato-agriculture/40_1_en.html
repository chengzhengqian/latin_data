incense, 3 plants of Sabine herb, 3 leaves of rue,. 3 stalks of bryony, 3 white beans, 3 live coals, and 3 pints of wine. You must gather, macerate, and administer all these while standing,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_81_1" id="target_note_LCL283_81_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and he who administers the remedy must be fasting.

Macerate this skin, spelt, salt, and thyme with wine, and give it to all the cattle to drink. See that the cattle always have good, clear water to drink in summer-time; it is important for their health.</p>
