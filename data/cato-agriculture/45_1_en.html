the neck of a clean amphora, fill with clear water, and place in the sun. Suspend in it a basket filled with common salt and shake and renew from time to time. Do this daily several times a day until the salt ceases to dissolve for two days. You can find when it is saturated by this test: place a small dried fish or an egg in it, and if it floats you have a brine strong enough to pickle meat or cheese or salted fish. Place this brine in flat vessels or in pans and expose it to the sun. Keep it in the sun until it solidifies, and you will have a pure salt. In cloudy weather or at night put it under cover, but expose it to the sun every day when there is sunshine.</p>

<p>LXXXIX. To cram hens or geese: Shut up young hens which are beginning to lay; make pellets of moist flour or barley-meal, soak in water, and push into the mouth. Increase the amount daily, judging from the appetite the amount that is sufficient. Cram twice a day, and give water at noon, but do not place water before them for more than one hour. Feed a goose the same way, except that you let it drink first, and give water and food twice a day.</p>

<p>XC. To cram squabs: After catching the squab feed it first boiled and toasted beans, blowing them from your mouth into its mouth, and water the same way; do this for seven days. Then clean crushed beans and spelt; let one-third the quantity of beans come to a boil, then pour in the spelt, keeping it clean, and boil thoroughly. When you have turned it out of the pot, knead it thoroughly, after greasing the hand with oil—a small quantity first, then more—greasing and kneading until you can make pellets. Feed the food in moderate quantities, after soaking it.</p>
