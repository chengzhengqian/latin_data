<p>LI. Layering of fruit trees and other trees: Press into the earth the scions which spring from the ground around the trees, elevating the tip so that it will take root.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_69_1" id="target_note_LCL283_69_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Then two years later dig up and transplant them. Fig, olive, pomegranate, quince, and all other fruit trees, laurel, myrtle, Praenestine nuts, and planes should all be layered, dug, and transplanted in the same way.</p>

When it is two years old, cut off the branch below the basket; cut the basket down the side and through the bottom, or, if it is a pot, break it, and plant the branch in the trench with the basket or pot.

<p>LIV. Feed for cattle should be prepared and fed as follows: When the sowing is over, gather the acorns and soak them in water. A half-modius of this should be fed each ox per day, though if the oxen are not working it will be better to let them forage; or feed a modius of the grape husks which you have stored in jars. During the day let them forage, and
