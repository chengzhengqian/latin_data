six sextarii of water and add the hock of a ham, or, if you have no hock, a half-pound of ham-scraps with as little fat as possible.

two pounds of mussels, a capito<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_153_2" id="target_note_LCL283_153_2"><sup>2</sup></a> fish and one scorpion, six snails, and a handful of lentils. Boil all together down to three sextarii of liquid, without adding oil. Take one sextarius of this while warm, add one cyathus of Coan wine, drink, and rest. Take a second and a third dose in the same way, and you will be well purged. You may drink diluted Coan wine in addition, if you wish. Any one of the many ingredients mentioned above is sufficient to move the bowels; but there are so many ingredients in this concoction that it is an excellent purgative, and, besides, it is agreeable.</p>

<p>CLX. Any kind of dislocation may be cured by the following charm: Take a green reed four or five feet long and split it down the middle, and let two men hold it to your hips. Begin to chant: “motas uaeta daries dardares astataries dissunapiter”
and continue until they meet. Brandish a knife over them, and when the reeds<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_153_3" id="target_note_LCL283_153_3"><sup>3</sup></a> meet so that one touches the other, grasp with the hand and cut right and left. If the pieces are applied to the dislocation or the fracture, it will heal. And none the less chant every day, and, in the case of a dislocation, in this manner, if you wish: “huat haut haut istasis tarsis ardannabou dannaustra.”</p>
