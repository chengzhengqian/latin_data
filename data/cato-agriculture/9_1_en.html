to be the best for these districts. Plant this variety of olives at intervals of twenty-five or thirty feet. Land which is suitable for olive planting is that which faces the west and is exposed to the sun; no other will be good. Plant the Licinian olive in colder and thinner soil. If you plant it in heavy or warm soil the yield will be worthless, the tree will exhaust itself in bearing, and a reddish scale will injure it. Around the borders of the farm and along the roads plant elms and some poplars, so that you may have leaves for the sheep and cattle; and the timber will be available if you need it. Wherever there is a river bank or wet ground, plant poplar cuttings and a reed thicket. The method of planting is as follows:—turn the ground with the mattock and then plant the eyes of the reed three feet apart. Plant there also the wild asparagus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_19_1" id="target_note_LCL283_19_1"><sup>1</sup></a> so that it may produce asparagus; for a reed thicket goes well with the wild asparagus, because it is worked and burned over, and furnishes a shade when shade is needed. Plant Greek willows along the border of the thicket, so that you may have withes for tying up vines.</p>
<p>Choose soil for laying out a vineyard by the following rules:—In soil which is thought to be best adapted for grapes and which is exposed to the sun, plant the small Aminnian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_19_2" id="target_note_LCL283_19_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the double eugeneum, and the small parti-coloured; in soil that is heavy or more subject to fogs plant the large Aminnian, the Murgentian, the Apician, and the Lucanian. The other varieties, and especially the hybrids, grow well anywhere.</p>
