bolt. Fill the interval between the two anchor-posts with oak, and pour lead over it. Let the head of the anchor-posts project six fingers, and cap it with an oak head so as to make a place for the posts to stand. Make a 5-foot foundation and lay on it a flat stone, 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 by 1 1/2 feet, and set the posts on it. Mount the corresponding posts in the same way. Above the anchor-posts and the guide-posts lay a horizontal beam, 2 feet by 1, 37 feet long, or two beams if you have no solid ones of that size. Under these beams, between the conduits and the end walls, in the position of the mills, run a beam 1 1/2 feet square and 23 1/2 feet long, or two pieces. On these rest the beams which stand above the main posts, and on these timbers build a wall and join it to the timber to give it sufficient weight. Where you are to build a seat for the press make a foundation 5 feet deep, 6 feet across; the seat and circular conduit 4 1/2 feet in diameter. For the rest of the pavement make the foundation uniformly 2 feet deep. First pack down the bottom, and then spread successive half-foot layers of finely crushed stone and sanded lime. Construct the pavement as follows: After levelling, spread the first layer of gravel and sanded lime, and tamp it down; then spread a similar layer over it, sift lime with a sieve to the depth of two fingers, and then lay a pavement of dry potsherds. When completed, pack and rub down so as to have a smooth surface. All anchor-posts and guide-posts should be of oak or pine. If you wish to use shorter timbers, cut conduits on the outside; if this method is employed you will need 22-foot timbers. Make the disk 4 feet in diameter, 6 fingers thick, constructed in sections in the Punic style with
