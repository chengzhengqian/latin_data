<p>XLVI. Make a nursery as follows: Choose the best, the most open, and the most highly fertilized land you have, with soil as nearly as possible like that into which you intend to transplant, and so situated that the slips will not have to be carried too far from the nursery. Turn this with a trench spade, clear of stones, build a stout enclosure, and plant in rows. Plant a slip every foot and a half in each direction, pressing into the ground with the foot; and if it does not go deep enough, drive it in with a mallet or maul. Let the slips project a finger above the ground, and smear the tops with cow dung, placing a mark by each; hoe often if you wish the slips to grow rapidly. Plant other slips in the same way.</p>

<p>XLVII. The reed bed should be planted as follows: Plant the eyes three feet apart.</p>
<p>Use the same method for making and planting the vine nursery. Cut back the vine when it is two years old and transplant when it is three. If the ground on which you wish to plant the vine is to be used for pasture, see that the vine has been cut back three times before it is tied up to the tree; it should not be trained on the tree until it has five old knots. Plant a leek-bed every year, and you will have something to take off every year.</p>

<p>XLVIII. In making the fruit nursery follow the method used in making the olive nursery. Plant separately each variety of slip.</p>
<p>Turn the ground with a trench spade where you are going to plant cypress seed, and plant at the opening of spring. Make ridges<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL283_65_1" id="target_note_LCL283_65_1"><sup>1</sup></a> five feet wide, add well-pulverized manure, hoe it in, and break the clods. Flatten the ridge, forming a shallow trough. Plant the seed as thickly as flax, sifting dirt a fingerbreadth
