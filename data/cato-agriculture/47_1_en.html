one-fourth sextarius of sulphur, pulverize each in a mortar separately, and add in very small quantities to the warm amurca, at the same time stirring with a stick, and let it boil again in the open; for if you boil it under cover it will blaze up when the mixture of bitumen and sulphur is added. When it reaches the consistency of glue let it cool. Apply this around the trunk and under the branches, and caterpillars will not appear.</p>

<p>XCVI. To keep scab from sheep; Take equal parts of old strained amurca, water in which lupines have been boiled, and dregs of good wine, and mix all together. After shearing, smear the whole body with this, and let them sweat two or three days. Then wash them in the sea, or, if you have no sea-water, make a brine and wash them in it. If you do this as directed, they will not have the scab, will bear more wool and of better quality, and ticks will not bother them. Use the same remedy for all quadrupeds if they have the scab.</p>

<p>XCVIII. To protect clothing from moths: Boil amurca down to one-half its volume and rub it over the bottom, the outside, the feet, and the corners of the chest. After it is dry, store the clothing and the moths will not attack it. Also, if you rub it over the whole surface of wooden furniture it will prevent decay, and the article when rubbed will have a higher polish. You may also use it as a polish for any kind of copper vessel, after cleaning the article thoroughly. After applying the amurca, rub the vessel when it is to be used; it will have a lustre, and will be protected from rust.</p>
