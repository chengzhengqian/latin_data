<p>XII. But as for you,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">37</span><span class="br"></span> Caecilius—and I would assure you that I am now going to speak to you as one friend to another, without reference to the present competition between us—I earnestly advise you to examine your own mind. Recollect yourself. Think of what you are, and of what you are fit for. This is a formidable and very painful undertaking, which involves the cause of our allies and the welfare of our province, the rights of our own nation, and the authority of our law and our courts of law. These are not light or simple matters to take upon you: have you the powers of voice and memory, have you the intelligence and the ability to sustain such a burden? Think<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span>
of the crimes that Verres has committed as quaestor, as legate, and as praetor, at Rome and in Italy, in Achaia and Asia and Pamphylia: do you think yourself able to charge him with all these, arranging and distinguishing them properly, according to the times and places at which they respectively occurred? Do you think you can do what is especially necessary in prosecuting a man on such charges as these—make
all his acts of lust and impiety and cruelty excite as much pain, and as much indignation, in those who are told of them here, as they excited in those who underwent them there? I assure you,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span>
these things of which I tell you are no trifles, and you must not think of them lightly. You have to mention everything, establish every fact, expound everything in full. You have not merely to state your case: you have to develop it with impressive wealth of detail. If you wish to achieve any sort of success, you must not only make people listen to you: you must make them listen with pleasure, with eagerness.
