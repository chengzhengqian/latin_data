named Agonis, formerly a slave of Venus of Eryx. This woman, in the days before Caecilius was quaestor, had very considerable wealth and property. An admiral serving under Antonius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_51_a" id="target_note_LCL221_51_a"><sup>a</sup></a> wronged her by carrying off a number of her slave musicians, whom he said he required for service in the navy. She thereupon followed the regular practice of those Sicilians who belong to Venus, or who having belonged to her have since become free. She used the name of Venus to make the admiral afraid of committing sacrilege, and stated that she, and all that belonged to her, were the property of the goddess. When this was reported to Caecilius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">56</span><span class="br"></span>
as quaestor, that excellent man and paragon of justice sent for Agonis, and at once appointed a court with instructions to decide “Whether<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_51_b" id="target_note_LCL221_51_b"><sup>b</sup></a> she was guilty of having said that she and her property were the property of Venus.” The members of the court gave the only decision possible: for no one had the least doubt that Agonis had spoken thus. Caecilius took possession of the woman’s property, and adjudged the woman herself to be the slave of Venus: then he sold her property, and paid the money he got for it into his account.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_51_c" id="target_note_LCL221_51_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Thus Agonis, just for using the sacred name of Venus in order to keep possession of a few slaves, was most unjustly deprived by Caecilius of all her property, and of her freedom as well. Later on, Verres arrived at Lilybaeum. He investigated the matter, annulled the judgement, and obliged his quaestor to pay over to Agonis the full sum he had realized by the sale of her property. So far, as I see you all note with surprise,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">57</span><span class="br"></span>
Verres is not Verres but a perfect Scaevola.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_51_d" id="target_note_LCL221_51_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Could he have added more gracefully to his public
