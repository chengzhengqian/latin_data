Men of high rank, who have come here from every part of the province, stand before you, gentlemen, to beg and pray that when you choose the man to manage their case for them, there may be no variance between your judgement and their own. Deputations are present from every community in Sicily except two: and had they come from these two also, it would but mitigate the force of two extremely serious charges against Verres, relating to matters in which he has made these two communities his accomplices.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_15_a" id="target_note_LCL221_15_a"><sup>a</sup></a> It may<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
