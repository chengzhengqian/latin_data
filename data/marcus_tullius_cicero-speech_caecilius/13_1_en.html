The Sicilians are the only people who have hitherto had the opportunity of knowing much about you; and although the hostility of the Sicilians is directed against the man whose enemy you profess yourself to be, yet what they say is that, if you are to conduct the case, they will not appear at the trial.

The opinion of the Sicilians, certainly, is not that you are anxious to procure from their country documentary evidence against Verres.
