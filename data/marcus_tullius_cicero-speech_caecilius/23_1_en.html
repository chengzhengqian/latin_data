instead of finding themselves victims of their own social standing in the neighbourhood of the Maenian Column<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL221_47_a" id="target_note_LCL221_47_a"><sup>a</sup></a>? “Set me to keep watch on Tullius,” says one of them.

good many people to keep watch, if I ever let <span class="italic">you</span> have access to my cupboards. <span class="italic">You</span> will certainly want watching, or you will not only let out my secrets but go off with my property. However, in answer to these gentlemen’s proposal to watch me, a few words will be enough.

For what reply will you make? Perhaps what you are always repeating, that Verres has wronged you. I can well believe that. He has wronged everyone in Sicily, and it would be too much to expect that he should make you a special exception by forwarding your interests. But while the rest of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">53</span><span class="br"></span>
the Sicilians have found themselves a man to avenge
