Maecenas drew out the grand style of the thundering poet and revealed famous names to the peoples of Greece. Likewise he made known to fame songs resonant on Roman strings and the Italian lyre of graceful Horace. Hail! ornament of the age, worshipful deservedly for all time, protection of the Pierian choir, beneath whose guardianship never did poet fear for an old age of beggary.</p>
<p>But if there is any room for entreaties of mine, if my prayers have reached your heart, then you, Piso, shall one day be chanted in polished verse, to be enshrined in memory as my Maecenas. I can consign a name to everlasting renown, if after all ‘tis right for any man to promise this of himself, and if the avenging god is absent:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_315_a" id="target_note_LCL284_315_a">
<sup>a</sup>
</a> there is abundance of spirited will, and the mind itself ventures on something of surpassing quality. Do you stretch out your hand to a swimmer:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL284_315_b" id="target_note_LCL284_315_b">
<sup>b</sup>
</a> do you, Piso, bring to the light one who is obscure. The home of my sires, humble but true, along with its slender fortune hides me in its own darkness. I can clear my head of its enshrouding burden, I can behold fresh light, if you, my fairsouled friend, do but cheerfully approve and support my aspirations. I have, trust me, a spirit firmer than my years, though youth’s comeliness has just begun to shade my cheeks and my twentieth summer is not yet at hand.</p>
