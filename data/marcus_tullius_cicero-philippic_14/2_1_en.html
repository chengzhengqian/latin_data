will be a most glorious day for him, they wish to deprive

so misguided a proposal.</p>
<p>But do you, Members of the Senate, maintain your authority,
stand by your opinion, keep fixedly in mind that
which you have often made plain: that the decision in this
entire war turns on the life of one very great and gallant
man.</p>
