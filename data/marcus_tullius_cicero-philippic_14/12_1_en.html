<p>[9] Therefore, when I salute our commanders as “imperators,”
I am expressing in words what Servilius is expressing
in fact: by this very title I declare enemies both
those already thoroughly vanquished and those who remain.
How better should I address Pansa, though he bears<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>
the title of our highest public office? Or Hirtius? He is consul,
to be sure, but that title came as the gift of the Roman
people, while this one is conferred by valor and victory.
What of Caesar, him who was engendered for the sake of
the Republic by the favor of the Gods? Am I to hesitate to
salute him as imperator—Caesar, who was the first to turn
Antonius’ foul, monstrous cruelty aside not only from our
throats, but also from our limbs and vitals?</p>
<p>Immortal gods, how many and how great were the
deeds of valor that a single day brought forth! Pansa was<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span>
first among them all to join battle and clash with Antonius:
a commander worthy of the Martian Legion, as the legion
is worthy of its commander. And if Pansa had been able to
restrain their passionate onslaught, the issue would have
been settled in a single engagement. But when in their eagerness
for freedom the legion broke too impetuously into
the enemy’s lines and Pansa himself was fighting among
the foremost, he received two dangerous wounds and was
removed from the field to reserve his life for the Republic.
I declare him not only imperator but also a most illustrious
imperator, who having pledged himself to do his duty to
the Republic by either death or victory, has achieved the
one and as for the other, may the immortal gods avert the
omen!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_317_30" id="target_note_LCL507_317_30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
