vote; that cannot now be done in the present case. Pursuant
to dispatches from the consuls Gaius Pansa and Aulus
Hirtius and propraetor Gaius Caesar, we are voicing our
proposals concerning the payment of honor to the immortal
gods. The senator who just proposed a public thanksgiving<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_315_24" id="target_note_LCL507_315_24"><sup>24</sup></a>
has in so doing, and unbeknown to himself, declared
them enemies; for no public thanksgiving has ever
been voted in a civil war.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_315_25" id="target_note_LCL507_315_25"><sup>25</sup></a> “Voted,” did I say? Indeed, none
has ever been asked for in a victor’s dispatch. Sulla as consul<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>
fought a civil war; he marched his legions into Rome,
banished whom he chose, killed whom he could: no mention
of a public thanksgiving. A major war, the war of
Octavius, came next: no public thanksgiving for the victor.
Sulla as imperator avenged Cinna’s victory: no public
thanksgiving voted by the senate. To you yourself, Publius
Servilius, surely your colleague<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_315_26" id="target_note_LCL507_315_26"><sup>26</sup></a> did not send any dispatch
concerning the disastrous Battle of Pharsalia, did he? Nor
did he want you to consult the senate concerning a public
thanksgiving, did he? Of course he didn’t. But he sent one
subsequently concerning Alexandria and another concerning
Pharnaces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_315_27" id="target_note_LCL507_315_27"><sup>27</sup></a> For the Battle of Pharsalia he did not celebrate
a triumph either. For if those citizens whom that
battle took away had not only lived but been victorious, the
community could have survived and prospered. That was<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span>
likewise the case in previous civil wars. For to me as consul
a public thanksgiving of a new and unheard of sort was decreed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_315_28" id="target_note_LCL507_315_28"><sup>28</sup></a>
without there being any resort to arms, voted not
on account of the slaughter of enemies but of the preservation
of citizens. Therefore, either you must refuse a public
thanksgiving to our commanders for their splendid successes
on behalf of the Republic when they are asking for
it, something that has never happened to anybody except
