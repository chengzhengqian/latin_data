and so in order to bring me into odium or even peril of my
life when that happened, they spread this rumor about the
fasces. They themselves were even going to offer me the
fasces,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_309_16" id="target_note_LCL507_309_16"><sup>16</sup></a> and when this had been done as though at my own
wish, an attack upon me by a hired gang was planned, as if
upon a despot. From this there would have followed a massacre
of all you senators. These plans, Members of the Senate,

had never entertained any but the most loyal thoughts concerning
the Republic. Two or three hours after the meeting
came the messengers and dispatches we were praying
for. Thus the same day not only relieved me of a most unjust
