a city lawsuit, not brands of deadly warfare. They forge
wills, no doubt, or expel their neighbors from their property,
or defraud young men: those who indulge in these
and similar evil ways are customarily called “bad” or “reckless.”
An inexpiable war is being waged upon four consuls<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
by the most savage bandit under the sun. He also wages
war against the senate and people of Rome. He threatens
us all—though he himself is collapsing under the weight of
his own disasters—with destruction, devastation, and the
pains of torture. He testifies that Dolabella’s brutal and
monstrous act, which no race of barbarians could acknowledge,
was carried out on his advice; what he would have
done in this city, had not Jupiter here<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_301_6" id="target_note_LCL507_301_6"><sup>6</sup></a> himself thrust him
back from this temple and our city’s walls, he made plain in
the ruin of the inhabitants of Parma, who, very loyal and
respectable folk, closely attached to the authority of this
body and the dignity of the Roman people, were most cruelly
slaughtered to serve as an object lesson at the hands of
that vile monster Lucius Antonius, the conspicuous target
of all men’s hatred, of all gods’ too, if the gods hate whom
they ought. My mind recoils, Members of the Senate, and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
shudders to speak of what Lucius Antonius did in the case
of the wives and children of the people of Parma. The
Antonii delight in having inflicted upon others by violence
the degradations to which they themselves have cheerfully
and disgracefully submitted. But it is calamitous violence
that they made those people suffer; it is scandalous lust
that stains the lives of the Antonii. Is there anyone, then,
who hesitates to call enemies men whose crimes, he admits,
put the cruelty of the Carthaginians into the shade?</p>
