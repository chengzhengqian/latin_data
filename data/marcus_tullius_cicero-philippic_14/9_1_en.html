regard the merit of outstanding citizens as deserving imitation,
not envy. Public life is a broad field, as Marcus
Crassus was in the habit of wisely saying,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_311_20" id="target_note_LCL507_311_20"><sup>20</sup></a> and the path to

community were still alive who not unwillingly saw me in a
position of leadership after my consulship, though I myself

for brave and resolute consulars, what distress do you think
I feel when I see some expressing disloyal sentiments, others
