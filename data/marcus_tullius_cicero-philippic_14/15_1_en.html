<p>[12] Therefore, Members of the Senate, I recommend
the erection of a monument on the grandest possible scale
to the soldiers of the Martian Legion and to those who fell
fighting at their side.</p>
<p>Great and extraordinary are the services of this legion
to the Republic. This legion was the first to sever itself
from Antonius’ banditry; this held Alba; this went over

you who breathed your last in victory have gained the
dwelling place of pious souls. Brief is the life granted us by
nature, but the memory of a life nobly sacrificed is eternal.

who would be so mad as to strive after highest praise and
glory at the cost of most grievous toils and perils?</p>

while you lived and now also most revered because
your valor will be able to be buried neither in the oblivion
of the present generation nor in the silence of posterity,
since the senate and people of Rome will raise for you, I
