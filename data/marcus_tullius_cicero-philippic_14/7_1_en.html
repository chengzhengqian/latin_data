true worth make no return of gratitude to those who deserve
well? Will even those who devote all their care to the
preservation of the Republic be targets for backbiting and
envy? You know that during the past few days there was a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>

to invent this tale or so mad as to believe it?</p>

talk?</p>

report from Mutina was circulating, our traitorous fellow
citizens, puffed up with joy and insolence, gathered
together in one place, in that senate-house of theirs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_307_15a" id="target_note_LCL507_307_15a"><sup>15</sup></a> a
place of ill omen for their own mad designs rather than for
