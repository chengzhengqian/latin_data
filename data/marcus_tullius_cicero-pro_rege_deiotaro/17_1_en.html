“Blesamius,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_533_a" id="target_note_LCL252_533_a"><sup>a</sup></a> he says—for it was under the name of this excellent man, with whom, Caesar, you are not unacquainted, that he proceeded to slander you,—“was in the habit of writing to the king, saying that you were under a cloud, that you were looked upon as a tyrant, that public feeling had been gravely affronted by the placing of your statue among those of the kings, and that no applause greeted you.” Do you not realize, Caesar, that these fellows have gleaned these statements from the evil insinuations of street-corner
gossipers? Blesamius to write of Caesar as a tyrant! Yes, for he had seen the heads of many citizens,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_533_b" id="target_note_LCL252_533_b"><sup>b</sup></a> many by Caesar’s orders persecuted, scourged, done to death; many homes devastated and overthrown; the forum packed with armed soldiery. What we have always experienced in the victories of civil warfare, we did not see when you were victor. Yes, you, Gaius Caesar, are the only conqueror in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span>
whose hour of triumph none save combatants have fallen. We, free men born in freedom’s fairest clime, so far from finding you a tyrant, have seen in you a leader of unbounded mercy in the day of victory; and can Blesamius, the subject of a despot, deem you a tyrant? For as to the statue, who complains of that—one statue when he sees so many? Fine reason, indeed, to resent the statues of one whose trophies we have not resented! For if it is the <span class="italic">position</span> of the statue that arouses resentment, there is no place for a statue more splendid than the rostra.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_533_c" id="target_note_LCL252_533_c"><sup>c</sup></a> And as to the applause, what answer shall I make? To win applause was at no time your aim, and sometimes it has been silenced because sheer wonder struck men dumb, or perhaps omitted because nothing commonplace seems worthy of you.</p>
