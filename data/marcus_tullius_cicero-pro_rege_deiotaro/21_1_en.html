of their kings, Hieras, Blesamius, and Antigonus, men long known to you and to us all; while Dorylaus, their peer in honour and merit, was lately sent to you with Hieras upon a mission. All these are not only close friends of the kings, but have also, I trust, deserved of your approbation.

whether he has written to the king a word in disparagement of your dignity. Hieras bears the whole burden of the case, and stands at the bar to answer these charges as substitute for his king. He appeals to your memory which is excellent; he says that he never stirred a foot’s length from you while you were in Deiotarus’s tetrarchy; that he joined you on the one frontier and escorted you all the way to the other; that he was with you when you came from the bath, when you inspected those gifts after dinner, and when you lay down in your chamber; and that on the following day he waited upon you with no less assiduity. Wherefore if any of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">43</span><span class="br"></span>
