and supplies the army of the brave Gnaeus Domitius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_513_a" id="target_note_LCL252_513_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; he sent funds to Ephesus to one whom you selected as the most loyal and respected out of all your adherents<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_513_b" id="target_note_LCL252_513_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; he it was who, after holding two, nay three, auctions, contributed to your war funds; he it was who exposed his person to peril, fought at your side in the field against Pharnaces,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_513_a" id="target_note_LCL252_513_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and deemed your enemy his own.
