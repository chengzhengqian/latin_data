For when the chattel that sits at our hearth can swagger abroad at will and do battle against us, then servitude rises to mastery, and mastery sinks to servitude. Times have indeed changed, and manners<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span>
with them! When the great Gnaeus Domitius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_531_a" id="target_note_LCL252_531_a"><sup>a</sup></a> whom our boyhood’s days saw as consul, censor, and Pontifex Maximus, had as tribune of the plebs summoned Marcus Scaurus, the leading citizen of his time, before a popular court, and when a slave of Scaurus had come secretly to his house offering to lay charges against his master, Domitius ordered the fellow to be arrested and haled before Scaurus. I do wrong to compare Castor with Domitius, but mark the difference: <span class="italic">he</span> sent back the slave to his enemy, <span class="italic">you</span> seduced him from your grandfather; <span class="italic">he</span> would not listen to an unbribed slave, <span class="italic">you</span> bribed him; <span class="italic">he</span> spurned the aid of a slave against his master, you actually employed him as accuser. Oh but he was only<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span>

Did he not betake himself to Gnaeus Domitius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_531_b" id="target_note_LCL252_531_b"><sup>b</sup></a> here? Did he not, in the hearing of the renowned Servius Sulpicius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_531_c" id="target_note_LCL252_531_c"><sup>c</sup></a> who happened to be dining with Domitius at the time, and of my excellent young friend here Titus Torquatus, admit that he had been bribed by you, and by your promises driven to evil courses?</p>

<p>XII. What headstrong, what pitiless, what unbridled barbarity is this you display! Is it for this that you have visited our city?—to subvert that city’s laws and traditions and to contaminate the amenities of our society by the monstrous perversion of domestic intercourse?</p>
<p>But how astutely has he raked together his charges!<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span>
