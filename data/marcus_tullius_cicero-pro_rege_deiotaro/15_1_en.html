convert him to my views, for not only was he on fire with zeal for the war, but considered that he must satisfy his father’s claims upon him. Happy indeed is your house, which has won not merely impunity but even unrestrained licence in impeachment; and unhappy is Deiotarus your victim, for he is impeached by one who served under the same banner, impeached too not only in your presence, Caesar, but by his own flesh and blood. Can you and your associates, Castor, not rest content in your prosperity? Must you also involve your kinsmen in ruin?</p>

business to exist, for it was King Deiotarus who called your family into the light when it lay in the darkness of despised obscurity; who had ever heard who your father was until he became some one’s son-in-law?—still,
however ungratefully and unnaturally you repudiated the title of kinship, you might yet have carried on your feuds like gentlemen, instead of dogging him with a trumped-up charge, thirsting for his life-blood, and arraigning him on a capital offence. Well, let us even allow that you are justified in carrying your acrimony and hatred to this unconscionable length; can we extend your licence to the violation of every law of life, of general well-being, and even of humanity? To unsettle by your suggestions the loyalty of a slave, to seduce him by promises and expectations, to inveigle him to your home, to arm him against his master—this is to declare an unholy war not against a single kinsman but against every household. For if your corruption of a slave should not merely pass unpunished, but should have the seal of approbation set upon it in so high a quarter, no walls, no laws, no privileges will guard our security.
