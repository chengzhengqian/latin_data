<p>XIII. There is no point, I think, that I have passed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span>
over, but there is something that I have reserved for the end of my speech. The object of this “something” is that my words may completely reconcile you with Deiotarus. Not that I fear any longer that you cherish a grievance against him; I rather fear lest you should suspect that <span class="italic">he</span> cherishes some grievance against <span class="italic">you.</span> But believe me, Caesar, nothing is farther from the truth. He remembers what you have helped him to retain, not what you have helped him to lose; he does not consider that you have inflicted a penalty on him, but, since you thought that there was much that you must bestow on many of your supporters, he has not objected to your taking it from him who was your opponent.

the Great, king of Asia, when after his defeat<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_535_a" id="target_note_LCL252_535_a"><sup>a</sup></a> at the hands of Lucius Scipio he was compelled to recognize the Taurus as the limit of his realm, and had forfeited all that territory which is to-day our province of Asia, commonly asserted that he had been kindly treated by the Roman people, in that he had been released from a too extensive jurisdiction and his kingdom reduced to reasonable proportions. Deiotarus has far better reason to console himself than had he; for Antiochus had borne the penalty of madness, Deiotarus of a mistake. Full payment, Caesar, was made by you to Deiotarus, when you allowed the kingly title to himself and to his son. That title maintained and assured to him, he thinks that the kindness of the Roman people and the opinion held of him by the Senate has been no whit diminished. Proud and erect of heart he stands, nor shall he ever bow to his foes—no, nor yet to fortune. He deems himself to have earned by his past actions<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">37</span><span class="br"></span>
