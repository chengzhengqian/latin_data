To meet this naval equipment Archimedes disposed artillery of different sizes on the walls. Against ships at a distance he kept discharging stones of great weight; nearer vessels he would attack with lighter and all the more numerous missile weapons. Finally, that his own men might discharge their bolts at the enemy without exposure to wounds, he opened the wall from bottom to top with numerous loopholes about a cubit wide,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_285_1" id="target_note_LCL355_285_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and through these some, without being seen, shot at the enemy with arrows, others from small scorpions. As for the ships which came closer, in order to be inside the range of his artillery, against these an iron grapnel, fastened to a stout chain, would be thrown on to the bow by means of a swing-beam projecting over the wall. When this<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_285_2" id="target_note_LCL355_285_2"><sup>2</sup></a> sprung backward to the ground owing to the shifting of a heavy leaden weight, it would set the ship on its stem, bow in air.
