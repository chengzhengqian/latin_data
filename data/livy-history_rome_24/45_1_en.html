agreement and fearing an uprising, they declared <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 214</span>Epicydes and Hippocrates magistrates. And at first the newly elected did not reveal their intentions, although they were indignant that legates had gone to Appius Claudius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_263_1" id="target_note_LCL355_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to sue for a ten days’ truce, and that, this being secured, others had been sent to negotiate the renewal of the old treaty. At that time the Roman commander had a fleet of a hundred ships off Murgantia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL355_263_2" id="target_note_LCL355_263_2"><sup>2</sup></a> waiting to see what would be the outcome of the disturbances at Syracuse due to the massacre of the tyrant’s family, and to what the new and unwonted freedom would prompt them.</p>
<p>About the same time Marcellus was just arriving in Sicily, and the Syracusan ambassadors were sent to him by Appius. After hearing the peace terms, Marcellus thought agreement could be reached, and himself sent ambassadors to Syracuse to treat in person with the magistrates for a renewal of the treaty.

But from the time Appius began to keep ships at anchor at the harbour mouth in order to encourage the men of the other party, the false charges apparently had received strong confirmation. And at first the crowd had even rushed down in disorder to keep them off in case they should be landing.</p>
