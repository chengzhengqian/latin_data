<p>11. (17) And I contemplated the other, lower, things, and perceived that they are neither completely existent nor completely nonexistent: they do exist because they are from you, but they do not exist because they are not what you are: that is, what really abides unchangingly. Yet it is good for me to cleave to God<span class="marginNote right">Ps 73:28</span>, because if I do not abide in him I cannot abide in myself<span class="marginNote right">Ws 7:27; Rv 21:5</span>. Abiding in himself, however, he makes all things new; and you are my God, for you need no goods of mine<span class="marginNote right">Ps 16:2</span>.</p>
<p>12. (18) It was also made apparent to me that the things that are perishable<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_331_42" id="target_note_LCL026_331_42"><sup>42</sup></a> are still good because it would be impossible for them to become perishable if they were either a supreme good or were not good at all. For if they were a supreme good, they would be imperishable, but if they were not a good at all there would be nothing in them with the capacity to be perishable. For perishability entails change to a worse state, and such change could not be inflicted without diminishing what was once good. So either perishability entails no change for the worse, which is impossible, or (which is beyond dispute) all things that are perishable are deprived of some good. But if things are deprived of good completely, they will altogether cease to exist. For if they go on existing but are no longer perishable they will be in a better state because they will abide enduringly and imperishably. And what could be more unnatural than to declare that the loss of all good has made those things better? Therefore, if they are to be deprived of all good they will cease to exist altogether; therefore, for as long as they do exist, they are good. Therefore, whatever they are, they are good: and evil itself, whose source I kept trying to discover, has no physical existence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_331_43" id="target_note_LCL026_331_43"><sup>43</sup></a> because if it did have physical existence it would have to
