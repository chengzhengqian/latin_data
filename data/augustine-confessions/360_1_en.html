<p>22. (31) Perhaps someone may try to dispute with the last two of these opinions as follows: “If you do not want this shapelessness of matter to be called ‘heaven’ and ‘earth,’ there must have been something that God had not made, something from which he made heaven and earth. Scripture has not recorded that God made this primal matter, unless we understand the terms ‘heaven and earth’ or just ‘earth’ as a reference to it, when it was said, ‘in the beginning God made heaven and earth.’ In that case although it was convenient to describe what comes next (‘the earth was invisible and unstructured’) as shapeless matter, we should understand it only as what God made it in the previous phrase, ‘he made heaven and earth.’” The people who have put forward those last two interpretations that we posed (either one or the other) will hear the objections and say, “we do not deny that the <span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:31</span>shapeless matter was made by God, God from whom comes all that is very good; because just as we declare that things that are created and have shape are more good, so too we must concede that what is merely capable of being created and given shape is less good, but still there is an element of goodness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_307_56" id="target_note_LCL027_307_56"><sup>56</sup></a> True, scripture does not record that God made shapelessness, but then there are many other things it does not record, such as the cherubim<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_307_57" id="target_note_LCL027_307_57"><sup>57</sup></a> and seraphim,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_307_58" id="target_note_LCL027_307_58"><sup>58</sup></a> and what the apostle clearly stated, <span class="marginNote right">Col 1:16</span>‘throne, dominations, principalities, authorities,’ and yet it is obvious that God made them all.</p>
