 As I lay in bed alone I called to mind those verses of your servant Ambrose, which spoke truly: for you are,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">O God, the maker of all things,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">You rule the heavens, and you clothe</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The day with light magnificent,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The night with drowsy-making grace:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">So that a time of ease restores</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Our rested limbs to do their work,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Lightens the cares of wearied minds,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And frees our anxious hearts from grief.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_61_93" id="target_note_LCL027_61_93"><sup>93</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>(33) From then on, little by little I began to restore your handmaid to the way I had formerly thought about her; and likewise her behavior, which was devout toward you and dutifully pleasing and compliant toward us. Of all this I had been deprived at a stroke, and it was a comfort to weep about her and for her, about myself and for myself, in your presence. I let flow my tears, which I had until that moment restrained, and let them fall as freely as they would. I made them a bed to rest my heart upon; and it did find rest on them, since my sobs were for your ears only, not for any harsh interpreter to hear. Now, Lord, I make my confession to you in writing. Let anyone read it who will, let them interpret as they will. If they do find fault, let them not be scornful because I wept so briefly for my mother, a mother who was, at least for the present, dead to my sightâ€”and who had wept over me for so many years in the hope that I would come to live in your sight. Instead, if they are rich in charity let them offer a lament themselves for my sins, to you, O Father of all who are brothers of your Christ.</p>
