Because I could not see these in my mind I thought I was unable to see the mind itself. I loved the peace that is found in virtue, so likewise I hated the discord that attaches to vice. In the one I remarked its unity, in the other a kind of disunity. It seemed to me as if rational thought, and the nature of truth and of the supreme good, consisted in that unity; pitiable as I was, I imagined that some kind of concrete reality of irrational life, and the nature of ultimate evil, existed in that disunity—indeed it was not only a concrete reality but was altogether a living being.
