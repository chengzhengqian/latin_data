darkness, which the Manichaeans generally set up as an opposing force, what could it do to you if you were unwilling to contend against it? For if the response was, “That realm would have done you some harm,” you would be vulnerable and perishable. But if it was admitted that it could not have inflicted any harm, there was no justification to be offered for clashing with it, and clashing in such a way that one part of you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_299_11" id="target_note_LCL026_299_11"><sup>11</sup></a> and one limb, or offshoot from your own substance, would be mingled with enemy powers and natures not created by you; and in the end that part of you would be corrupted and mutated into something worse, and in such a way as to be transformed from felicity to wretchedness, while lacking any means of help by which it could be plucked out and purified.
