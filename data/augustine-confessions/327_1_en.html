moved, I can measure in time how long it moves for, from the time it begins to move until the time it stops. If I did not see when it started to move, and it keeps on moving but without letting me see when it stops, I do not have the means to make any measurement except perhaps the time from when I start to watch until I stop watching. But if I watch it for a long time, I can only report that it was a long time, not how long it was: this is because when we say how long something is, we are making that statement in the form of a comparison, “This is as long as that,” or, “this is twice the size of that,” and so on with matters of this kind. But if we could mark the distances between points in space, where a physical object has come from, and where it is headed (or when certain parts move, such as on a lathe), then we can say how long it takes for the movement of a physical object or its constituent parts from one point to the next to be completed. So because the movement of a physical object is one thing, and our means of measuring it is something else, who can be unaware which of these two phenomena is more properly described as time? For if the physical object were sometimes mobile, and at other times stationary, then we still measure not only its movement but also its immobility in terms of time, and say, “it was immobile for the same length of time as it was stationary,” or, “it was stationary for twice or three times as long as it was mobile”; or whatever else our measuring has expressed or estimated, as people commonly say, “more or less.” Time is not, therefore, the movement of a physical object.</p>
