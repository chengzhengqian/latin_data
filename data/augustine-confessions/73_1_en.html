disappointed. I hated everything because he was missing from everything, and there was nothing to say to me any longer: “Look—he is going to come!” as they had done when he was alive but not present. I had become the subject of my own questioning, and I challenged my soul as to why it was sad<span class="marginNote right">Ps 42:5</span>, and why it kept disquieting me so much: but it had no idea how to reply to me. And if I used to say, “Hope in God,”<span class="marginNote right">Ps 42:5</span> my soul would not obey me, and rightly so, because the human being whom I had lost when he was so very dear to me was truer and better than the imaginary divinity<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_147_21" id="target_note_LCL026_147_21"><sup>21</sup></a> in which I kept being told to put my hope.
