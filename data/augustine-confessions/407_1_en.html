“multiplicity”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_401_91" id="target_note_LCL027_401_91"><sup>91</sup></a> in both spiritual and physical beings (corresponding to heaven and earth); and in righteous and unrighteous minds (corresponding to light and darkness); and in holy authorities who were ministers of the law (corresponding to the firmament which was established between the waters); and in the company of peoples in bitter alienation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_401_92" id="target_note_LCL027_401_92"><sup>92</sup></a> (corresponding to the sea); and in the zeal of faithful souls (corresponding to the dry land); and in the actions of mercy according to this present life (corresponding to the seed-bearing plants and fruit-bearing trees); <span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 12:7</span>and in the spiritual gifts revealed in order to do good (corresponding to the sun and moon in the sky); and in emotions directed toward self-control (corresponding to the living soul).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_401_93" id="target_note_LCL027_401_93"><sup>93</sup></a> In all these things we find multiplicity and fertility and increase. But when it comes to what increases and multiplies in such a way that one thing can be stated in many ways, and one statement can be understood in many ways, we have not found this except in signs given physical form and in conceptions open to intellectual interpretation. We have interpreted these “signs given physical form” to be the reproductive fecundity of the waters, caused by the coercive drives of physical desire; whereas we understand “conceptions open to intellectual interpretation” to mean human reproductive fecundity, caused by the fertility of our reasoning mind. So we believed that you spoke, Lord, to both kinds when you said, “increase and multiply.” In this blessing that you granted to us, I accept the ability and the power you have given us both to state in various ways what we have held to be understood intellectually
