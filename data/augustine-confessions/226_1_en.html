<p>Just as friends can lead those who admire them astray, so enemies who quarrel can often set matters straight again. You reward them, though, not according to what you have brought about through them, but according to their intentions. In a temper, that maidservant had tried to provoke her young mistress, not to heal her: and she did so covertly, either because the quarrel had begun at a time and place when they were alone, or because she did not want to incriminate herself for being so late in reporting the matter. But you, Lord, rule over heavenly and earthly creatures, you convert to your purposes the depths of that flowing river,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_39_61" id="target_note_LCL027_39_61"><sup>61</sup></a> the unruly cascade of the years in their proper course:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_39_62" id="target_note_LCL027_39_62"><sup>62</sup></a> you even used the sickness of one woman’s soul to heal another’s.

When she was old enough to be ready for marriage she was given to a husband and served him <span class="marginNote right">Eph 5:21</span>“as her lord,” doing her best to win him for you, speaking to him of you as befitted her character. By this you made her attractive; to her husband she was respectful, with a loving nature, and deserved his admiration. She put up with marital infidelities, because she did not want any acrimony with her husband on such a topic. She was waiting for your mercy to come upon him so that he would turn to you and reform his adulterous ways. Besides this, he was a distinctly generous man, but quick-tempered too. She knew she must not oppose him when he was angry, not by action, not even by a word.
