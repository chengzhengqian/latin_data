<p>In the morning I shall stand before him, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 43:5</span>and I shall behold the salvation of my countenance,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_363_43" id="target_note_LCL027_363_43"><sup>43</sup></a> that is, my God; <span class="marginNote right">Rom 8:11</span>and he will bring life to our mortal bodies by the Spirit who dwells in us, because in its mercy it moved over the darksome flux which is our inner selves. As a result, <span class="marginNote right">2 Cor 1:22, 5:5</span>on our pilgrim journey we have received a pledge that we are now light, <span class="marginNote right">Rom 8:24</span>while as yet we have been saved in hope, and are children of light, and children of the day, <span class="marginNote right">1 Thes 5:5</span>not children of night and shadow, as we were before. You alone distinguish between the children of darkness and us, since the state of human knowledge is still so unreliable; you delve into our hearts, and you call the light “day” and the shadows, “night.” After all, who can judge between us if not you? <span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 4:7</span>What do we possess which is not your gift—<span class="marginNote right">Rom 9:21</span>vessels for honorable use from the same lump of clay from which other vessels are also formed, but for ignominious use?</p>
<p>15. (16) Again, who if not you, our God, <span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:7</span>made for us an authoritative firmament<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_363_44" id="target_note_LCL027_363_44"><sup>44</sup></a> above us in the form of your holy Scripture? <span class="marginNote right">Is 34:4</span>For heaven will be rolled up like a book, though now it is <span class="marginNote right">Ps 104:2</span>stretched out above us like a skin. Your holy Scripture has a higher authority, since those mortals you used as channels for bestowing it on us have submitted to death. <span class="marginNote right">Jn 21:15-17<span class="linebreak"></span>Gn 3:21</span>And you know, Lord, you know<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_363_45" id="target_note_LCL027_363_45"><sup>45</sup></a> how you have clothed humanity in skins when—by reason of their sin—they became subject to death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_363_46a" id="target_note_LCL027_363_46a"><sup>46</sup></a> So, like a skin, you stretched out the firmament that is your book, your words to us that are in perfect concord, which you have set in authority over us through the ministry of mortal beings.
