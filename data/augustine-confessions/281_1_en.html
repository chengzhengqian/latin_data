the person who eats must not reject the one who does not, while that the person who does not eat must not judge the one who does. This I have learned—thanks be to you, my God, and praises to you, my teacher, for you have knocked at the door of my ears, you have brought light into my heart. <span class="marginNote right">Ps 18:29</span>Carry me away from every temptation. It is not unclean food I fear, but rather unclean desires. I know that <span class="marginNote right">Gn 9:2-3</span>Noah was allowed to eat every kind of flesh that was suitable for food; that Elijah fortified himself with meat for food, that John was endowed with a remarkable control of his appetite, and was not made unclean<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_149_92" id="target_note_LCL027_149_92"><sup>92</sup></a> by the creatures—<span class="marginNote right">Mt 3:4</span>namely locusts—which became his food.
