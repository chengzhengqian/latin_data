and the perceptions of my other senses, and my body, whether it is well or unwell. When those things were present, my memory took impressions of themâ€”impressions which I scrutinized when they were present, and drew forth from my mind when I recalled them in their absence. So if forgetfulness really is stored in my memory in the form of an impression rather than the thing itself, there must definitely have been a time when it was present, so its impression could be taken. But when it was present, how did it etch an impression of itself on my memory, given that by its very presence forgetfulness obliterates even that which has already been recorded? And yet by some means or other, however unintelligible and mystifying that means may be, I am positive that I remember forgetfulness itself, which consigns whatever I remember to oblivion.</p>
<p>17. (26) O my God, what a powerful force memory is, something awe-inspiring, a deep and boundless complexity!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_113_54" id="target_note_LCL027_113_54"><sup>54</sup></a> And this is the mind, and this is what I am. And what is that, my God? What kind of nature am I? A complex and manifold life and one that is utterly incalculable. Look! In the fields and caves and hollows of my memory (which are countless, and teeming with countless things of countless kinds), whether by means of impressions (as of every kind of physical object) or of things actually present (such as everything which has been learned) or through ideas and perceptions (such as the emotions, which the memory preserves even when the mind is not experiencing them, since whatever is in the memory is in the mind): I crisscross between them and flit from one thing to another, I go as deep as I can, and I find there are no limits. That is how powerful a force memory is, a powerful life force in every living being born to die.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_113_55" id="target_note_LCL027_113_55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
