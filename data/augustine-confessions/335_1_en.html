<p>30. (40) <span class="marginNote right">Phil 4:1; 1 Thes 3:8</span>I shall stand fast and be established in you,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_257_84" id="target_note_LCL027_257_84"><sup>84</sup></a> in the pattern for my life, which is your truth. I shall not permit questions from people who endure sickness as their punishment and thirst for more than they can hold, and who say, “What was God doing before he made heaven and earth?” Or, “what came into his mind to prompt him to act, when before that he had done nothing?” Lord, let them consider carefully what they are saying; and discover that it is meaningless to say “never” when time does not exist. The fact that they say he never made anything, what does this mean if not that he did not make it at any time? So let them see that no time can exist without the act of creation, and then let them stop <span class="marginNote right">Ps 144:8<span class="linebreak"></span>Phil 3:13</span>talking vanity. Let them even reach out to what is before them, and understand that before all time existed you are the eternal creator of all time; and that no periods of time are coeternal with you, nor any act of creation, even if it takes place beyond any actual times.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_257_85" id="target_note_LCL027_257_85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p>31. (41) O Lord my God, what is that shelter of your innermost mystery? <span class="marginNote right">Ps 51:11</span>And how far away from it have the consequences of my sins driven me? Heal my eyes so that I can share in the joy of your light! To be sure, if there exists a mind so strong in sublime knowledge and foreknowledge that is as familiar with all things past and future as I am with a well-known hymn,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_257_86" id="target_note_LCL027_257_86"><sup>86</sup></a> that mind is extraordinary and remarkable, and awe-inspiring. This is particularly true given that nothing in past history and nothing in the future ages is obscure to it; in the same way as nothing is obscure to me when I sing that hymn—what proportion of it has passed since its beginning, and what proportion of it yet remains before it is ended.</p>
