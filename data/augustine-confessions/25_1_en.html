Men were set up as examples for me to imitate who would have been mortified if, when they were recounting some acts of theirs (acts not wrong in themselves), they had been criticized for mispronunciation or making a grammatical error.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_51_92" id="target_note_LCL026_51_92"><sup>92</sup></a> But if they gave full and elaborate descriptions of their immoral behavior in rounded and well-constructed phraseology, they boasted of the praise they won for it!
