 nothing, bringing and filling and protecting, creating and nurturing and bringing to perfection, seeking even though you lack nothing. You love, yet do not burn with passion; you are zealous in your love and yet peaceable; you repent without regretting<span class="marginNote right">Gn 6:6–7</span>; you are angry yet serene; you change your works yet do not change your purpose; you accept what you find and have never lost. You are never poor and you take pleasure in gain; you are never greedy yet you exact interest<span class="marginNote right">Mt 25:14–30<span class="linebreak"></span>Lk 10:35</span>; you receive more in payment than you ask for<span class="marginNote right"></span> so as to put you under an obligation—yet who owns anything that is not, in reality, yours? You pay off debts, though you owe nothing to anyone; you remit debts, yet suffer no loss. After all this, what have we said, my God, my life, my holy sweetness?

What am I myself to you, that you insist on my loving you—and, unless I do so, you are angry with me and threaten me with great unhappiness? Is my unhappiness insignificant if I do not love you? Pity me! Tell me, O Lord my God, by your mercies, what you are to me. Say to my soul, “I am your salvation”:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_9_12" id="target_note_LCL026_9_12"><sup>12</sup></a><span class="marginNote right">Ps 35:3</span> speak in such a way that I may hear. Look—the ears of my heart are before you, Lord. Open them and say to my soul, “I am your salvation.” I shall run after this voice and embrace you. Do not hide your face from me<span class="marginNote right">Pss 27:9, 143:7</span>: let me die—in order not to die—so that I may see it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_9_13" id="target_note_LCL026_9_13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
