death of his flesh was in fact true, the more false was the life of my soul, because it did not believe in it.</p>
<p>As my fever worsened, I was on the point of departing and dispersing. Where would I go, then, if I left this place, but into the fiery torments that my deeds deserved, according to the truth of your ordinance? She<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_215_39" id="target_note_LCL026_215_39"><sup>39</sup></a> did not know about it, yet kept on praying for me though I was not with her. You are present everywhere, so where she was, your heard her, and where I was, you took pity on me. So I recovered my bodily health, though my idolatrous<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_215_40" id="target_note_LCL026_215_40"><sup>40</sup></a> heart was still sick.

I cannot adequately express what were her feelings toward me, and how much more she struggled to give me spiritual birth than when she had given birth to me physically.</p>
<p>(17) So I cannot see how she could have recovered if my death in such a fashion had pierced through the visceral<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_215_43" id="target_note_LCL026_215_43"><sup>43</sup></a> nature of her love. And where would her urgent prayers be then, so frequent, so unceasing? Nowhere, if not with you. God of mercies, would you really have rejected the contrite, lowly heart<span class="marginNote right">Ps 51:17</span> of a modest and sober widow<span class="marginNote right">1 Tm 3:11, 5:10</span>? someone busy with acts of charity, obedient in serving your saints, not for a single day neglecting the offering at your altar,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_215_44" id="target_note_LCL026_215_44"><sup>44</sup></a> twice daily, morning and evening,
