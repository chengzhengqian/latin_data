All this physical world (which is not completely everywhere) has been given a beautiful appearance in its furthermost parts: the foundation of this is our earth; but the heaven that belongs to our earth counts as mere earth in comparison with that heaven of heavens. And both of these great physical entities quite reasonably count as earth in comparison with that inconceivable heaven which belongs to the Lord, not to the children of men.</p>
<p>3. (3) Undoubtedly this earth was <span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:1</span>invisible and lacking all structure, an unfathomably deep abyss. Above it there was no light because light had not yet any visible form:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_263_3a" id="target_note_LCL027_263_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> this is why you caused it to be written, <span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:2</span>“above the abyss was darkness.” What is darkness if not the absence of light? For if light had existed, where would it have been if not on high, conspicuous and shining forth? So when light did not yet exist, surely the presence of darkness was simply the absence of light? So darkness was above it because there was no light above it; just as when there is no sound, there is silence. And what does silence in a place consist of, if not the absence of sound from that place? Surely you, Lord, have taught this soul which makes confession to you?—surely you, Lord, have taught me that before you gave shape and distinct identity to that formless material, there was nothing—no color, no shape, no body, no spirit? Even so it was not completely nothing: <span class="marginNote right">cf. Ws 11:17</span>there was a certain shapelessness, without definite form.</p>
