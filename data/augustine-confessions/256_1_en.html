(18) For this reason, we find that learning the kind of things that we do not absorb as impressions by our sense perceptions, but rather discern deep within in themselves exactly as they are, instead of by means of impressions: this is nothing other than using our thought processes to bind together things that our memory contains in a random disorder, and by taking careful note to ensure that they be placed ready to hand in that same memory where once they lay neglected, scattered and ignored, so that they now present themselves easily for ready application. My memory possesses so many things like this: things which have already been found and, as I said, placed ready to hand (as it were)—and we are said to have learned and come to know these things. If I fail to recall things after a limited space of time, they sink back down and slip away into the farther corners: then they must be thought through once more afresh as if completely new (for they have nowhere else to go). Then they must be gathered up again so that they can be known: that is, out of their diffusion they must be bound together: from this comes the term “cogitate.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_99_41" id="target_note_LCL027_99_41"><sup>41</sup></a> For it is just the same with <span class="italic">cogo</span> and <span class="italic">cogito,</span> as <span class="italic">ago</span> and <span class="italic">agito,</span> <span class="italic">facio</span> and <span class="italic">factito.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_99_42a" id="target_note_LCL027_99_42a"><sup>42</sup></a> The mind, however, has laid
