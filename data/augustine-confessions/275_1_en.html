experience no more pain and toil, and my whole life will be alive, because it is filled with you. But now (given that anyone you fill, you raise up) I am a burden to myself, because I am not filled with you. Joys I ought to weep over are at war with sorrows that I should rejoice in: and which side will gain the victory I have no idea.
