(8) The heaven of heaven<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_271_13" id="target_note_LCL027_271_13"><sup>13</sup></a> belongs to you, O Lord: but the earth, which you have given to the children of men to look upon it and touch it, was not the same as what we now look upon and touch. It was invisible and without structure, an abyss over which no light existed; or there was darkness above the abyss, in other words a darkness more profound than the abyss itself.
