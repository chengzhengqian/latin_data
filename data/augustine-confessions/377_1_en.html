 of you the good of existing. And what about the beginning of the spiritual creation? Did it deserve from you at least a state of flux in darkness like the abyss, and unlike you?—unless it was converted by the same Word to the one who made it; and was enlightened by him, and became a light itself <span class="marginNote right">Phil 2:6; Rom 8:29</span>(although not equal, nonetheless still conformed to that form which is equal with you). Just as, for a body, being is not the same as being beautiful (otherwise being ugly would be impossible) so too for a created spirit living is not the same as living wisely (otherwise it would be immutably wise). But for such a being it is good to cleave to you constantly, so that it does not lose, by backsliding, the light that it has gained by conversion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_341_6" id="target_note_LCL027_341_6"><sup>6</sup></a> reverting to a life like the shadowy abyss. Even we who are a spiritual creation in respect of our souls, have turned away from you, <span class="marginNote right">Jn 8:12</span>our Light; and in that previous life we have been sometimes <span class="marginNote right">Eph 5:8</span>shadows toiling in the remnants of our own darkness, until, in your only Son, <span class="marginNote right">2 Cor 5:21</span>we become your righteousness like the mountains of God: for once we were <span class="marginNote right">Ps 36:6</span>your judgments, like the great abyss.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_341_7" id="target_note_LCL027_341_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>3. (4) I think it is not inappropriate to your spiritual creation, that declaration of yours in the first moments of creation, <span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:3</span>“let there be light, and there was light.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_341_8" id="target_note_LCL027_341_8"><sup>8</sup></a> For there was already a certain kind of life, for you to enlighten. But just as it did not deserve from you the kind of life that could receive enlightenment, neither—now that it had such a life—did it deserve from you such enlightenment.
