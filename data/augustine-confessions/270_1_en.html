 I rejoice in! There is a kind of enjoyment not granted to the godless but only to those who worship you of their own free will, namely the people for whom you yourself are their joy. And that is the real “blessed life”—rejoicing toward you, about you, because of you. It is the real joy, and there is no other. Anyone who thinks there is another kind is really pursuing a different kind of enjoyment, not true enjoyment itself. At least their will is not turned away from any kind of impression of enjoyment.</p>
<p>23. (33) It is not certain, then, that everyone wants to be blessed, because anyone who does not want to find enjoyment in you (which is the only blessed life) certainly does not desire that blessed life.

Everyone wants this blessed life, the only kind of life that is blessed—everyone wants it. And everyone wants the enjoyment of truth.
