 lacking structure, lacking light. Someone else takes “but the earth was invisible and unstructured, and there was darkness over the abyss” to mean that the entirety of what is called heaven and earth was still dark and unshaped matter, and from it the physical heaven and physical earth together with all the physical entities that they contain would become perceptible to the senses. Another person takes “but the earth was invisible and unstructured, and there was darkness over the abyss” to mean that that the entirety of what is called heaven and earth was still dark and unshaped matter, and from it emerged the rational heaven (what is referred to elsewhere as the “heaven of heavens”) and the earth consisting of all nature that is physical (a description which is also understood to include this physical heaven)—this is what the whole creation, visible and invisible consists in. Yet another takes “but the earth was invisible and unstructured, and there was darkness over the abyss” like this: scripture did not call that shapelessness of matter by the names “heaven” and “earth”; but, they say, the actual shapelessness that it called “earth invisible and unstructured and the dark abyss” already existed. Out of this shapelessness scripture had already said that God made heaven and earth, which undoubtedly means the spiritual and physical creation. Another takes “but the earth was invisible and unstructured, and there was darkness over the abyss” to mean that the shapelessness was already a kind of physical matter from which scripture had just said that God made heaven and earth, and this was certainly the entire physical mass of the world, divided into two immense sectors, an upper and a lower, together with all the familiar and well-known creatures which they contain.</p>
