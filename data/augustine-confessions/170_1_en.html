 that the unchangeable is preferable to the changeable, what was the source of its knowing the concept of unchangingness? For if it did not know it by some means, it could not by any means be sure in preferring it to what is changeable. And with the stroke of one trembling glance<span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 15:52</span> it arrived at that which truly is.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_341_50" id="target_note_LCL026_341_50"><sup>50</sup></a> Then in truth I perceived that your invisible nature is understood by means of your creation<span class="marginNote right">Rom 1:20</span>, but I had not the strength to fix my gaze; instead my weakness rebounded<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_341_51" id="target_note_LCL026_341_51"><sup>51</sup></a> and I was returned to my old habits, carrying with me no more than a loving memory and, as it were, longing to smell the sweet savor of food that I could not as yet consume.</p>
