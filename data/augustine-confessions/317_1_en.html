present,” because when it was present, it was long. It had not yet passed away into nonexistence, and so there was something existent that was capable of being long. But after it passed away, all at once it ceased to be long because it ceased to exist at all.</p>
<p>(19) Now, O human soul, let us see whether present time can be long, for it is given to you to be sensitive to moments of time and to measure them. Who will reply to me? Is the current century a long time? First, consider whether a century can be “present.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_221_45" id="target_note_LCL027_221_45"><sup>45</sup></a> If the first of those years is running its course, it is itself present, but the other ninety-nine are in the future: so they do not yet exist. But if the second year is under way, one year is already in the past, and a second is in the present, and all the rest are yet to be. Likewise we can posit any intervening year from this total of a century as the present. Before it are the years past; after it are those in the future. For this reason one hundred years cannot all be in the present. At least consider whether the one year that is currently running its course is itself present. If its first month is running its course, the rest are in the future; if the second, then the first has already passed away, and the rest are not yet in being. So the year is not wholly present either as it runs its course; and if it is not wholly present, the year itself is not present. For a year consists of twelve months; and whichever one of its twelve months is running its course is itself present, but the rest are either past or future. Still, neither the month which is running its course is present but only a single day of it: if the first day, then all the rest are in the future, if the last, then all the rest are in the past, if some day in the middle, then it is between days past and days in the future.</p>
