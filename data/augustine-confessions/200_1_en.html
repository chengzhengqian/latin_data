<p>(24) Therefore when they perceive two opposing wills in a single person, they should no longer say that two contrary minds from two contrary substances and from two contrary origins are in conflict, and that one is good, the other evil. For you, God of truth<span class="marginNote right">Jn 3:33</span>, condemn those people, and confound and conquer them. For instance, in a case when both wills are evil: when someone chooses whether to kill another person with poison or a weapon; whether to usurp one portion or another of someone’s estate (assuming that usurping both is impossible); or whether to buy pleasure through extravagance or hoard money out of greed; whether to go to the circus or to the theater if there are shows on at both on the same day.
