came from. I had my back to the light,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_181_74" id="target_note_LCL026_181_74"><sup>74</sup></a> and my face to those things that are illuminated; so my face, by which I saw those things illuminated, was not itself illuminated.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_181_75" id="target_note_LCL026_181_75"><sup>75</sup></a> Whatever I read on the art of public speaking and argument, on geometry and music and arithmetic I understood without difficulty and without anyone to explain it to me.</p>
<p>You know this, O Lord my God, for swift intelligence and keen discernment are your gift. But they did not prompt me to offer sacrifice to you; and so they were no use to me but rather contributed to my downfall. After all, I had my hands full getting control of such a large portion of my substance<span class="marginNote right">Lk 15:13</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_181_76" id="target_note_LCL026_181_76"><sup>76</sup></a> and I was not preserving my strength for you<span class="marginNote right">Ps 59:9</span>. Instead I was going away from you, into a far country, to fritter it away on shameless desires. What good was my ability when I made no proper use of it? For I did not feel that those arts were particularly difficult for people who are hardworking and intelligent to understand, until I started trying to explain those same ideas to them; then the person who was least slow to understand my explanation was the one who most excelled in those arts.</p>
<p>(31) What good did it do me, to think that you, O Lord God, O Truth, were an unfathomable, luminous body, and I a particle of that body? What extraordinary heresy! But that is how I was, and I do not blush, O my God, to confess to you your mercies toward me, and to call upon you; after all, I did not blush then to publish my blasphemies to everyone and to rant at you<span class="marginNote right">Jdt 11:19</span>. What good was my intelligence to me, made so nimble by those doctrines; and all those complicated books disentangled without the help of any human tuition; when I was abandoning the teachings of the faith with my corrupt and scandalous immorality?
