 by people judging from limited experience, basing their judgment upon human standards<span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 4:3</span> and sizing up the universal customs of the human race according to their own practice. They are like someone in an armory who is ignorant of what armor fits what part of the body, and wants his head covered with a greave, and a helmet put on his feet, and then grumbles because they do not fit properly; or like someone, on a day when commerce is forbidden in the afternoon, becoming dyspeptic at not being allowed to set out goods for sale, because in the morning it had been permitted; or like seeing something being handled in a house by some slave or other which even the butler is not allowed to do; or something going on behind the stable that is not allowed at dinner, and then being angry that what goes for one dwelling and one household is not equally enjoined upon each and everyone alike.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_115_40" id="target_note_LCL026_115_40"><sup>40</sup></a> So it is with those who become angry when they hear of something that was permissible for righteous people in former times but that in their own time is forbidden to righteous people. This is because God has directed them to do one thing and those others to do something different, according to the requirements of particular times, although both sets of people are submitting to the same standard of righteousness, when in the case of one person, on one day, in one household, they see different things appropriate to different groups of people; or something else allowed a short time ago but after a certain time forbidden; or something being permissible or compulsory in one corner which in the corner next to it is forbidden and sanctioned. Surely righteousness is not therefore inconstant and changeable?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_115_41" id="target_note_LCL026_115_41"><sup>41</sup></a> But the times over which righteousness presides do not proceed equally: they are, after all, temporal.
