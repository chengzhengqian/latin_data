<h2><span class="ac">BOOK XI</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">1. (1) Because eternity is yours, Lord, can you be unaware of what I am telling you? Can you be within time when you see what happens in time? So why am I regaling you in this way with so many stories about what happened? It is certainly not so that I can make you aware of these events. On the contrary, I stimulate my own feelings, and those of my readers, toward you, so that we can all declare, <span class="marginNote right">Pss 48:1, 96:4, 145:3</span>“great is the Lord and surpassingly worthy of praise.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_191_1" id="target_note_LCL027_191_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I have said this already, and I shall go on saying it: “I do this because of my love for your love.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_191_2" id="target_note_LCL027_191_2"><sup>2</sup></a> After all, in the same way we pray, even though Truth tells us, <span class="marginNote right">Mt 6:8</span>“Your Father knows what you need, before you ask it of him.” So we reveal our feelings toward you by confessing to you our pitiable condition, and <span class="marginNote right">Ps 33:22</span>your mercies bestowed upon us, so that you complete in us the deliverance you have begun. Thus we shall cease to be pitiable in ourselves, and will become blessed in you, for you have called us <span class="marginNote right">Mt 5:3-9</span>to be poor in spirit, and gentle, and sorrowing, and hungry and thirsty for righteousness, and merciful, and pure in heart, and peacemakers. Look! What a lot of things I have told you—what I was capable of and what I wanted—because even before that you wanted me to make my confession to you, Lord my God, because you are good, because <span class="marginNote right">Ps 118:1</span>your mercy is eternal.</p>
