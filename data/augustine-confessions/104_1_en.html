They would not go brazenly bursting at random into the school of a person who was not even their teacher: they would not even be allowed in unless the teacher gave permission.</p>
<p>It was quite the opposite at Carthage, where the students showed a disgracefully extreme lack of restraint. They blatantly invade and, in almost a frenzy of recklessness, turn to uproar the order which the teacher has imposed for the benefit of the pupils. With extraordinary stupidity they commit their manifold outrages, which would be punishable by law but for the protection of custom. This shows that they are more pitiable insofar as they behave that way as if it were authorized, but it will never be so according to your eternal law. They think that they can act with impunity, although the very blindness of their actions is their punishment, and they suffer immeasurably worse things than they inflict.
