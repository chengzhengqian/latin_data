just as wide a distance between them as if I were seeing them externally. Even so, when I looked at them with my eyes, I did now absorb them into myself by the act of looking at them, and it is not they themselves that abide with me, but impressions of them; and I know which impression was made upon me by which physical sense.</p>
<p>9. (16) The limitless capacity of my memory, though, holds more things than just these. Here too is everything not yet forgotten from what I learned of the liberal arts,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_95_34" id="target_note_LCL027_95_34"><sup>34</sup></a> in some interior place which is not a real physical place at all. In this case I am dealing with the phenomena themselves, not mere impressions of them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_95_35" id="target_note_LCL027_95_35"><sup>35</sup></a> For whatever I know of what literature is, and skill in public speaking, and different types of inquiries, and the like, it stays in my memory in such a way that it is no mere impression I keep while leaving the realities external to myself. It is not like a voice that makes a sound and then passes away, a voice imprinted through my ears by that trace of sound that makes remembering it possible (as if it were still sounding after it had really ceased to sound).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_95_36" id="target_note_LCL027_95_36"><sup>36</sup></a> Nor is it like a scent, which, while it passes and vanishes into the winds, has an impact on our sense of smell, and transmits an impression of itself into our memory that we can renew when we reflect back on it. Nor is it like food which, once in the stomach, can no longer be tasted, though in the memory taste of a kind remains. Nor is it like something that one feels by physical touch, which can be reimagined in the memory even when it is taken away from us. Indeed such physical sensations have no way in to the memory, but simple impressions of them are taken, with remarkable speed; and they are stored away in remarkable caches, and from there, by being called to remembrance, they are retrieved in a remarkable manner.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_95_37" id="target_note_LCL027_95_37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
