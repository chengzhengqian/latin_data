<p>Some people, when they read or hear these words of scripture, think of God as some kind of human being, or some other colossal authority, endowed with new power, which made a sudden and unexpected decision to make heaven and earth outside of itself, as if in regions distant from itself—two vast bodies, one below and one above, containing all that is. Then when they hear, “God spoke: let such and such be made: and it was made,” they think of his words as begun and ended, sounding and passing away in time; and after their passing, what had been commanded to exist immediately did exist, and so did anything else of this kind that they think of in earthly, physical<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_321_68" id="target_note_LCL027_321_68"><sup>68</sup></a> terms. <span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 3:1-3</span>Such worldly beings<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_321_69" id="target_note_LCL027_321_69"><sup>69</sup></a> are still in their infancy, while their weakness is nestled in the simplest kind of language as if brooded by their mother. But their faith is being built up in a healthy way, to help them grasp and hold firm the fact that God made all the natural phenomena, in their wondrous variety, which their sense perceptions see all around them. If any of them were to scorn the words of scripture as too humble, and to lean forward out of their nurturing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_321_70" id="target_note_LCL027_321_70"><sup>70</sup></a> nest in all the weakness of their pride,—alas! poor creatures, they will fall. Lord God, have mercy, do not let those passing on their way trample your chicks when they are still unfledged; send your angel to restore them to the nest, to live there till they fledge.</p>
