It was all pouring out from my eyes and my mouth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_19_30" id="target_note_LCL027_19_30"><sup>30</sup></a> when your good Spirit turned to us and said, “Sons of men, why are you so heavy-hearted? <span class="marginNote right">Ps 4:2</span>Why do you love vanity and pursue falsehood?” I certainly had loved vanity and pursued falsehood, and you, Lord, had already glorified your holy one,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_19_31" id="target_note_LCL027_19_31"><sup>31</sup></a> <span class="marginNote right">Eph 1:20</span>reviving him from the dead and setting him at your right hand—from where he could send forth <span class="marginNote right">Lk 24:49</span>from on high what you have promised: the Paraclete, the Spirit of truth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_19_32" id="target_note_LCL027_19_32"><sup>32</sup></a> Now he had sent him already, but I was unaware of it. He had sent him because he was already glorified, after the resurrection from the dead and ascension into heaven: <span class="marginNote right">Jn 7:39</span>before this, the Spirit had not been bestowed, because Jesus was not yet revealed in glory. So the prophecy cries aloud, “Why so heavy-hearted? <span class="marginNote right">Ps 4:2-3</span>Why do you love vanity and pursue falsehood? Be sure that the Lord has glorified his holy one.” It cries aloud “How long?” It cries aloud “Be sure!” And for so long in my ignorance I loved vanity and pursued falsehood, and now I have heard and trembled, because that prophecy is spoken to the kind of person I remember once having been myself. The phantasms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_19_33" id="target_note_LCL027_19_33"><sup>33</sup></a> that I had clung to instead of truth were nothing but vanity and falsehood. Loud and long was my lamenting at the grief of my recollections. If only those who still love vanity and pursue falsehood had heard me! They would have been profoundly disturbed and would have spewed it all out: and then you would have heard them when they cried out to you, <span class="marginNote right">Rom 5:9</span>because the one who died for us, who was truly dead according to the flesh,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_19_34" id="target_note_LCL027_19_34"><sup>34</sup></a> is the one who intercedes for us.</p>
