<p>And yet in your hearing, where none of them could listen, I reproached myself for the weakness of my feelings, and I restrained the flow of lamentation, and it receded a little. Then once more it attacked me with full force, not to the point of breaking into sobs, nor to a change in my outward expression—but I was aware of what feeling I was crushing in my heart. Also, because I was very disappointed that human concerns had such influence over me (for they must occur, as the duly appointed lot of our human condition) I grieved with a different sort of grief at the fact of my own grief,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_59_89" id="target_note_LCL027_59_89"><sup>89</sup></a> and I was torn apart by this twofold distress.</p>

Nor did we weep during those prayers that we poured forth to you when the sacrifice of our redemption was being offered for her<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_59_90" id="target_note_LCL027_59_90"><sup>90</sup></a> beside the tomb, where the body was laid prior to burial (this is the custom there). Not even during those prayers did I shed a tear. Yet all that day I was secretly crushed with grief, and in a turmoil of mind I asked you continually, as best I could, to heal my pain. You did not do so. I believe you were impressing it upon my memory by this single instance that the fetters of all habitual behavior have power even against a mind which is not nourished by deceitful words. It seemed to me that I ought to go to the baths, because I had heard that the noun “bath” derives from the Greeks calling it a “balanion” because it “casts out grief.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_59_91" id="target_note_LCL027_59_91"><sup>91</sup></a> Yes, I confess before your mercy, Father of the fatherless,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_59_92" id="target_note_LCL027_59_92"><sup>92</sup></a> that I bathed—and remained exactly as I had been before. For it did not wash away the bitterness of grief from my heart. But then I slept, and awoke, and discovered that my pain was markedly lessened.
