They act as judges, and they approve whatever they find to be right, and disapprove what is wrong: they do so either by celebrating the sacraments into which those whom <span class="marginNote right">Ps 18:16</span>your mercy searches out in the great waters are initiated;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_395_85" id="target_note_LCL027_395_85"><sup>85</sup></a> or by celebrating how that fish which was raised up from the deep is made manifest for the faithful earth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_395_86" id="target_note_LCL027_395_86"><sup>86</sup></a> to consume; or in the meanings and expressions of words under the authority of your book as the birds are under the firmament of heaven.
