things possess my soul! Let God possess it, who made these things, and surely made them good—but he himself is my Good, not them! All through the day, while I am awake, they affect me, I get no rest from them such as a solo voice provides,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_157_103" id="target_note_LCL027_157_103"><sup>103</sup></a> or sometimes the whole choir, when silence falls.
