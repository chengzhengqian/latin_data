that Aeneas at one time came to Carthage) the less well-educated will reply that they do not know, while those who are better educated will go so far as to say that it is untrue. But if I were to ask how to spell the name “Aeneas,” all those who have learned their letters will certainly reply according to that agreement and concordance by which people have defined those signs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_41_67" id="target_note_LCL026_41_67"><sup>67</sup></a> among themselves. Likewise, if I were to ask each of them what would cause the greater disruption to his life were he to forget it—either how to read and write, or those poetic fictions: surely anyone who has not completely lost his senses would see clearly what the reply must be?</p>

I suspect that Greek boys have the same reaction to Virgil, since they are made to learn him in the same way I learned Homer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_41_70" id="target_note_LCL026_41_70"><sup>70</sup></a> Evidently there is difficulty, real difficulty, in learning a foreign language at all, as if it sprinkled all the sweet flavor of the Greek mythical stories with a foul taste.
