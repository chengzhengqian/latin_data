Alypius decided to be reborn in you along with me: he was already <span class="marginNote right">Col 3:12</span>clothed with the humility that befits your sacraments, and <span class="marginNote right">cf. 1 Cor 9:27</span>exercised complete control over his body, even to the extent of walking barefoot over the chilly ground of Italy—an unheard-of enterprise!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_27_42" id="target_note_LCL027_27_42"><sup>42</sup></a> He and I added the boy Adeodatus to our number; he was the son I had begotten in my sin, according to the flesh. You had formed him well. He was nearly fifteen, and a quicker intelligence than many grave and learned men of mature years. O Lord my God, you are the creator of all things,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_27_43" id="target_note_LCL027_27_43"><sup>43</sup></a> and abound in power to reform our deformities:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_27_44" id="target_note_LCL027_27_44"><sup>44</sup></a> I confess to you your gifts, for apart from my act of sin, I had no part in that boy’s formation. As for the fact that we were bringing him up in the knowledge of you, you had inspired us to do so, you and none other. So I confess to you your gifts. There is a book of mine entitled, “On the Teacher”:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_27_45" id="target_note_LCL027_27_45"><sup>45</sup></a> in it Adeodatus has a conversation with me. You know that all the views introduced there in the character of my interlocutor are really his, when he was sixteen years old. I experienced many attributes of his that were even more remarkable: I was in awe of his intelligence. And who but you can be the craftsman of these amazing talents? You were quick to take his life from this earth, but I am not at all anxious when I remember him, for there is nothing for me to fear from his boyhood, or adolescence, and certainly not from his manhood.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_27_46" id="target_note_LCL027_27_46"><sup>46</sup></a> So we made him one of our company, for he was the same age as we were in terms of your grace,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_27_47" id="target_note_LCL027_27_47"><sup>47</sup></a> and he needed to be brought up according to your teaching.</p>
