of yours, a certain bishop<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_131_62" id="target_note_LCL026_131_62"><sup>62</sup></a> who had been brought up in the Church and was learned in the Scriptures. That woman had asked him to deign to speak with me and refute my errors and disabuse me of my wrong ways and teach me good ones, as he habitually did when he found people apt for such instruction. But he refused. This was surely a wise decision, I realized later. For he replied that I was still hardened against learning, all the more because I was puffed up with the novelty of that heresy and I had already been harrying quite a few people who were unskilled in debate with some nitpicking questions—just as she had warned him. “But,” he went on, “leave him be awhile. Only pray to the Lord for him. He will discover, by reading, what a mistake that heresy is, and what a gross impiety.”</p>
<p>At the same time the bishop told her how he too had been enticed away from his mother while still quite young and delivered into the hands of the Manichaeans: there he had not only read but also copied out almost all their books. He had come to realize, without anyone arguing or persuading him, how that sect ought to be shunned. So he had shunned it. When he had told her this, she was reluctant to agree with him, but pressed him even harder with prayers and copious tears to meet me and have discussions with me. Eventually he became irritated by the monotony of this and told her, “Let me be! On your life, it is impossible that the son of your tears should perish!” As she often used to reminisce in her conversations with me, she took those words as pronouncements resounding from heaven.</p>
