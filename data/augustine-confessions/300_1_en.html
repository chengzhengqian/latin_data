So he was made known to the saints of old <span class="marginNote right">1 Tm 2:4-5</span>so that they could be saved by their faith in his Passion which was yet to come, just as we are saved by faith in that Passion now that it has taken place.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_187_143" id="target_note_LCL027_187_143"><sup>143</sup></a> Only inasmuch as he is human is he a mediator: inasmuch as he is the Word, he is not set in the middle, <span class="marginNote right">Phil 2:6<span class="linebreak"></span>Jn 1:1</span>because he is God’s equal, and God with God, and both together are one God.</p>
<p>(69) How you have loved us, good Father! You did not spare your only Son, but for us—while we were still sinners—you gave him up! How you have loved us! For our sake he did not think it robbery to be your equal, but was made humble, even to the death of the Cross. He alone was free among the dead,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_187_144" id="target_note_LCL027_187_144"><sup>144</sup></a> <span class="marginNote right">Jn 10:17-18</span>he possessed the power to lay down his own life<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_187_145" id="target_note_LCL027_187_145"><sup>145</sup></a> and the power to take it up again, for us he became both victor and victim in your sight, <span class="marginNote right">Hb 9:28</span>and in fact he became a victor precisely because he was a victim, for us he was both priest and sacrifice before you, <span class="marginNote right">Hb 7:27</span>and in fact he became a priest precisely because he was a sacrifice. <span class="marginNote right">Gal 4:7</span>He made us your children instead of your slaves, by being born of you, yet becoming our servant.

If it were not so I would be in despair. Many and great are my infirmities, many and great! But your medicine is more abundant still. We could imagine your Word to be far from any kind of union with humanity—and to despair of ourselves—<span class="marginNote right">Jn 1:14</span>had he not become flesh and dwelt among us.</p>
