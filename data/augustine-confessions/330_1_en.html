could be measured. But even then it was not something steady; it was passing; and then passing away.

<p>If it could be measured, just look!—consider whether one voice begins to sound, and goes on sounding in an unbroken tone without any interruption. Let us measure it while it is sounding. When it stops sounding, it has already passed away, and there will be nothing in existence capable of being measured. So by all means let us measure it and declare how long it is. But it is still sounding, and cannot be measured unless from its beginning, when it started to sound, to its end, at which point it stopped. We can certainly measure the actual interval from whenever it began, to whenever it finishes. Therefore a voice that has not stopped sounding cannot be measured, to say how long or short it is; and it cannot be called equal to something else, or single, or double, or whatever, compared to something else. Once it is finished, it exists no longer. On what terms, therefore, can it possibly be measured? And yet we do measure times, not those that do not yet exist, and not those that exist no longer, much less those that have no dimension in time, or those that are unending. So we measure neither future nor past nor present nor passing time—and yet measure it we do.</p>

The relationship between word-accent (or “stress”) and syllable-quantity (or time-length) in the performance of Latin poetry in this period is controversial: Cicero remarks, “As if to modulate human speech, nature herself has placed on every word a sharp sound, only one, and never further back than the antepenultimate syllable” (Cic.  <span class="italic">Orat.</span> 57).
