<p>What holds for the whole hymn holds for the individual parts of it too, and the individual syllables, and for the longer performance (of which the hymn is only a part): and in a whole human life, the parts of which consist of all the actions of that human individual; and in the whole age of the children of men,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_255_78" id="target_note_LCL027_255_78"><sup>78</sup></a> the parts of which consist of the lives of every human being.</p>
<p>29. (39) <span class="marginNote right">Ps 63:3</span>Since your<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_255_79" id="target_note_LCL027_255_79"><sup>79</sup></a> mercy is better than life itself, look and see that my life is a kind of distraction.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_255_80" id="target_note_LCL027_255_80"><sup>80</sup></a> <span class="marginNote right">Pss 18:35, 63:8</span>Your right hand has supported me in my Lord who as the Son of Man is <span class="marginNote right">1 Tm 2:5</span>mediator between you who are One, and us who are many, drawn in many directions by many factors, <span class="marginNote right">Phil 3:12-14</span>so that through him I may take as my own the one who has made me his own. Leaving behind my former times, I recollect myself and follow the One. I forget what is past, and instead of being distracted<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_255_81" id="target_note_LCL027_255_81"><sup>81</sup></a> I reach out, not for what is in the future and so transitory, but for those things which are before me: I press forward, going in the right direction, rather than being distracted, to the prize<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_255_82" id="target_note_LCL027_255_82"><sup>82</sup></a> of my highest calling. There I shall hear the voice of praise and shall <span class="marginNote right">Ps 27:4</span>contemplate your delight<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_255_83" id="target_note_LCL027_255_83"><sup>83</sup></a> which neither comes into being nor passes away.</p>
<p>Now, though, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 31:10</span>my years are spent in groaning, and you are my consolation, Lord, for you are my eternal Father. But I became alienated as I entered into time, not knowing the order in which it passes, and my thoughts, the inmost parts of my soul, are ripped apart by turbulent vicissitudes, until I flow back together toward you, purged, and shining with the fire of your love.</p>
