 spring of fresh water, so that the earth may also bring forth its fruit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_371_56" id="target_note_LCL027_371_56"><sup>56</sup></a> <span class="marginNote right">Ps 85:12</span>And the earth does bear fruit; and when you, the Lord its God, <span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:11</span>give the command, our soul begins to blossom its works of mercy according to their kind, <span class="marginNote right">Mt 19:19, 22:39</span>showing love to a neighbor by offering help for their bodily needs. For our soul has within itself the seed of similar neediness; from our weakness we have compassion that prompts us to help those in need and to offer them relief: in the same way as we would want to receive help ourselves, if we were to find ourselves in a similar situation of need. This is true not only in easy situations comparable with seed-bearing grasses, but also in preserving the power to help by means of enduring strength—such as a fruit-bearing tree that provides help in rescuing someone who suffers injury from the hand of an oppressor, and by offering them a protective refuge through the enduring strength of righteous judgment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_371_57" id="target_note_LCL027_371_57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
