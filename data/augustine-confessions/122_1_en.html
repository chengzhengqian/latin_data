<p>(4) It was clear that I was not going to get a chance to interrogate your holy oracle, the heart of Ambrose, as I wanted, except when some matter required a brief hearing. My storms of emotion needed his complete attention if they were to be poured out to him, but they never secured it. I used to listen to him every Sunday, preaching the word of truth<span class="marginNote right">2 Tm 2:15</span> in the proper fashion before the congregation. I became more and more convinced that all the tangles of false and conniving charges that those men deceived us by using to stigmatize the holy books could be undone. Then, indeed, I learned from your sons according to the spirit, whom you have made anew<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_245_16" id="target_note_LCL026_245_16"><sup>16</sup></a> through grace from our mother the Catholic Church, that humanity is not to be understood as made in your image<span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:26</span> in such a way that they must likewise believe and think that <span class="italic">you</span> are confined by the form of a human body. Although I had not the faintest glimmer of a notion how there could be such a thing as a “spiritual substance,” I was nevertheless delighted as well as embarrassed, not because I had been opposed to the catholic faith for so many years but because I had been snarling against concepts of the physical that were entirely imaginary. I had been so impetuous and irreverent because I had made assertions and found fault concerning matters that I should have mastered through proper research. For you are both transcendent and immanent, entirely unknowable, yet close at hand; it is not that some parts of you are greater while others are smaller, but everywhere you are present in your entirety, and at the same time you are never confined to one place. You are certainly not in that physical form, yet you have made humanity in your image, and look! from head to foot humanity is physically and spatially confined.</p>
