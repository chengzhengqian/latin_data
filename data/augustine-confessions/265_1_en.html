This is how it works when we look for something we have lost, and find it. If, however, it happened that something passed out of sight, rather than out of memory—any kind of physical object, for example—an interior impression of it is preserved, and it is searched for, until it is restored to our sight.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_117_59" id="target_note_LCL027_117_59"><sup>59</sup></a> Once it has been found, it is recognized by reference to that interior impression.

Or rather, it had not vanished completely: the fraction that remained present went in search of the rest of the whole, because the memory was aware that what it was ruminating upon was not exactly the same as usual, and so, as if it its normal shape was mutilated<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_117_60" id="target_note_LCL027_117_60"><sup>60</sup></a> and it lacked some part of itself, it was insistent that the missing element be restored.
