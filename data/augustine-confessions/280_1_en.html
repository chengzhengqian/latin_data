<p>I heard another saying of yours, <span class="marginNote right">Sir 18:30</span>“Do not pursue your physical desires, and let your pleasure be forbidden.” By your gift<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_147_90" id="target_note_LCL027_147_90"><sup>90</sup></a> I heard another saying, which I really loved, <span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 8:8</span>“We shall have no abundance if we do eat; and we shall lack nothing if we do not eat”; in other words, it is not the case that the one thing will make me wealthy, but the other wretched.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_147_91" id="target_note_LCL027_147_91"><sup>91</sup></a> I heard yet another, <span class="marginNote right">Phil 4:11-13</span>“For I have learned to be content whatever my circumstances: I know how to cope with plenty, and I know how to cope with poverty.
