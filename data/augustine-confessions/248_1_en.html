I asked the heaven, the sun, the moon, the stars: “neither are we the God whom you seek,” they say. And I said to all these things that cluster round with access to my physical self, “Tell me about him, as you are not my God, tell me something about him,” and they cried aloud with a great voice, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 100:3</span>“it is he who has made us.” My questioning was the scrutiny I gave them, and their replies showed their beauty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_83_18" id="target_note_LCL027_83_18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>So I turned my gaze to myself and said to myself, “who are you?” and I replied, “a human being.” And look—my body and the soul in me are at my service; one is exterior and the other interior. Which of these two should I have used to seek my God? For by now I had used my senses<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_83_19" id="target_note_LCL027_83_19"><sup>19</sup></a> to look for him from the earth beneath to the heaven above, as far as I could send the beams of my eyes as my emissaries.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_83_20" id="target_note_LCL027_83_20"><sup>20</sup></a> Better look to the inner self. After all, that was where all those physical messengers reported back, as it exercised control and judgment respecting the replies of heaven and earth and all that is in them, saying, “we are not God,” and “he made us.” <span class="marginNote right">Eph 3:16</span>My inner self knew these things through the agency of my outer self. I, the inner self, knew these things—I who am a mind by virtue of the sense perceptions of my body—I asked the whole physical structure of the world about my God, and it replied to me, “I am not God, but God made me.”</p>
<p>(10) Surely this beauty is clear to all whose perceptions are sound? So why does it not speak alike to all? Living <span class="marginNote right">Ps 104:25</span>creatures great and small can see it, but they cannot ask questions because they do not have reason set in command over their senses (which do report the perceptions)
