 I recall it. But sometimes the enjoyment was from good and wholesome things, which I remember with longing, though if they happen not to be present, it is with sadness that I remember my former enjoyment.</p>
<p>(31) Where and when, therefore, did I gain my experience of the blessed life, thus giving me the capacity to recall, love and long for it? It is not just I, or with a few companions,—absolutely every one of us longs to be blessed. And unless we were definitely familiar with it we would not long for it with such a determined will. But what is it? If one were to ask two men whether they would like to be soldiers, one might be willing, and the other might refuse. But if one were to ask the same two men whether they would like to be blessed, they would both declare without hesitation that they would like to. And yet the one would opt for military service, and the other refuse it, for no other reason than that they wanted to be blessed. Can it possibly be that one person finds enjoyment in one thing, and another in something else? Thus all people are agreed that they want to be blessed: in the same way that if they were asked about it they would agree that they wanted to have enjoyment, and they describe such enjoyment as a blessed life. Even if, however, one person pursues it in one direction, and another in some other direction, the thing that everyone strives to win is the same: namely, enjoyment. Since, moreover, enjoyment is something that no one can claim never to have experienced, they discover it in their memory and recognize it when they hear the phrase “the blessed life.”</p>
<p>22. (32) Far be it, O Lord, far be it from your servant’s heart—the one who makes his confession to you—far be it from me to think myself blessed in every kind of enjoyment
