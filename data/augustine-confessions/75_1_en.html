my Hope, you who cleanse me from all the foulness of such affections,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_151_27" id="target_note_LCL026_151_27"><sup>27</sup></a> directing my eyes toward you, and drawing my feet out of the snare<span class="marginNote right">Ps 25:15</span>. I was amazed that the rest of humanity went on living, because he whom I had loved as if he would never die had in fact died; and I was even more amazed that I remained alive when he was dead, because he was like my twin self. How rightly someone once called his friend, “half of my own self.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_151_28" id="target_note_LCL026_151_28"><sup>28</sup></a> For I felt that my soul and his were one soul in two bodies, and that was why life was dreadful to me, because I did not want to live as half a person: and perhaps that was why I was afraid to die in case he whom I had loved so much would therefore die completely.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_151_29a" id="target_note_LCL026_151_29a"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>7. (12) What insanity is this, not knowing how to love humanity as it really is!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_151_30" id="target_note_LCL026_151_30"><sup>30</sup></a> O the folly of humanity, so unable to endure its human lot with a degree of self-control! Such was my predicament at that time. How I raged, I sighed, I wept, I was distraught! I had no peace, and no purpose! I was carrying about with me my shattered, bleeding soul; it could not endure being carried by me, but I could find nowhere to set it down. Not in pleasant woodlands could it find any peace, nor in sports and music, nor in sweet-scented groves, nor in elaborate banquets, nor even in the pleasure of bed and couch, nor—finally—in books and poetry.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_151_31" id="target_note_LCL026_151_31"><sup>31</sup></a> Everything was dreadful, even the light itself. Everything that was not in the same state as he was intolerable
