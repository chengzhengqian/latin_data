and to be willing was the same as already doing. But still it was not coming to pass; instead my body was all too easily controlling the feeble will of my soul<span class="marginNote right">cf.

Let the light of your mercy illuminate this question, and let me ask whether perhaps the enigma of human sufferings, and the darkened griefs of Adam’s offspring, can reply.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_395_41" id="target_note_LCL026_395_41"><sup>41</sup></a> Where does this perversion come from?

In fact it does not exercise its will completely. For this reason it does not have complete command.
