upon the sand by loving someone mortal as if they were immortal?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_155_35" id="target_note_LCL026_155_35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>To be sure, the consolation of other friends did much to restore and renew me. In their company I loved what I loved in place of you, but it was all a great fantasy, a massive lie, corrupting our minds with their itching ears<span class="marginNote right">2 Tm 4:3â€“4</span> by the stimulus of heretical ideas. Yet that fantasy of mine refused to die, no matter what friends of mine might perish. They possessed other characteristics that used to captivate my mind even more: conversation, shared laughter, doing a kindly turn for one another, reading honey-tongued books together, having fun together and being serious together, sometimes disagreeing without rancor as people might do when reflecting within themselves, and spicing up our many agreements with a sprinkling of dissent; one moment teaching a subject, the next learning from someone else; being troubled by longing for those who were absent, rejoicing to greet them on their return. By these signs and others like them, proceeding from the hearts of those who love and return the love of others, by means of the mouth, tongue, eyes and a thousand welcome gestures, we fueled the fusing of our minds and made, from many, one.</p>
<p>9. (14) This is what we treasure about friends, and we treasure it in such a way that the human conscience feels guilty if it does not love what loves it in return, or does not love in return that which loves it first. It asks for nothing in return from that person except for evidence of goodwill. This is what causes grief when someone dies, and the darkness of distress, and a heart brimming over when what is sweet turns to bitterness, and, when the dying lose their hold on life, life begins to die in those who are left alive.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_155_36" id="target_note_LCL026_155_36"><sup>36</sup></a>
