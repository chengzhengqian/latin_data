It is difficult for me to gather how far I am cleansed of that disease, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 19:12</span>and I am very afraid of my secret faults which are clear to your eyes, but not to mine. In respect of other kinds of temptation I have a fair degree of capacity for self-examination, but on this one, practically none. I can observe how much progress I have made in curbing my mind from physical pleasures, and from any idle curiosity for understanding things when I go without those things, either through deliberate choice, or because opportunities for them are lacking. Then I examine myself: how much more or less burdensome was it to go without them?
