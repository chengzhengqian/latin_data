who was not a Manichaean<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_127_56" id="target_note_LCL026_127_56"><sup>56</sup></a> were hungry and seeking something to eat, and a morsel were given to them, that same morsel would be condemned to death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_127_57" id="target_note_LCL026_127_57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>11. (19) And you sent forth your hand from on high and rescued my soul from this deep darkness<span class="marginNote right">Ps 144:7</span> when my mother, your faithful one, wept to you on my behalf more than mothers weep at physical deaths. For she was able to perceive my death through the faith and spirit<span class="marginNote right">Gal 5:5</span> that you granted her, and you heard her prayer, Lord. You heard her and you did not despise her tears. They poured out and watered the ground beneath her eyes wherever she prayed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_127_58" id="target_note_LCL026_127_58"><sup>58</sup></a> Yes, you heard her. Where did that dream come from after all, by which you consoled her so that she let me live with her and have my meals with her at home, when she had become reluctant to allow this because she loathed and detested my blasphemous heresy? She saw herself standing upon a kind of wooden ruler<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_127_59" id="target_note_LCL026_127_59"><sup>59</sup></a> and a glorious young man coming toward her smiling cheerfully at her, though she herself was sorrowful and overcome with grief. When the youth asked her the reasons for her sorrow and her daily weeping (to instruct her, as was fitting, rather than be instructed), she replied that she was bewailing my damnation. At this he warned her most solemnly (to reassure her) to pay attention and observe that where she was, there I was also<span class="marginNote right">cf. Jn 14:3</span>. As soon as she heard this, she saw me standing beside her on the same ruler.</p>
<p>Where did this come from, unless it was the case that your ears were attentive to her deepest longing, O you who are good and all-powerful, who care for each one of us as if you care for us alone, and so care for us all like individuals?</p>
