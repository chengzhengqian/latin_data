example there are disgraceful actions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_119_44" id="target_note_LCL026_119_44"><sup>44</sup></a> that are against nature in every place and always attract condemnation and punishment, such as those of the Sodomites<span class="marginNote right">Gn 19:4–5</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_119_45" id="target_note_LCL026_119_45"><sup>45</sup></a> If all nations committed this shameful act, then divine law would hold them guilty on the same charge, namely that God did not make men to exploit one another in such a way. Indeed that actual union that we ought to have with God is violated when the very nature which he created is desecrated by such a perversion of sexual desire.</p>
<p>But shameful actions that are contrary to ordinary human morality must be avoided in accordance with the multiplicity of prevailing custom, so that what is agreed within a polity, or by national custom, or supported by law, must not be violated because of one person’s sexual desire, be he citizen or foreigner. Every part that is not conformed to its whole is a cause for reproach. Yet when God orders something contrary to the custom or agreement of a group of people, even if it has never been done there before, it must be done from then on; and if it has been neglected, it must be restored; and if it had not been established, then now it must be established. For if a king is allowed, in the realm which he rules over, to command something which no one before him nor he himself had ever commanded, and obeying him does not run counter to the common good of the his realm (indeed <span class="italic">not</span> to obey runs counter to the common good; for it is a universal consensus of human societies to obey their rulers), how much more should we be unhesitatingly compliant with the commands of God, the ruler over all his own creation! For just as in the authorities of human society a greater authority wins a higher obedience than a lesser, so God is obeyed above all.</p>
