<p>I could not ask him what I wanted, as I wanted: not when flocks of busy men (for he was always tending to their frailties<span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 6:1</span>) were keeping me away from hearing him or speaking to him. When he was not with them, which was never for very long, he was either nourishing his body with the food it needed or nourishing his mind with reading. But when he was reading, his eyes would scan over the pages and his heart would scrutinize their meaning—yet his voice and tongue remained silent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_243_13" id="target_note_LCL026_243_13"><sup>13</sup></a> Often when we were present (no one was ever forbidden to enter, nor was it his custom to have those approaching him announced) we saw him reading like that, silently, but never aloud. We used to sit for long periods of silence—who would presume to intrude on someone so intent?—and then depart, on the assumption that in these short periods of time, carved out from the hustle and bustle of other people’s problems, which he secured for refreshing his mind, he did not want to be distracted toward other things. Perhaps he was also avoiding having to explain to an engrossed and attentive listener anything that the author he was reading had put in terms unclear, or to give a commentary on some other complex subjects. Given all the time he spent on such duties, he read<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_243_14" id="target_note_LCL026_243_14"><sup>14</sup></a> fewer books than he wanted to, though in fact the aim of saving his voice, which all too easily became strained, could be a better justification for reading silently. Whatever his reason for doing so, a man like him was certainly doing it for the best.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_243_15" id="target_note_LCL026_243_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
