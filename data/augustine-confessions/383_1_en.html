What is out of its proper place is restless; once in its proper place it finds rest.</p>
<p>My love is my gravitational force; wherever I am carried, it is love that carries me. By your gift we are enkindled and borne upward, we begin to glow with fire, and up we go.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_353_22" id="target_note_LCL027_353_22"><sup>22</sup></a> <span class="marginNote right">Ps 84:5Vg</span>We climb the steps in our heart and we sing a song of ascent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_353_23" id="target_note_LCL027_353_23"><sup>23</sup></a> By your fire, your good fire, we begin to glow with fire, and up we go, for we are climbing upward to the peace of Jerusalem;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_353_24" id="target_note_LCL027_353_24"><sup>24</sup></a> for I was glad at those who said to me, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 122:1</span>We shall go into the house of the Lord. There a good will shall find us a home, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 61:7</span>so that we have nothing to wish for other than to remain there for ever.</p>
<p>10. (11) Blessed is the created realm<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_353_25" id="target_note_LCL027_353_25"><sup>25</sup></a> that knew nothing else, although it might have been something else but for your gift, the Spirit, which moved above all that is changeable. As soon as it was made, with no passage of time, it was sublimated by your calling, and saying, “Let there be light,” and it became light. In our case there was a shift in time, for we were once darkness, and now we are made light. But in the case of the creation, it was stated what it would be if it had not been enlightened; and it was stated in such a way—as if formerly it had been darksome and in flux—to make clear why it was made to be different: that is, so that it would be converted to the never-failing light, and would itself be light.</p>
<p>Let those who can, understand this; let them ask you questions. <span class="marginNote right">Gal 6:17<span class="linebreak"></span>Jn 1:9</span>Why do they trouble me as if I were able to enlighten any human being who comes into the world?</p>
