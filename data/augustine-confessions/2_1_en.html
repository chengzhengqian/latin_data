they believe without a preacher?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_5_6" id="target_note_LCL026_5_6"><sup>6</sup></a><span class="marginNote right">Rom 10:14</span> Those who seek the Lord will praise him: those who search, find him<span class="marginNote right">Mt 7:7</span>; and when they have found him they will praise him. So let me seek you, Lord, while I invoke you in prayer; and let me invoke you while I believe in you. You have been preached to me. That faith of mine, Lord, which you have given to me, which you breathed into me by the incarnation of your Son, invokes you in prayer through the ministry of your preacher.</p>
<p>2. (2) And how shall I invoke my God, my God and my Lord<span class="marginNote right">Jn 20:28</span>, in prayer? Certainly, when I do invoke him in prayer, I shall be summoning him into my very being. What place is there in me where my God may enter in, where that same God who made heaven and earth<span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:1</span> may enter into me? Is it so, O Lord my God? Is there any part of me capable of encompassing you? Or is it the case that heaven and earth, which you made, and in which you made me, encompass you? Is it the case that because whatever exists would not exist but for you, whatever exists must contain you? Therefore since I too exist, why do I ask you to enter into me, when I would not exist but for your presence in me? After all, I am no longer in Hell<span class="marginNote right">Ps 86:13</span>; and yet there too you are present: for even if I go down into Hell, you are there<span class="marginNote right">Ps 139:8</span>. So I would not exist, my God, I would not exist at all, unless you existed in me. Or rather, I would not exist unless I existed in you, by whom everything is, and through whom everything is, and in whom everything is<span class="marginNote right">Rom 11:36</span>. So it is, Lord, so it is. How am I to invoke you in prayer when I exist within you? Where would you come <span class="italic">from,</span> into me? Where would I have to withdraw <span class="italic">to,</span> beyond heaven and earth, to reach a place from which my God could enter into me?—for he declares, “I fill heaven and earth.”<span class="marginNote right">Jer 23:24</span></p>
