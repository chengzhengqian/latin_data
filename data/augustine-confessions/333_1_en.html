diminishes, the past grows, until the future is spent and everything is the past.</p>
<p>28. (37) But how is the future diminished or spent, given that it does not yet exist? And how does the past increase, since it exists no longer?—unless because in the mind which deals with this matter they are three separate things. For that mind looks forward; and is aware; and remembers: so what it looks forward to shifts through what it is aware of into what it remembers. Who can deny that past events no longer exist?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_253_77" id="target_note_LCL027_253_77"><sup>77</sup></a> Yet there remains in the mind a memory of past events. And who can deny that the present time has no temporal amplitude, because it passes in a moment? Yet our awareness endures, and through that attention what is in the future presses on to become no more. So it is not a future time which is long, because that does not exist; a “long future” is really a long expectation of the future. Likewise, a time past is not long, because it does not exist; and a “long time past” is really is a long-lasting recollection of what is past.</p>
<p>(38) Imagine that I am about to recite a hymn that I know. Before I start, my expectation extends to the hymn as a whole. But once I begin, whatever part of that expectation I have plucked away goes into the past and is retained in my memory: the life force of my performance is in tension between memory (because of what I have already spoken) and expectation (because of what I have yet to say). My awareness is in the present though; and through it what was future crosses over to become the past. The longer the performance continues, the more my expectation is reduced and my memory prolonged, until expectation is entirely exhausted: and once the whole performance of the hymn is finished it shifts into memory.</p>
