<p>13. (15) If a person lets their passing thoughts ramble among impressions of past time, and is astonished that you, almighty God, the creator and preserver of all,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_215_38" id="target_note_LCL027_215_38"><sup>38</sup></a> the maker of heaven and earth, had—before that great work—nothing to do for countless ages, until you finally created it; that person should wake up and pay attention, because what astounds them is simply not true. Where could these countless passing ages come from, since you had not made them?—<span class="marginNote right">Hb 1:2</span>although you are the author and founder of all ages! What spans of time could have existed unless you had established them? And how could such times have elapsed, if they never existed? Because you are the maker of all times, if there was some sort of time before you created heaven and earth, why is it said that you were not spending your time working?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_215_39" id="target_note_LCL027_215_39"><sup>39</sup></a> For you were the maker of time itself, so time could not pass before you had created time.

Rather, you precede everything that has passed in time by the sublimity of your ever-present eternity, and you reign supreme over all that is to be, because it is all yet to happen, and when it does come, it will then be in the past. You yourself, on the other hand, are always the same, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 102:27</span>and your years will not fail. Your years do not come and go.
