things of which this mutable world consists so inconsistently;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_273_16" id="target_note_LCL027_273_16"><sup>16</sup></a> from which its mutability becomes apparent, the means by which we are aware of time and measure it, because times are created by changes in things, as the forms of things (which consist of the invisible earth already mentioned) fluctuate and alter.</p>
<p>9. (9) So when the Spirit, your servant’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_273_17" id="target_note_LCL027_273_17"><sup>17</sup></a> teacher, records that in the beginning you made heaven and earth, he says nothing about time, mentions nothing about days. The heaven of heaven that you made in the beginning is surely some kind of intellectual creation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_273_18" id="target_note_LCL027_273_18"><sup>18</sup></a> Although by no means coeternal with you, the Trinity, it nonetheless became a sharer in your eternity; it certainly holds its mutability in check for the sake of the sweet delight of that greatest joy, contemplating you.

Not even that very shapelessness—the earth invisible and unstructured—is reckoned in the counting of days. Where there is no shape, no structure, there nothing comes or goes; and where this does not happen there are undoubtedly no days, and no progression in periods of time.</p>
