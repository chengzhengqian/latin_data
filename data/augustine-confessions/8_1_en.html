memory. Or do you smile at me for asking these questions—and decree that I must praise you for what I do know about you, and confess my faith in you?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_17_24" id="target_note_LCL026_17_24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>(10) I make my confession to you,<sup> </sup><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_17_25" id="target_note_LCL026_17_25"><sup>25</sup></a> Lord of heaven and earth<span class="marginNote right">Mt 11:25</span>, and I sing your praises for my origins and infancy, which I do not remember. You have allowed this mortal man to deduce facts about himself from the examples of others, and also to understand a great deal about himself from evidence given by mere women.

Since your years do not fail<span class="marginNote right">Ps 102:27</span>, those years are the same as a “today.”</p>
<p>How many days of ours and of our fathers have now traversed your eternal today, and have taken from it the measure and manner of their existence? And yet others will pass through in future: they will receive likewise the manner of their existence. And still you yourself remain the same: everything tomorrow and beyond, everything yesterday and before, all of it you will make, and you have made, your “today.” Do I care if anyone cannot understand
