it is not a case of those that arrive pushing out those that are leaving, because there is no transience. Our years will only be completed when they all exist no longer. <span class="marginNote right">Ps 90:4; 2 Pt 3:8</span>Your years are a single day, and your “day” is not “every day” but “today,” because your “today” does not give way to tomorrow; neither does it follow on after yesterday. Your “today” is eternity; therefore the one to whom you said, “Today I have begotten you” is begotten coeternally.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_217_41" id="target_note_LCL027_217_41"><sup>41</sup></a> You have made all times, and you are antecedent to all times: and there was never a kind of “time” when time did not exist.</p>

If no one is asking me a question about it, I know what it is; but if I want to explain it to the questioner, I do not know how to. Nonetheless, I state firmly that I know this: if nothing were to pass away, there would be no past time; and if nothing were impending, there would be no future time; and if nothing existed there would be no present time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_217_43a" id="target_note_LCL027_217_43a"><sup>43</sup></a> So how do those two “times,” past, and future, exist, when
