<p>Once all these matters were safe and confirmed unshakeably in my mind, I began to seek feverishly for the origin of evil. How great were the torments of my heart as it went into labor<span class="marginNote right">cf. Jer 48:41, 49:22</span>, O my God, and the cries of pain! And your ears were there to hear, though I did not know it. Though I searched valiantly in silence, the silent sufferings of my soul were loud cries for your mercy.
