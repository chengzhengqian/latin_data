are calling “mind” is actually memory. But if this is really the case, why is it that when I happily recall my past sadness, my mind experiences happiness and my memory contains sadness—and that my mind is happy because of the happiness it contains, whereas my memory, despite the sadness which is in it, it not in itself sad? Surely it is not because memory has nothing to do with mind? Who could say such a thing? It is certain, then, that memory is like the mind’s stomach, and happiness and sadness are like sweet and bitter food for it. When they are committed to memory, it is as if they were transferred into the stomach to be stored there; they can no longer impart any taste.

I am not disturbed by any of the disturbances they produce when I remember them and so recount them. There they were, before I recalled them and reconsidered them. For that reason they could be summoned up through an act of recollection. Perhaps, then, memory brings things back through an act of recollection like food brought back from the stomach when an animal chews the cud. If so, why is the sweetness of joy or the bitterness of grief not tasted in the mouth of their thought<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_105_48" id="target_note_LCL027_105_48"><sup>48</sup></a> by the person making the
