patience at how scrupulously mortals<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_53_96" id="target_note_LCL026_53_96"><sup>96</sup></a> observe conventions of spelling and syllable division that they learned from those speakers who have gone before them; and yet they neglect the enduring terms of their everlasting salvation that they received from you.
