 a reliable measurement of time either, since it is possible that a shorter verse can be sounded over a more generous length of time, if it is pronounced in a protracted manner, than a longer one if it is pronounced in a more clipped fashion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_245_63" id="target_note_LCL027_245_63"><sup>63</sup></a> This is true of poems, feet, syllables.</p>

I either say something imprecise, like, “this time is longer than that one,” or something precise, like, “this time is double the length of that.” I know I am measuring time; but I am not measuring the future (because it does not yet exist), and I am not measuring the present (because it has no amplitude), and I am not measuring the past (because it no longer exists). So what am I measuring? Is it times as they are actually passing, rather than once they have passed? That is what I said earlier.</p>

It ceases, and now there is silence, and that voice has passed away and there is no voice any longer. Before it sounded, it was in the future, and it could not be measured because it did not yet exist; and now it cannot because it exists no longer. So it could be measured then, while it was still sounding, because then something existed which
