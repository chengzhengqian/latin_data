 disgrace, and shall do so to your praise<span class="marginNote right">Ps 106:47</span>. Permit me, in this present memoir, allow me, I pray, to encapsulate the whole cycle of my heretical belief, now long past,<span class="marginNote right">Ps 27:5–6</span> and bring an offering to you, a sacrifice of thanksgiving<span class="marginNote right">Ps 50:14</span>. What am I to myself, without you, if not the director of my own downfall? Again, what am I when I am in a better state,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_135_5" id="target_note_LCL026_135_5"><sup>5</sup></a> if not a babe sucking milk from you<span class="marginNote right">Ps 8:3; 1 Cor 3:1–2</span>, or tasting you, the food which is imperishable? Again, what kind of a person is anyone who is a human being and nothing more? Yet though the strong and powerful laugh at us, still we who are poor and weak will make our confession to you<span class="marginNote right">Ps 74:21</span>.</p>
<p>2. (2) During those years<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_135_6" id="target_note_LCL026_135_6"><sup>6</sup></a> I used to teach the art of rhetoric—I who was enslaved by desire was selling all-conquering eloquence. Yet as you know, Lord, I preferred to have good pupils (in the ordinary sense of the term “good”) and I was teaching deceit to those who were not then deceivers, not so that they would act against the lives of the innocent but so that sometimes they would protect the guilty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_135_7" id="target_note_LCL026_135_7"><sup>7</sup></a> God, you saw from afar how I stumbled in slippery places<span class="marginNote right">Ps 72:18</span>, and the glimmer of integrity in that lightless murk that I manifested in my role as teacher to those who loved vanity and sought after lies<span class="marginNote right">Ps 4:2</span>—and I was of their company. During those years I kept to one woman, whom my roving desire, completely lacking in self-restraint, had pursued. But it was not that form of union which alone is recognized as legitimate. Still, she was the only one, and I kept faith with her as with a spouse. With her I experienced, through my own behavior, what a gulf separates a proper style of marriage, a covenant entered into for the sake of procreation, and a transaction based on erotic desire, when any offspring are born despite the couple’s prayers—though once they have been born they make loving them inevitable.</p>
