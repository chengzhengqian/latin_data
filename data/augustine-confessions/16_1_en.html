defiled by sin if I survived—and it is certain that after that baptismal washing the guilt attached to the stain of sins would be more serious and dangerous than before. So I believed, as did my mother and all the household except for my father. But he did not overrule the power of my mother’s devotion in me to prevent me from believing in Christ, although he himself was not yet a believer. My mother was active in ensuring that you were a father to me, O my God, rather than he. And you supported her in overcoming her husband—she was usually obedient to him, even though she was his moral superior—for in doing so it was really you that she was serving, and this was your command to her.</p>
<p>(18) My God, I ask you—I should like to know, if only you wanted me to—for what reason my baptism at that time was postponed, whether it was for my own good that I had the reins of sin loosened upon my neck, so to speak. Or were they not loosened after all? After all, why is it that even now, the words resound in our ears concerning someone or other, “Leave him be, let him do it—he’s not yet been baptized!”? When it comes to physical health we do not say: “Let him be wounded some more: after all he has not yet been cured!” How much more quickly and completely would I then have been healed! Then my own love and that of my family would have brought it about that the salvation of my soul was secured<span class="marginNote right">Ps 34:3</span>, and through the protection of you who bestowed it, it would have been safe indeed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_33_52" id="target_note_LCL026_33_52"><sup>52</sup></a> Yes, that would have been the better course. But however many and great those floods of temptations were which seemed to threaten me after my childhood, that mother of mine knew of them already. And her wish was to consign to those floods that earth from which I was afterward formed, rather than the actual image itself<span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:27, 2:7, 3:19</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_33_53" id="target_note_LCL026_33_53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
