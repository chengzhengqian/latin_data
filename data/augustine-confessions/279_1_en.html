 pleasantness associates itself like a constant attendant, often trying to step in first, so that what I either say or wish I was doing for the sake of health, I am actually doing for the sake of pleasure. It is not the same measure for both: what is enough for health is too little for delight, and often it is unclear whether it is a matter of appropriate care for the body, seeking what it needs, or the sensual deceit of desire, looking to be catered for. Amid this ambiguity the unhappy soul cheers up and prepares a self-justificatory defense, glad that it is not apparent what suffices for maintaining good health, so that on a pretext of health it may conceal a transaction which is really about pleasure. There are the temptations I try to resist daily, and I call upon your right hand, and I bring to you all my passions, because as yet I have formed no resolve on this subject.</p>
<p>(45) I hear the voice of my God commanding me, <span class="marginNote right">Lk 21:34</span>“do not let your hearts be overloaded with gluttony and drunkenness.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_145_89" id="target_note_LCL027_145_89"><sup>89</sup></a> As for drunkenness, I keep it at a distance: you will take pity on me, and not let it come any closer to me. Gluttony, though, has often crept up on your servant; you will take pity on me, and make it distant from me. <span class="marginNote right">Ws 8:21</span>No one can exercise self-control except by your gift. There are many things you bestow on us when we pray; and whatever good we have received before we prayed for it, it was from you that we received it. Even our realization of this later on was a gift you gave us. I have never been a drunk, but I know drunks who have been made sober by you. So it is your doing that those who never have been drunkards should never become so; and it is your doing that those who were drunkards should not be so for ever; and it is your doing that both groups of people should know whose doing it is!</p>
