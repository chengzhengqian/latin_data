<p>And I did not know that God is a spirit<span class="marginNote right">Jn 4:24</span> and not a being possessing parts with breadth and length, or one consisting of physical mass: after all, any physical mass is less in its parts than in its entirety; and even if it is infinite, it is less in one part of a certain defined size than it is in its infinitude.
