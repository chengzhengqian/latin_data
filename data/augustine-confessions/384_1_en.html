<p>11. (12) Who can understand the almighty Trinity? Who does not speak of it—if it is actually the Trinity that is spoken of?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_355_26" id="target_note_LCL027_355_26"><sup>26</sup></a> There are not many souls that know what they are talking about when they talk of the Trinity. Still they dispute and do battle; yet no one devoid of peace beholds that vision. I wish people would meditate upon the triad within themselves:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_355_27" id="target_note_LCL027_355_27"><sup>27</sup></a> such a triad is far removed from that Trinity, but I am stating it as a topic for them to occupy themselves and investigate and feel how far from it they are. This is the triad I mean: to be, to know, and to will.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_355_28a" id="target_note_LCL027_355_28a"><sup>28</sup></a> For I am, and I know, and I love. I exist knowingly and willingly. I know that I exist and have a will; and I am willing to exist and to know. Let those who can, see how there is in these three an indissoluble life: and one life, and one mind, and one being<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_355_29" id="target_note_LCL027_355_29"><sup>29</sup></a>—in conclusion an distinctness that is inseparable, yes, but still distinct. Surely it is self-evident to people: let them scrutinize themselves and observe, and tell me. But when they find something of the kind therein, and say so, they must not think that they have found that which is on high and unchangeable: which exists unchangeably, and knows unchangeably, and wills unchangeably.</p>
<p>As for whether this triad<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_355_30" id="target_note_LCL027_355_30"><sup>30</sup></a> is the foundation of that Trinity; or whether the triad exists in each of the Three,
