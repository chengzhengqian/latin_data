<p>(20) Look at present time, which was the only kind we found that should be called “long”; it has shrunk to barely the span of a single day. Now let us break this day apart as well, because not even a single day is entirely in the present. It consists of twenty-four hours in all, some diurnal and some nocturnal: the first hour sets all the rest in the future, the last sets all the rest in the past, any of the intervening ones has those hours that are past ahead of it, and those that are yet to come behind it. Each actual hour consists of fleeting moments. Whatever part of that hour has flown by is in the past; whatever yet remains is in the future. If we can imagine any part of time that cannot be subdivided into even the tiniest fractions of moments, that alone can be called “the present”; though it too speeds rapidly from the future into the past, without even a brief delay.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_223_46" id="target_note_LCL027_223_46"><sup>46</sup></a> Even if it has some continuation, it is still divided into past and future: but the present has no extension in time.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_223_47" id="target_note_LCL027_223_47"><sup>47</sup></a> So where is this time which we are to call “long”? In the future? We do not say, “it is long” because nothing yet exists to be called long, but we say, “it will be long.” So when will it be long? If at that point in time it is still in the future, it will not be long, because nothing as yet exists capable of being long. But if it appears long at the moment when something from the future—which is as yet nonexistent—now begins to come into existence, and is made present (so that it can exist because it has extension in time) immediately the present time cries out (as discussed earlier) that it cannot in itself be long.</p>
