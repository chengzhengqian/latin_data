<p>(4) O Lord, have mercy upon me and hear my desire: for I do not think it is concerned with the earth, not about gold and silver and precious stones, or fine clothing, or honors and power, or pleasures of the flesh. Neither is it to do with bodily needs or for this life of pilgrimage we live—<span class="marginNote right">Mt 6:33</span>yet all of these are given in addition to those of us who seek your kingdom and your righteousness. See, O my God, where my desire originates. <span class="marginNote right">cf. Ps 119:85</span>The unrighteous have regaled me with stories of pleasures, but they are nothing like your law, Lord. Look—this is where my desire originates. See, Father! Give heed, and see, and approve: <span class="marginNote right">Ps 19:14</span>let it be pleasing in view of your mercy that I find <span class="marginNote right">Ex 33:13</span>grace in your presence, so that the deeper truths of your words may be opened to me when I knock. I make my prayer through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 80:17</span>the man standing at your right hand, the Son of Man,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_197_16" id="target_note_LCL027_197_16"><sup>16</sup></a> whom you established for yourself as <span class="marginNote right">1 Tm 2:5</span>mediator between you and us,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_197_17" id="target_note_LCL027_197_17"><sup>17</sup></a> through whom <span class="marginNote right">Rom 10:20</span>you sought out those who were not seeking you. You sought them out so that they would seek you; your <span class="marginNote right">Jn 1:3</span>Word through which you made all things (myself among them), your only Son through whom you have called a <span class="marginNote right">Gal 4:5</span>population of believers (myself included) to be adopted. I make my prayer through him who sits at your right hand and speaks up on our behalf to you: in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden—and those treasures are what I seek in your books. Moses wrote about him; Christ himself says so, <span class="marginNote right">Jn 5:46</span>he who is the Truth says so.</p>
<p>3. (5) Let me hear and understand how it was that in the beginning you made heaven and earth. Moses wrote this,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_197_18" id="target_note_LCL027_197_18"><sup>18</sup></a> he wrote it and he has departed, he has made the transition from here to you: and he is not now before me.
