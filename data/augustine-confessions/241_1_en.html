<p class="noindent">1. (1) You know me:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_69_1" id="target_note_LCL027_69_1"><sup>1</sup></a> let me know you, <span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 13:12</span>let me know even as I am known. You are the strength of my soul; enter into it and shape it to your will, so that you keep and possess it <span class="marginNote right">Eph 5:27</span>without blemish or wrinkle.

I could hide you from myself: but I cannot hide myself from you. But now, because my groaning acts as my witness that I am dissatisfied with myself, you shine brightly and are pleased, and loved, and longed-for; and so I blush with shame at myself and abandon myself and choose you and—unless I am in you—I am pleasing neither to you nor to myself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_69_4" id="target_note_LCL027_69_4"><sup>4</sup></a> I am open to you,
