my mind is mindful of itself: but you were not there either. This was because in the same way as you are not a physical impression nor a living person’s emotion (such as exists when we enjoy something, grieve, desire, fear, remember, forget, and other such experiences) so too you yourself are not the mind, because you are God and Lord over the mind. And all these thing undergo change, but you remain unchangeable over all things, and you have deigned to dwell in my memory, from the time I came to learn of you. Why do I ask in what part of my memory you dwell, as if the regions there are real?

You reply clearly, but not everyone hears you clearly. Everyone has something they want to ask about: but they do not always hear what they want to. Your ideal servants are those who no longer look to hear from you the answer that they want, but instead want what they hear from you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_133_73" id="target_note_LCL027_133_73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
