the long ones sounded for a greater time, and the shorter ones for less?</p>
<p>O God, let humanity see in this small example the familiar marks of things great and small. <span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:14</span>In heaven the stars and sun and moon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_237_58" id="target_note_LCL027_237_58"><sup>58</sup></a> mark signs and seasons, days and years. This is so, but I still would not say that the rotation of the potter’s wooden wheel constituted a day, nor should that learned person have declared that its rotation did not constitute a period of time.</p>
<p>(30) I long to know the force and nature of time, by which we measure the movements of bodies and we say, for example, that one movement take double the length of time taken by another. This is my question: since a day is said to be not just the lingering of the sun above the earth (according to this, part is “day” and part is “night”) but also its entire course from the east back to the east again, which lets us say, “so many days have passed” (for days are counted so as to include their nights, and the duration of the night is not reckoned a separate thing)—since a day is completed by the movement of the sun and its course from the east back to the east again, I am asking whether it is the movement which constitutes a “day,” or the length of time it takes to pass, or both. If the former constitutes a day, it would still be a day even if the sun completed its course in so short a span of time as a single hour. If the latter, it would not count as a day if from one rising of the sun to the next took so short a span of time as a single hour—instead the sun would have to complete twenty-four circuits to make up a day. If it takes both, it could not be called a day if in the space of an hour the sun completed its entire circuit; nor could it if the sun stopped moving
