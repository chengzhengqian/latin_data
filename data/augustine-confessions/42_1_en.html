by which you forgive the sins of those who turn to you? As for anyone who was called by you, and followed your voice, and avoided what they read me recollecting and confessing about myself, let them not laugh at me in my sickness for being healed by the very doctor who ensured that they themselves were not sick, or rather were less sick.

Who is it who can teach me, except the one who illuminates my heart and penetrates its shadows? What is this thing that has come into my mind to seek out, and investigate, and weigh up? Because if then I loved those fruits that I had stolen and was longing to enjoy them, I could have done it alone. If it was enough to commit that sin by which I achieved my pleasure, I would not have had to kindle the itch of my greedy desire through the stimulus of complicit consciences. Because my pleasure was not in the pears, it was in the actual crime that a fellowship of sinners committed together.</p>
