<p class="noindent">1. (1) <span class="marginNote right">Ps 59:17</span>O my God, my mercy, I invoke you in prayer, for you made me, and when I forgot you, you did not forget me.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_337_1" id="target_note_LCL027_337_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I invoke you to enter my soul, which you are making ready to receive you by means of the desire that you have breathed into it. Now that I am invoking you, do not abandon me: <span class="marginNote right">Ps 58:10</span>prior to my invocation you went before me and pressed me with increasing frequency, by all kinds of arguments, to hear you from afar and to be converted, and to invoke you when you called me. For you, Lord, have abolished all the evils that I deserved, so as not to recompense <span class="marginNote right">Ps 18:20</span>the work of my hands in which I forsook you; and have anticipated all the good things that I have deserved, so as to recompense the work of your hands, with which you made me: because even before I began to exist, you existed; I did not exist for you to grant existence to me—and yet look! I exist, this whole being that you have made me out of your goodness going before me,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_337_2a" id="target_note_LCL027_337_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and from which you have made me. For you had no need of me. Nor am I such a good thing as to be of assistance to you, my Lord and my God, to help you—as if preventing your becoming exhausted by activity; or as if your power would be diminished
