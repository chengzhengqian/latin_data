those who see things in the Spirit of God, “it is not you who are doing the seeing.” Whatever they see as being good, therefore, in the Spirit of God, it is not they but God who sees that it is good.</p>
<p>It is a different matter when someone considers something to be bad, when in fact it is good, as was mentioned earlier. And it is a different matter again for people to see what is good and recognize its goodness—as, for example, your creation, which delights many by its goodness—but in that creation they find no pleasure in you, for creation is what they want to enjoy, rather than you. It is different again that when people see that something is good, it is God within them who sees that it is good, so that God is certainly loved in what he has made, and he would not be loved except by the Spirit which he has given, <span class="marginNote right">Rom 5:5</span>since the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us: through it we see that whatever exists, to some degree, is good; for its existence comes from him who is not existent to some degree, but is existence itself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_417_113" id="target_note_LCL027_417_113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
