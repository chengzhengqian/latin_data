 and everything—was imperishable and unvarying and completely immutable, I still did not consider that the cause of evil has been explained and untangled. Whatever kind of thing it was, I saw that it required investigation if I was not to be constrained to believe that the immutable God is mutable, and so become myself the very thing I was looking for.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_301_13" id="target_note_LCL026_301_13"><sup>13</sup></a> So I began my search, at first without anxiety. I was sure that it was not true, what those men used to say, the ones I had begun to flee with all my heart, because I saw that by seeking where evil comes from, they came to be filled with sin,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_301_14" id="target_note_LCL026_301_14"><sup>14</sup></a><span class="marginNote right">Rom 1:29</span> in that they preferred to believe that your very being could admit of evil rather than that their own could commit it.</p>

But I had not the strength to evaluate the matter clearly. So even as I tried to draw my mind’s eye up from the deep I started to sink down again. Over and over I tried, but again and again I sank. What raised me into your light was the fact that I was as convinced that I had a will<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_301_15" id="target_note_LCL026_301_15"><sup>15</sup></a> as I was of being alive. So when I did or did not want something, I was absolutely convinced that it was no one but myself doing the wanting or not wanting. I was on the brink of perceiving that there, in my will, was the reason for my sin. I began to realize that I was enduring rather than committing the acts which I did against my will, and I judged that this was not so much my fault as my punishment. I quickly had to admit that my punishment was not undeserved, for I considered you to be righteous.</p>
