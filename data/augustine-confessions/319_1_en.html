<p>16. (21) Even so, Lord, we sense intervals of time and we compare them one with another, and we say that some are longer, and others shorter. For we measure how much one time is longer or shorter than another, and we reply that one is double or treble the length, while another is a single length; or that one is the same length as the other. But when we measure units of time as they pass, we do so by our sense perception of them: yet who can measure past times (which exist no longer) and future times (which do not yet exist)?—unless perhaps someone has the presumption to claim that they can measure what is nonexistent! So when time is passing, we can perceive it and measure it; but after it has passed, this is not possible, because it is nonexistent.</p>
<p>17. (22) I am asking questions, Lord, not making statements. O my God, <span class="marginNote right">Pss 23:1, 28:9</span>direct and rule me.

Perhaps they do exist after all, but time emerges from some hiding place when it turns from future into present; and retires to some other hiding place when it turns from present into past time. How else did bards foresee the future times of which they sang, if those times did not yet exist? It is not possible to see something which does not exist. As for those who tell the stories of the past, they would certainly not be recounting truth if they did not discern those things in their minds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_225_49" id="target_note_LCL027_225_49"><sup>49</sup></a> And if those things did not exist, it would be impossible to discern them. According to this, both future and past do exist.</p>
