blessed in their hope of it. These latter have a lesser kind of hope than those who are already truly blessed, but they are still in a better state than people who have neither present experience nor future hope of bliss. Such people as these would not even want to be blessed unless they had some grasp of bliss already: and they definitely do want it. Somehow they know it, and so they possess it through some kind of familiarity: I am trying to work out whether this familiarity resides in the memory, because if it is there, we have already been blessed at some time. I am not asking now whether this means all of us individually, or all collectively in that man who first sinned,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_121_62" id="target_note_LCL027_121_62"><sup>62</sup></a> and in whom all of us are dead, and from whom all of us were born in such a pitiable condition. What I am asking is whether the blessed life is present in our memory. For we would not love it unless we knew what it was. We hear the word “bliss” and we all admit that we are eager for the thing itself; it is not merely the word that delights us. For when someone Greek hears it in Latin, it causes no delight, because there is no understanding of what has been said. But we delight in it just like a Greek person would if they heard the Greek word for it: after all, bliss itself is not unique to either Greek or Latin, since Greeks and Latin speakers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_121_63" id="target_note_LCL027_121_63"><sup>63</sup></a> and people of every language are hungry to obtain it. Everyone knows it; and if everyone could be asked in a single language whether they wanted to be blessed, they would undoubtedly all answer, “yes.” This would not be possible unless the actual phenomenon which we call “bliss” was present in everyone’s memory.</p>
