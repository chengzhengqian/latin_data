from the stress of a long journey and making ready for the onward voyage. So we were conversing with pleasure, just the two of us, <span class="marginNote right">Phil 3:13</span>“forgetting the past but rather reaching out to what is to come.” In the presence of the Truth (which is who you really are) we were exploring the question of what the eternal life of the saints would be like, which <span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 2:9</span>“eye has not seen nor ear heard nor has it entered into the human heart.” We opened wide the mouth of our heart to drink deeply of the heavenly waters of your pure spring, the <span class="marginNote right">Ps 36:9</span>“well of life” which abides with you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_47_70" id="target_note_LCL027_47_70"><sup>70</sup></a> Then we were sprinkled<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_47_71" id="target_note_LCL027_47_71"><sup>71</sup></a> to the limit of our poor ability; and thus began to reflect widely on this great matter.</p>
<p>(24) Our conversation concluded that the enjoyment of the physical senses, however great, and however effective in giving earthly enlightenment, is not worthy to be preferred—not even considered—in comparison with the joy of eternal life. <span class="marginNote right">Ps 146:8</span>We raised ourselves up and with hearts aflame for the One<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_47_72" id="target_note_LCL027_47_72"><sup>72</sup></a> we made our gradual ascent through the physical world and even heaven itself, where sun and moon and stars shine upon the earth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_47_73" id="target_note_LCL027_47_73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>And now we were climbing still further by pondering, discussing and marveling at your works. We entered into our own minds and transcended them, to reach that place of unfailing abundance, <span class="marginNote right">Ez 34:14</span>where you feed Israel for ever with the food of truth. There, life is the wisdom by which all other things come to be, both past and future—wisdom which is not created but rather exists just as it always has been and always will be. In fact it does not have the capacity either to <span class="italic">have</span> existed, or to <span class="italic">come to</span> exist. It simply is, because it is eternal.</p>
