cannot measure it, to know how much I fall short of a proper degree of love, such that my life hurries right into your embrace, and does not deviate until it is <span class="marginNote right">Ps 31:20</span>hidden in the hiding place that is your presence. But this I do know: things go badly for me apart from you, both within me and without, and whatever rich abundance I possess that is not my God is nothing but poverty.</p>
<p>9. (10) Were not both the Father and the Son also “moving above the waters”? If this means like bodies in a physical space, then neither was the Holy Spirit; but if the unchangeable supremacy of the divine nature transcends all that is mutable, then Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit were all moving above the waters. Why then is this said only of the Holy Spirit? <span class="marginNote right">Acts 2:38, 8:20</span>Why is this only predicated of him, as though it was a place where he was to be found—though in truth it is not a place, and of him alone is it predicated that he is your gift?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_351_20" id="target_note_LCL027_351_20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>We find rest in that gift of yours, and there we enjoy you. Our rest is where we belong. Love sublimates us to that place, and <span class="marginNote right">Ps 143:10<span class="linebreak"></span>Ps 9:13<span class="linebreak"></span>Lk 2:14</span>your good Spirit lifts up our lowliness from the gates of death. In having goodwill<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_351_21" id="target_note_LCL027_351_21"><sup>21</sup></a> do we find peace. Under its own weight a body gravitates to its proper place; that gravitation is not always downward, but rather to that proper place. Fire’s natural path is upward, that of stone is downward: they have their own gravitational impetus, they make for their proper place. When oil is poured under water, it rises above the water’s surface; when water is poured onto oil, it sinks below the oil: they have their own gravitational impetus, they make for their proper place.
