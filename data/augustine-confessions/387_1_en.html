 friend, sighs for Christ, and already has the firstfruits of the Spirit within him; but still within himself he groans, as he awaits the adoption, <span class="marginNote right">Rom 8:23<span class="linebreak"></span>Rv 21:2, 9</span>which is the redemption of his body. He sighs for him (for he is a member of her who is the bride<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_361_40" id="target_note_LCL027_361_40"><sup>40</sup></a>), he is jealous for him (for he is the Bridegroom’s friend); he is jealous for Christ, not for himself, because he calls to the other deep in the voice of your waterfalls, not in his own voice. He is jealously protective of those who are there, for fear that as the serpent deceived Eve by its cunning, their senses will be corrupted from that pure state which is proper to <span class="marginNote right">2 Cor 11:3</span>our Bridegroom, your only Son. What is this light of beauty, <span class="marginNote right">1 Jn 3:2</span>when we shall see him as he is? As for the tears which have been my bread day and night, while they daily say to me, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 42:3</span>“Where is your God?”—those tears have passed away. </p>

But still my soul is sad, because it relapses and becomes an abyss once more—or rather it feels that it still remains an abyss. My faith, which you kindled in the nighttime to light the way before my feet,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_361_42" id="target_note_LCL027_361_42"><sup>42</sup></a> says to it, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 42:5</span>“Why are you sad, O soul, and why do you trouble me? Put your hope in the Lord. His Word is a lantern for your feet. Hope and endure, until the night passes (night is the mother of evildoers), <span class="marginNote right">Is 26:20<span class="linebreak"></span>Eph 2:3</span>until the Lord’s anger passes; we are children of that anger, but once we were darkness, and we bear the marks of it on our bodies, <span class="marginNote right">Rom 8:10</span>which are dead because of sin, <span class="marginNote right">Sg 2:17</span>until the day dawns and the shadows are dispelled. Hope in the Lord; <span class="marginNote right">Ps 5:3</span>in the morning I shall stand before him and gaze upon him, I shall make confession to him for ever.”</p>
