<p>9. (17) What were my thoughts and feelings? Certainly they were self-evidently shameful, and augured<span class="marginNote right">Jb 10:15</span> ill for me as I maintained them. But still, what actually were they? Who understands their faults?<span class="marginNote right">Ps 19:12</span> It was for a laugh, to give us a bit of a thrill, at the thought of cheating people who had no idea we were capable of such behavior and who would strongly disapprove. So why did I get pleasure from something that I would not have done at all if left to myself? Is it perhaps because no one finds it easy to laugh when alone? It is a fact that no one finds it easy, but even so laughter sometimes overcomes people when no one else is present, and they are solitary and alone, if something overwhelmingly silly impacts upon their senses or thoughts. Yet on my own I would never have done it, no, I definitely would not have done it on my own.</p>
<p>O my God, see the living memory of my soul in your presence! I would not have committed that theft on my own, a theft in which it was not the stolen items that pleased me but the very act of thieving. It definitely would not have pleased me to do it alone, nor would I have done it. What an extremely alien alliance it was—an unsearchable distraction of the mind! Out of a game and a lark came an eagerness to do harm, a taste for inflicting losses on others without myself gaining anything, or enjoying settling a score. Once someone says, “Come on, let’s do it,” it is shameful to be anything but shameless.</p>
<p>10. (18) Who is going to untie that tangled, twisted mass of knots? How vile it is—I have no desire to turn my attention to it, I have no desire even to look upon it. I desire you—O Righteousness and Integrity, both lovely and becoming to the gaze that is true, with an appetite that can never cloy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_87_35" id="target_note_LCL026_87_35"><sup>35</sup></a> With you there is deep peace and life
