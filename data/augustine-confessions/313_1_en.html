the same time, is not a long time at all? Then it will see that in eternity nothing passes, but everything is in the present; while time, on the other hand, is never completely in the present. And it would see that everything in the past is being driven out by the future, and that everything in the future is following what is past: all that is past and future is being created and issues forth from the one who is always present. Who will take hold of the human heart to make it stay still and see how eternity—which is neither past nor future—stands and prescribes the future and the past? Surely my hand has not the strength for this, or the hand of my mouth the fluency to handle such a lofty theme?</p>
<p>12. (14) Look—this is what I reply to someone who says, “what was God doing before he made heaven and earth?” I do not give the response attributed to a certain person, who playfully sidestepped the force of the question by saying, “He was getting Hell<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_213_36" id="target_note_LCL027_213_36"><sup>36</sup></a> ready for people who probe deep matters!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_213_37" id="target_note_LCL027_213_37"><sup>37</sup></a> Seeing the matter clearly is one thing, and making jokes about it is quite another: so I do not respond like that. I would much rather give a response, “What I don’t know, I don’t know,” than the reply that won a laugh against someone asking about deep matters, and praise for the person who gave a misdirected reply. But I say that you, our God, are the creator of the whole creation; and if the term “heaven and earth” is taken as meaning the whole creation, I can presume to declare, “before God made heaven and earth, he was not making anything.” For if he were making something, what would he be making if not the creation? If only I knew everything I desire to know for my own benefit, as firmly as I know that nothing was created before any part of creation came into being!</p>
