<p>17. (27) O my God, let me say something<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_49_85" id="target_note_LCL026_49_85"><sup>85</sup></a> about my intellectual ability, which was your gift to me, and the way I squandered it on such absurdities. A task was assigned to me, which quite roused my soul with thoughts of a reward of praise (and perhaps with a fear of disgrace and beatings too). It was to perform the speech of Juno when she was angry and hurt because she could not divert the Trojan king from Italy, words that I had never heard Juno utter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_49_86" id="target_note_LCL026_49_86"><sup>86</sup></a> Instead we were obliged to go astray by following the footsteps of poetical inventions, and to declaim in prose something similar to what the poet had written in verse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_49_87" id="target_note_LCL026_49_87"><sup>87</sup></a> The one who was displaying a more realistic impression of anger and hurt in defending the honor of the character being delineated (using appropriate words to clothe the ideas) was the one whose speech won the most praise. For what does it matter to me, O my true Life, my God, that they acclaimed my performance as superior to those of my contemporaries and fellow students? Look, surely all that stuff is just smoke and wind?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_49_88" id="target_note_LCL026_49_88"><sup>88</sup></a> Was there no other subject matter on which to hone my intellect and speaking skills? Your praises, Lord, your praises throughout your Scriptures would have supported the vine shoot of my heart,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_49_89" id="target_note_LCL026_49_89"><sup>89</sup></a> and then it would not have been carried away by the vacuity of trifling matters as prey for the birds of the air.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_49_90" id="target_note_LCL026_49_90"><sup>90</sup></a> There is more than one way of sacrificing to the rebel angels.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_49_91" id="target_note_LCL026_49_91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
