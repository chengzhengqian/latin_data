 I find? Something not disclosed to the proud nor made plain to children, but requiring humility in the approach yet becoming sublime and cloaked in mystery as one goes deeper.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_105_17" id="target_note_LCL026_105_17"><sup>17</sup></a> I was not fit to enter into it, or to bend my neck to making that ascent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_105_18" id="target_note_LCL026_105_18"><sup>18</sup></a> Back then, when I scrutinized Holy Scripture, I did not feel the way I now do when I speak of it. Instead it seemed to me unworthy of comparison with the merit of Cicero’s writings. My pomposity was repelled by its restraint, while my powers of perception could not penetrate its depths. It was something which could keep pace in its growth with little children; but I would not deign to become a little child—I saw myself as full of importance<span class="marginNote right">Ps 8:8; Lk 18:17</span>, I was bloated with disdain.</p>

At their heart there was not a particle of truth. And they were constantly declaring, “truth!” and “truth!” They often used to declare it to me, but it was nowhere among them. Instead they spoke lies, not only about you, who are truly Truth, but also about the elements of this world (that is, your creation); whereas I should have bypassed even those philosophers who do speak truly about those things, and preferred your love, my Father, my highest Good, Beauty of all beauties.</p>
