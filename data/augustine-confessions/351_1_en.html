there is a difference between Wisdom that creates and the wisdom that is created. There is the same difference between Righteousness that effects a righteous state in people, and righteousness that is the outcome of that act of making people righteous. Even we have been declared to be “your righteousness”; so said a certain servant of yours, <span class="marginNote right">2 Cor 5:21</span>“so that in him we might be the righteousness of God.”</p>
<p>So because a certain <span class="marginNote right">Sir 1:4</span>Wisdom was created before all other created things as the rational thinking mind belonging to your pure city, <span class="marginNote right">Gal 4:26; 2 Cor 5:1</span>our mother, which is above, and free, and eternal in heaven: and what can that heaven be but the <span class="marginNote right">Ps 148:4</span>heaven of heavens that praise you? For it is also the <span class="marginNote right">Ps 115:16</span>heaven of heavens belonging to the Lord. Although<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_289_38" id="target_note_LCL027_289_38"><sup>38</sup></a> we find that time did not exist before this wisdom (which was created before everything else) because it was antecedent to the creation of time, nevertheless the eternity of the Creator himself existed before that wisdom. When he made wisdom it took up its inception: not in time as yet, for time did not yet exist, but the inception of its own creation.</p>
<p>(21) So, our God, it derives from you in such a way that it is clearly a separate being, and not you yourself. Still we do not find time either before it or even in it, because its proper role is <span class="marginNote right">Mt 18:10</span>to look upon your face continually, and it is never distracted from it in any way (hence it allows no change or alteration). Despite this, it retains the capacity for mutability, by which it could darken and grow chill but for its cleaving to you in its great love, as if it were always shining with <span class="marginNote right">cf. Is 58:10</span>noonday light and blazing with your fire. O house of light and beauty, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 26:8</span>I have loved your grace and the dwelling place of the glory of my Lord your maker and master! My whole pilgrimage is a sighing after you, and I tell him who made you that he may take possession of me
