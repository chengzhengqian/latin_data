what is past exists no longer and what is future does not yet exist? As for present time, if it were always present, and did not shift into the past, it would no longer be time at all, but eternity instead. But if the present time, to be time at all, is such on the grounds that it shifts into the past, how can we also state that this entity exists, if the cause of its existence is that it will not exist? So in the end we cannot truly state that time exists, unless it is because it gravitates toward nonexistence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_219_44" id="target_note_LCL027_219_44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

For example: we describe a hundred years ago as “long time past,” and a hundred years in the future as a “long way off”: but a period of time past, such as, say, ten days, we call “short,” and such a period of future time we call “short” too. But on what terms is it either long or short, if it is nonexistent? For what is past no longer exists; and what is future does not yet exist. So we should not say, “it is a long time,” but rather should say about the past, “it was a long time,” and about the future, “it will be a long time.”</p>

This long period of time past, was it long when it was already past, or when it was still in the present? For it could then be long, at the time when something existed to be long: but when past it was already nonexistent, therefore it could not be long, because it was altogether nonexistent. So let us not say, “that time past was long”; and we shall not find anything that was long, since from the moment it came to be past, it no longer exists. Rather let us say, “that time was long while it was
