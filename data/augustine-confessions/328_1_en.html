have been speaking about time for some duration, and that this “duration” is only duration by virtue of the interval of time. So how do I know this, given that I do not know what time is? Perhaps I do not know how I should speak of what I do know? Pity me!—for I do not even know what it is that I do not know! <span class="marginNote right">Gal 1:20</span>Look, O my God, before you I do not lie! As are my words, so is my heart. <span class="marginNote right">Ps 18:28</span>You will light my lantern, O Lord my God, you will lighten my darkness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_243_60" id="target_note_LCL027_243_60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>26. (33) Surely my soul is confessing the truth when it confesses to you that I do measure time? If so, O my God, I am making measurements but do not know what I am measuring. I use time to measure the movement of a physical object: likewise, surely, I am measuring time itself? Could I even measure the movement of a physical object (how long it lasted and how long it took to go from here to there) without measuring the time within which it moved? So how do I measure time itself? Do we use a shorter time to measure a longer one in the same way as we do a cubit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_243_61" id="target_note_LCL027_243_61"><sup>61</sup></a> to measure a crossbeam? This is apparently how we use the length of a short syllable to measure the length of a long syllable and to describe the latter as double. In the same way we measure the length of poems by the length of lines, and the length of lines by the length of feet, and the length of feet by the length of syllables, and the length of long syllables by the length of short ones. We do not use page length (for then we would be measuring space, not time); but when the words pass away as they are pronounced, we say, “it is a long poem, for it the interweaving of so many lines; they are long lines, for they consist of so many feet; they are long feet, for they are the extension of many syllables; it is a long syllable, because it is twice the length of a short one.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_243_62" id="target_note_LCL027_243_62"><sup>62</sup></a> But this does not secure
