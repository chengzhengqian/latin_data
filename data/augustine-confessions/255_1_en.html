<p>10. (17) What is more, when I hear that there are three types of question,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_97_38" id="target_note_LCL027_97_38"><sup>38</sup></a> whether something exists, what it is, and what kind of thing it is, I retain the impressions of the sounds of which these words were composed, and I know that those sounds once traversed the air making their noise but no longer exist. But as for the actual things that those sounds signify, I have never touched them with any bodily sense, nor have I seen them anywhere but in my mind; and what I have stored in my memory is not impressions of them but the things themselves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_97_39" id="target_note_LCL027_97_39"><sup>39</sup></a> Where they came from when they entered into me let them say, if they can: for I have scanned every way in to my physical self and cannot find where they have made their access. Certainly my eyes say, “If they had any color to them, we are the ones who made it known!” My ears say, “If they made a noise, we told of it!” My nostrils say, “If they had a smell, it passed to you through us!” My taste buds say, “If it is not a matter of flavor, don’t ask us!” My sense of touch says, “If it has no physical bulk, I have not touched it; if I have not touched it, I have not told you of it.” Where from, and how, did these things enter into my memory? I do not know how. For when I learned them, I did not rely on someone else’s mind, but recognized them in my own, and agreed that they were true, and entrusted them to my memory as if I were tucking them away ready to be retrieved when I wanted them. So they were in my mind even before I had learned them,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_97_40a" id="target_note_LCL027_97_40a"><sup>40</sup></a> but they were not yet in my memory.
