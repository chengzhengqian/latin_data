Of this famous lyrical passage, Burnaby notes, “The happiness which is the aim of human endeavour consists . . . in a relation of knowledge and love which binds the soul to the one immutable Reality” (<span class="italic">Amor Dei, </span>49). A.’s terminology for love is much discussed; elsewhere he uses <span class="italic">amor,</span> <span class="italic">dilectio,</span> and <span class="italic">charitas</span> interchangeably (<span class="italic">Ench.</span> 117). Courcelle, <span class="italic">Recherches,</span> 441–78, surveys the influence of the <span class="italic">sero te amavi </span>in history; he quotes Nygren’s view that A. was original in rescuing the verb <span class="italic">amare</span> for the vocabulary of Latin spirituality. (Courcelle, <span class="italic">Recherches</span> 461, quoting Nygren,<span class="italic"> Ehrenrettung von “amor,” </span>367–73). The rhetorical casting is obvious; but what draws it into the category of “non-prose” (some, but not all, editions print it as such) is not Classical meter or the medieval <span class="italic">cursus</span> but an antiphonal structure, which renders it akin to psalmody.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL027_135_75a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
