my demands, even though carrying them out would be harmful? So the weakness of infant limbs compasses innocence,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_21_30" id="target_note_LCL026_21_30"><sup>30</sup></a> but with the minds of infants it is not so. I have observed and experienced a little one expressing jealousy. Though he was not yet capable of speech, he glared, pale with envy, at his sibling at the breast. Surely everyone knows this! Mothers and wet nurses claim to avert this behavior by their own particular charms. Surely one cannot call it “innocence” when a baby prevents his sibling—who is completely dependent for care, and stays alive only because of that one source of sustenance—from having a share in the plentiful, abundant flow of milk.

Even if you had done nothing but that, no one else but you could do even so much: you are unique, and every kind of being comes from you; you are most beautiful, you who form everything and dispose it according to your law.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_21_33" id="target_note_LCL026_21_33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
