It was not the case that when he came with me I had no privacy; after all, how could he abandon me in such distress? We sat down as far away from the house as possible. I was groaning in spirit,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_393_37" id="target_note_LCL026_393_37"><sup>37</sup></a><span class="marginNote right">Jn 11:33, 38</span> I was furiously indignant that I could not enter into a covenant and agreement with you, my God, when all my bones<span class="marginNote right">Ps 35:10</span> were crying out that I should do so, and were praising it to the skies.
