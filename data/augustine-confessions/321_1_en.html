it is perhaps not the actual events (which do not yet exist, because they are in the future) but their causes or clues that are seen, because they are existent in the present. So those things are not future but present to those who observe them: they use them to predict future events that they have conceived in their mind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_229_51" id="target_note_LCL027_229_51"><sup>51</sup></a> Now these mental conceptions exist; and the people who make predictions about them contemplate them internally as present events. Let the vast quantity of instances impart to me just one example: I observe the dawn, and I predict that the sun is about to rise. What I am observing is in the present; what I am predicting is the future. It is not that the sun is in the future, because it already exists—but its rising, that does not yet exist: unless I imagined its rising in my mind, as I am doing now in speaking of it, I would be unable to predict it. That dawn, however, which I see in the sky is not the rising of the sun, although it precedes the sun; similarly it is not a prefigurement in my mind. Both these phenomena are present and discernible, so that the sunrise, which is yet to be, can be predicted. Future phenomena do not yet exist, and if they do not yet exist they do not exist at all; and if they do not exist at all, they certainly cannot be seen; but they can still be predicted by means of factors in the present, which do now exist and are visible.</p>
