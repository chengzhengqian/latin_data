in such quick succession that the space of time between, however much impact people may insist that this has in the nature of things, is too small to be reckoned by human observation. It certainly cannot be set out in formulae with the precision that the astrologer looks for in order to make accurate predictions. In any case they will not be true, because an inspection of the same formulae should have led to the same predictions about Esau and Jacob<span class="marginNote right">Gn 25–36</span>, but what befell them was not the same. So the astrologer would predict what did not happen, or if he predicted what did, he would not predict the same for both: and yet what he observed<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_317_21" id="target_note_LCL026_317_21"><sup>21</sup></a> would be the same. So his predictions would prove accurate not by skill but by chance.</p>
<p>Lord, you are the most righteous Ruler of the universe. Although they do not realize it, you act by a hidden inspiration upon those who consult about astrology and those who are consulted,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_317_22" id="target_note_LCL026_317_22"><sup>22</sup></a> so when someone does go for a consultation, that person hears what it is right for them to hear according to each soul’s secret deserving out of the bottomless depths of your righteous judgment<span class="marginNote right">Ps 36:6</span>. Let no one say to you, “What is this?” or “why is this?”<span class="marginNote right">Sir 39:21</span>; let no one say this, let no one say that, for all are mere mortals.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_317_23" id="target_note_LCL026_317_23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>7. (11) So, my Helper<span class="marginNote right">Ps 18:2</span>, you had already freed me from those chains and I was now searching for the origin of evil, but there was no way through. But you did not allow any fluctuations of thought to carry me away from that faith I believed: that you exist, that your substance is unchanging, that your care for humanity is real and your judgment, and that you have established a way for humanity to be saved into the life that is to be after this death, in Christ your Son, our Lord, and in the holy Scriptures that the authority of your Catholic Church enjoins.</p>
