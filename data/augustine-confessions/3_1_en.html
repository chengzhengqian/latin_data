(3) So: because you fill them, does it follow that heaven and earth contain you?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_7_7" id="target_note_LCL026_7_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Or do you fill them, and yet something remains because they cannot contain you? Where do you pour out whatever of yourself is left over, once heaven and earth are filled?
