<p>O Truth, Truth! How deeply, even then, the marrow of my soul was really sighing with longing for you, while their individual speakers and their many weighty books proclaimed you to me so often, and in so many ways. And as I hungered for you, those were the platters on which they served up to me (instead of you yourself) the sun and moon, which are beautiful works of yours, but “works” is all they are. They are not you yourself, they are not even your primary works,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_107_21" id="target_note_LCL026_107_21"><sup>21</sup></a> for your spiritual works come before those physical ones, however luminous and heavenly they may be.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_107_22" id="target_note_LCL026_107_22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

Because I thought that these were you, I fed on them. To be sure I did not do so eagerly, because in my mouth you did not taste as you really are, even though you were not one of those empty illusions. So I was not nourished by them, but instead was utterly drained. Food in dreams is very like food when we are awake, yet those who sleep are not nourished by eating it, precisely because they are asleep! Those things were not at all like you, O Truth, as you now speak to me—they were imaginary objects, not real physical objects at all. As for the real physical things (whether heavenly or earthly) which we see with our human sight, along with the cattle and birds of the air, those imaginary things made them more definite.
