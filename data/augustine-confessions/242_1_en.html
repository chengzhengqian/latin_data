Lord, whoever I am. I have already declared the benefits which have brought about my confession to you, and I do not do so with fleshly words and sounds but with the words of my soul and the clamor of my thoughts, which your ear comprehends. When I am bad, confessing to you is nothing more than dissatisfaction with myself: whereas when I am devout, confessing to you is nothing more than not giving myself the credit for it, for you, Lord, <span class="marginNote right">Ps 5:12; Rom 4:5</span>are the one who blesses the righteous person, but before you make that person righteous they are ungodly.
