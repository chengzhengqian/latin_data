of eight syllables alternates between short and long syllables. So the four short ones (the first, third, fifth and seventh) have a single time-value, compared to the four long ones (the second, fourth sixth and eighth). The latter group each have twice the time value of the former. I pronounce the line, and announce that this is the case so far as clear sense perception can tell. So as far as sense perception is clear, I measure a long syllable against a short, and find that the long has twice the length. But when they sound one syllable after another, if the short is first and the long follows, how shall I keep a grip on the short, and how shall I apply it to the long in order to measure it, so that I find that it is twice the length—for the long does not begin to sound until the short has ceased to do so? Am I to measure the long syllable while it is sounding? But unless it is finished, how am I to measure it?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_249_71" id="target_note_LCL027_249_71"><sup>71</sup></a> Its final moment is its passing away: so what is there for me to measure? And where is the short syllable I am using for my measuring? Where is the long syllable that I am to measure? Both have sounded, both have since fled, both have passed away: they are no more.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_249_72" id="target_note_LCL027_249_72"><sup>72</sup></a> Still I measure, and reply honestly that, as far as my trained ear is reliable, the one is single, the other double, at least as far as the extent of time is concerned. But I cannot do this unless they have passed away and are at an end. So I am not measuring the sounds themselves (which no longer exist) but instead what remains in my memory, because there is it imprinted and remains.</p>

The kind of poetry he is investigating relies on predictable patterns of sound; hypothesizing syllable length is a simple matter, even if proving it is not. The next section acknowledges this in terms of “impressions of sounds.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL027_249_71').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL027_249_72"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL027_249_72" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">72</sup>Homeoteleuton of three verbs, followed by three emphatic monosyllables.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL027_249_72').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
