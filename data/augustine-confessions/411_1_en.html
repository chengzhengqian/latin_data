 gift and fruit. A gift is the actual thing that someone gives when providing us with necessaries, for example cash, food, drink, clothing, shelter, help. Whereas fruit consists in the good and fitting intention of the giver. Our good teacher did not simply say, <span class="marginNote right">Mt 10:41-42</span>“who receives a prophet,” but added, “in the name of a prophet”; nor did he say only, “who receives someone righteous,” but added, “in the name of someone righteous.” So the one will surely receive a prophet’s reward, and the other the reward of the righteous. Nor, for that matter, does he only say, “whoever gives a cup of cold water to one of my little ones for them to drink,” instead he adds, “just in the name of a disciple,” and so he added, “Amen<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_409_101" id="target_note_LCL027_409_101"><sup>101</sup></a> I say to you, they will not lose their reward.” A gift consists in receiving a prophet, or someone righteous, or offering a cup of cold water to a disciple; whereas fruit consists in doing these things because the person is a prophet, or righteous, or a disciple. <span class="marginNote right">1 Kgs 17:6, 10-15</span>Elijah was fed by fruit that came from a widow who knew that it was a man of God she was feeding, and who fed him for that reason: but the food he ate from the raven was a gift. And Elijah was not fed in his interior self, but only in his exterior self, that part of him which might perish for want of such food.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_409_102" id="target_note_LCL027_409_102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
