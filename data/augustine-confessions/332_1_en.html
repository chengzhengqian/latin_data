pressions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_251_73" id="target_note_LCL027_251_73"><sup>73</sup></a> I insist, it is in you that I measure times. What I measure is the actual present impressions produced in you by passing events; and which remains when those events have passed: not the actual present event, not those things which have passed and so let the feeling come into being. That is what I measure when I measure time. Therefore either this is what times really are, or I am not in fact measuring time.</p>
<p>What about when we measure silences, and we say that one silence has lasted as long as another sound? Surely we stretch our power of understanding to measure the sound (as if it were still audible), so that we can produce a report of some sort into the periods of silence within the overall time frame? Without a sound from our voice, our lips, in our minds we scrutinize poems and lines and speech of all kinds, and the shaping of any of their constituent parts: and as far as periods of time are concerned, and how one relates to another, we report that they are exactly the same as if we were speaking them aloud.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_251_74" id="target_note_LCL027_251_74"><sup>74</sup></a> Suppose that someone wants to produce a rather long<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_251_75" id="target_note_LCL027_251_75"><sup>75</sup></a> sound, and determines in advance how long the sound is going to be: surely that person ran through the length of time silently and committed it to memory, and then began to produce that sound, which keeps resonating until it reaches the predetermined finish. In fact the sound has sounded, and will keep sounding; for the part of it that is over certainly did sound, but the part that is still to come, that will sound and then will come to its end. At the same time our present intention draws the future into the past:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_251_76" id="target_note_LCL027_251_76"><sup>76</sup></a> as the future
