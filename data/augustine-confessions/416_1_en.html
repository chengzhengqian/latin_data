like vapor and fall as dew on nights when air is still,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_419_116" id="target_note_LCL027_419_116"><sup>116</sup></a> and those which surge and flow in power here on earth. We see the beauty of the massed waters<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_419_117" id="target_note_LCL027_419_117"><sup>117</sup></a> across the calm surface of the sea,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_419_118" id="target_note_LCL027_419_118"><sup>118</sup></a> and the dry land emerging unclothed and taking shape, to become visible and constituted so as to provide a substrate for plants and trees. We see the lights of heaven shining from on high: the sun making provision for the day, the moon and stars bringing comfort to the night<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_419_119" id="target_note_LCL027_419_119"><sup>119</sup></a>—and all of them marking out and indicating time. We see the natural realm of water on every side, made fruitful with fish and sea creatures, and birds on the wing as well (because the physical density of air that raises up the birds’ flight is increased by evaporation from the waters).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_419_120" id="target_note_LCL027_419_120"><sup>120</sup></a> <span class="marginNote right">Gn 7:3, etc.</span>We see the face of the earth endowed with land animals: and humanity, in your image and likeness, set in authority over all irrational creatures, by virtue of your actual image and likeness (which means in virtue of humanity’s reason and understanding). Just as in the soul one part is in control and makes decisions, and another is in subjection to it and is obedient, so too in physical terms woman was also made for man, having an equal nature in terms of her mental capacity for reason and understanding, but as far as her physical sexual identity as a woman is concerned, she is in subjection to the sexual identity of a man. Likewise, an urge to take action is in subjection to such mental understanding as produces the skilled knowledge to act rightly.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_419_121" id="target_note_LCL027_419_121"><sup>121</sup></a> <span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:31</span>We see these things and all of them are good, and all together they are very good.</p>
