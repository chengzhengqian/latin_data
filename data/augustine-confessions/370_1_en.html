the universe being already shaped, one may properly ask of them, if God made this “at first,” what did he do next? And they will find nothing that followed after the entire universe, and as a result will not want to hear the question, “How could that come first, if nothing came after it?”</p>
<p>When they say that at first creation was shapeless, and later acquired a shape, they are not being foolish—provided that they have the capacity to distinguish what goes first in eternity, and in time, and in choice, and in origin:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_327_74" id="target_note_LCL027_327_74"><sup>74</sup></a> in eternity, as God precedes all things; in time, as flower precedes fruit; in choice, as fruit precedes flower; in origin, as sound precedes song. In these four, the first and last that I have mentioned are hardest to interpret, while the second and third are very easy. For contemplative vision is both rare, and enormously demanding, Lord—to behold your eternity, which immutably creates mutable things and is, accordingly, prior to them.</p>
<p>Next, who has such mental acuity that they can discern without any great effort how sound is temporally prior to song? For song is sound that has been given structure:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_327_75" id="target_note_LCL027_327_75"><sup>75</sup></a> and certainly something that has not been given shape can still exist, whereas how can what does not exist be given shape? So matter is prior to what is made from matter. It is not prior because it is itself the maker; instead it is itself created. Nor is it prior in terms of time-intervals: For we do not first in time produce shapeless sounds without song, and at a later time adapt those sounds into the shape of a hymn, nor do we mold them like wood (to make a
