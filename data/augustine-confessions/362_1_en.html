this to the best of my poor ability (which I confess to you, my God) I see that two types of disagreement can arise when honest reporters relate something in terms of signs:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_311_60" id="target_note_LCL027_311_60"><sup>60</sup></a> one, if there is a disagreement over the truth of the facts, the other, if the disagreement is about the intention of the person relating the facts.
