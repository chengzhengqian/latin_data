those who wield spiritual authority, but also those under their spiritual direction, are spiritual beings, and whether they command or obey they exercise spiritual judgment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_393_83" id="target_note_LCL027_393_83"><sup>83</sup></a> This is how you made humanity—male and female in your spiritual grace; <span class="marginNote right">Gal 3:28</span>in this realm there is no male nor female in terms of physical gender, just as there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave nor free.
