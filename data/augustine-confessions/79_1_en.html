<p>O my God, Creator of all things,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_159_40" id="target_note_LCL026_159_40"><sup>40</sup></a> let my soul praise you for all those things: but let it not be stuck fast to them with glue, with the love that comes through the bodily senses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_159_41" id="target_note_LCL026_159_41"><sup>41</sup></a> For they go where they were always going, into nonexistence, and they tear the soul apart with unhealthy desires: for the soul wishes to exist yet loves to find peace in those things that it loves.
