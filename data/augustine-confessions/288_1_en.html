“seen.” But we do not only say, “See how it glows!” (which only the eyes can appreciate) but also, “See what a noise!” “See what a smell!” “See what a taste!” “See how hard it is!” And so a typical sensory experience is called visual desire, as I have said; because the function of “seeing,” in which the eye have pride of place, is claimed by the other senses for their own, by analogy, when they are investigating any kind of knowledge.</p>
<p>(55) This makes it even clearer to discern in what way pleasure and curiosity are functions of physical sensation. Pleasure pursues what is beautiful, melodious, delightful, delicious, polished; but curiosity pursues the opposite of these, purely for the sake of testing boundaries—not because it wants to endure hazards, but because of its craving for experience and understanding. What, after all, is the inherent pleasure in looking at a mangled corpse that revolts you? And yet if one happens to be lying there, people flock to it to be appalled, to turn pale. Then they are afraid that they will see the corpse in their sleep, as if someone had forced them to look at it when they were awake, or some rumor had convinced them that it was a beautiful sight. The same holds for the other senses, but it would be excessive to examine them all in detail. Monstrous sights are paraded in public shows to pander to this disease of desire. This sets in motion investigation into the secrets of nature (which are beyond our ken); it does no good to know these things, and such people want nothing else but to know. This is also what prompts some to use magical arts with the same objective, namely corrupt knowledge. And likewise even in the matter of religion they put God to the test, demanding signs and portents; they long for these not to help their own salvation but rather solely for experience’s sake.</p>
