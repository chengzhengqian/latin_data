penetrated the farthest reaches of my memory, those various dimensions miraculously full of riches beyond counting. Then I examined them closely, and I was dismayed, and I could distinguish nothing of them without you, and I found that none of them was you. Nor was I the originator, though I had traversed all things and tried to demarcate and evaluate each thing in accordance with its particular qualities. I accepted some things just as my senses communicated them and so investigated them; other things I perceived to be inherent in me, and I differentiated the senses as they brought me information, and counted them up, and now in the broad wealth of memory some things I handled, others I hid away, and yet others I forced to the fore. Nor was I myself when I was doing all this (which is to say the ability which enabled me to act) nor were you that ability of mine, for you are everlasting Light, and I asked your guidance on everything—what existed, what things were, what they were worth: and I listened as you taught me and laid commands upon me. I often do this, for it brings me pleasure, and whenever I have time to myself, I abandon matters of business and have recourse to that pleasure. I consult you on every matter in which I busy myself, and I find that there is no safe place for my soul except in you; you bind my shattered self together, and no part of me can fall away from you.</p>
