<p>(28) All these things are lovely with you as their Maker, and look!—you have made all things, and you are indescribably lovelier. If Adam had not fallen away from you, the bitter brine of the sea would not have poured forth from his womb;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_383_72" id="target_note_LCL027_383_72"><sup>72</sup></a> that is, the human race—so insistently inquisitive, so vehemently proud, so fickle and so lax. <span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 4:1</span>Thus there would be no need for your ministers to perform the actions and words of the sacrament <span class="marginNote right">Sg 8:7</span>in many waters both physically and perceptibly. This is what I would take the reptiles and birds to stand for, because even human beings washed and initiated, and having submitted to the physical signs of the sacraments, would be unable to go further unless their souls began to grow in the Spirit on a different level after the words of initiation, <span class="marginNote right">Hb 6:1</span>and turned their gaze toward their perfecting.</p>

(29) By your Word, then, it was not the depth of the sea but the earth, separated from the bitterness of the waters, that cast forth not a <span class="marginNote right">Gn 1:24</span>multiplicity of creatures alive and crawling or flying, but a single living soul. It no longer has the same need of baptism as the pagans do, and as it did itself when it was beneath the waters. For there is no other way in to the kingdom of heaven since the time when <span class="marginNote right">Jn 3:5</span>you established baptism as the means of entry; and it seeks no mighty wonders to bring it to faith. <span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 1:22</span>Nor does this living soul fail to believe without seeing signs and marvels; it is already believing earth,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_383_73" id="target_note_LCL027_383_73"><sup>73</sup></a> separate from the waters of the sea, which are bitter faithlessness. <span class="marginNote right">1 Cor 14:22</span>Likewise tongues are for a sign to unbelievers, not believers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_383_74" id="target_note_LCL027_383_74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
