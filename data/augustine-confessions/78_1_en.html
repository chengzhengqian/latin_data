Blessed are those who love you<span class="marginNote right">Tb 13:14</span>, and love their friend in you and their enemy because of you<span class="marginNote right">cf. Mt 5:44; Lk 6:27</span>. Only those who hold everyone dear, in the One who can never be lost, never lose anyone dear to them. And who is that One if not our God, who made heaven and earth and who fills them<span class="marginNote right">Jer 23:24</span>, because by filling them he has created them? No one loses you unless they reject you; and because they reject you where can they go or flee<span class="marginNote right">Ps 139:7</span> except away from a kindly you to an angry you!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_157_37" id="target_note_LCL026_157_37"><sup>37</sup></a> Surely they find your law is everywhere in their own punishment? And your law is truth<span class="marginNote right">Ps 119:142</span> and you are Truth.</p>
<p>10. (15) O God of hosts, turn us and show us your face, and we shall be whole<span class="marginNote right">Ps 80:7</span>. For wherever a person’s soul turns, everywhere it is pierced with enduring pains except in you—even if it is stuck in things which are beautiful but are separate from you, and separate from that soul itself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_157_38" id="target_note_LCL026_157_38"><sup>38</sup></a> Yet those things of beauty would be nothing unless they were from you. They arise and pass away;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_157_39" id="target_note_LCL026_157_39"><sup>39</sup></a> and in arising they begin to exist, so to speak; and they grow so that they may reach perfection; and once they are perfected they grow old and perish. And although not everything grows old, still all things perish. So when things arise and strive for existence, the faster they grow into being, they more they hasten toward annihilation: this is their nature. This much you have allowed them because they are parts of things that do not all exist at the same time, but that, by withdrawing and following on, all make up the whole universe of which they are part. In this way human speech also is accomplished by means of sounding signs: for a speech cannot be completed unless one word ceases to sound once it has uttered its syllables, so that another may take its place.</p>
