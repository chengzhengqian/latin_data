to me, “How do you know?” I would reply that I know because we take measurements, and we cannot measure something that does not exist, and past and future do not exist. How do we measure the present time, since it has no magnitude? It can be measured when it goes past, but once it has gone past it cannot be measured: there will be nothing then existing to be measured. But when it is measured, where does it come from? and by what way? and where is it headed? Where is it from if not the future? By what way if not the present? Where is it headed if not the past? It comes from what does not yet exist, it traverses what has no magnitude, and heads for what no longer exists. What are we measuring, then, if not time which has some spatial dimension? We only speak of single and double and triple and equal times (and anything else we say about time) if we mean passages of time. So in what length of time do we measure passing time? Should it be in the future it came from before it passed away? But because it no longer exists, we do not measure what has no magnitude. What about the past, then, into which it lapses? But we do not measure what no longer exists.</p>

Who shall I ask about these matters? To whom shall I confess my ignorance to good effect if not to you? For you never find the force of my burning enthusiasm for your Scriptures tiresome. Grant what I love; for I do love, and that capacity in me is your gift. Grant me this, O Father, <span class="marginNote right">Mt 7:11</span>for
