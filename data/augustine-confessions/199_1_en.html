<p>(23) For if there are as many contrary natures as there are wills to resist you, there will no longer be two kinds, but instead they will be a multiplicity. If someone were to make a decision whether to go to the theater or to the Manichaean assembly, those Manichaeans cry out, “Look, that’s the two natures! The good one leads in this direction, the other, which is evil, leads back in that direction: where else does that hesitation between conflicting wills in a person come from?” But I declare that both of them are evil: both the one which takes them one way, to the assembly, and the other which takes them another way, to the theater. They, however, will only believe that the way which leads to their assembly is good.</p>
<p>So what if some catholic Christian were to be hesitating and vacillating internally, as the two wills came into conflict, whether he should go to the theater or instead to our church? Surely those Manichaeans will be vacillating as to what they should reply? Either they will admit what they do not want to, that it is a good will which makes people go to our church (as, for example, those who have been steeped in her sacraments and remained involved there); or they must think that there are <span class="italic">two</span> evil natures and <span class="italic">two</span> evil minds in conflict in a single human being,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_399_46" id="target_note_LCL026_399_46"><sup>46</sup></a> so what they usually say (that there is one good and one evil nature) will not be true; or they will be converted to the truth and will stop denying that when a person is hesitating between two courses of action, one soul can be wavering between conflicting wills.</p>
