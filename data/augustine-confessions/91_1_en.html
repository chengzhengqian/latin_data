How much of an obstacle to your little ones were their far slower wits, when they did not stray far from you, so that instead, like fledglings, they could come into pin safe in the nest of your Church, and nurture their wings of love with the nourishment of a sound faith?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_183_77" id="target_note_LCL026_183_77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>O Lord our God, let us put our hope in the covering of your wings<span class="marginNote right">Ps 17:8, etc.</span>: protect us and carry us. You will bear us up when we are little, and you will keep on bearing us right up into old age<span class="marginNote right">Is 46:4</span>, for when you are our firm foundation, then it is a foundation indeed; while when it is our own, it is no firm foundation at all. Our good dwells ever with you, and because we are diverted from it, we instead become perverted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_183_78" id="target_note_LCL026_183_78"><sup>78</sup></a> Let us return, Lord, so as not to be overturned,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_183_79" id="target_note_LCL026_183_79"><sup>79</sup></a> for our unblemished good abides with you; for you yourself are that good, so we are not afraid that we have nowhere to return, just because we once broke away. Even while we were away our house has not fallen into decay, for it is your eternity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_183_80" id="target_note_LCL026_183_80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
