then, to stop us forgetting what we do forget, when it is present.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_111_51" id="target_note_LCL027_111_51"><sup>51</sup></a> Or perhaps we are to understand from this that forgetfulness is not of itself present in the memory when we remember it, but only through its impression, because if forgetfulness were present in actual reality, it would have the effect of making us forget, not remember. Finally, who will inquire into this? Who will reach an understanding of how this can be?</p>
<p>(25) I am really struggling over this, Lord, and struggling with myself. To myself I have become a land which is too unyielding, <span class="marginNote right">cf. Gn 3:17-18</span>demanding too much sweat. We do not now examine the heavenly regions,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_111_52" id="target_note_LCL027_111_52"><sup>52</sup></a> or measure out the distance between the stars or inquire into the weight of the earth. I am a creature who remembers, I am a mind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_111_53" id="target_note_LCL027_111_53"><sup>53</sup></a> It is not surprising, then, if whatever I am not is separate from me: after all, what is closer to me than my own self? Look! The power of my memory is something I do not understand, because without it I cannot even refer to myself. So what shall I say, given that it is clear to me that I remember forgetfulness? Shall I say that the thing that I remember is not in my memory? Or shall I say that forgetfulness abides in my memory so that I do not forget it? Both answers are ridiculous. What of the third option? How can I say that an impression of forgetfulness is retained in my memory, not forgetfulness itself, when I remember it? And again, how can I say this given that when an impression of something is imprinted on my memory, the first requirement is that the thing itself must be present, so that an impression of it can be taken? For this is how I remember Carthage, and all the places I have been; this is how I remember the faces of people I have seen,
