But you had already laid the foundations of your temple in my mother’s breast, and the beginning of your holy habitation<span class="marginNote right">Eccl 24:14</span>, for my father was still just a catechumen,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL026_69_16" id="target_note_LCL026_69_16"><sup>16</sup></a> and even that was only recent.
