<p>11. (11) Now, Lord, your voice sounds strongly to my inward ear, telling me that <span class="marginNote right">1 Tm 6:16</span>you are eternal, that you alone have immortality, because you are not changed by any kind of shape or movement, and your will is not modified over time—for no will is immortal that is first one thing, then another. In your sight this is clear to me; let it grow ever clearer, more and more, I beg you; and when it is discloses itself I shall remain steadfast and vigilant beneath your wings.</p>
<p>Yes, Lord, your voice has sounded strongly to my inner ear, telling me that you are the maker of all the natural beings and substances that are not the same as you and yet exist: the only things that do not derive from you are those that are nonexistent. Our movements of will away from you (who are existent) toward lesser objects are, by virtue of that movement from good to bad, failings and sins.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_275_21" id="target_note_LCL027_275_21"><sup>21</sup></a> Yet no one’s sin either harms you or discomposes the orderliness
