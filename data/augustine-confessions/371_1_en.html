chest) or silver (to make a vessel). Such materials as these are undoubtedly temporally prior to the shaped forms of things which are made from them. But with song, it is not so. When singing happens, the sound of it is heard; there is not an unstructured noise first from which a song is then constructed. Whatever makes a sound first, passes away; and you will not find anything of it left for you to recover and use your skill to make into a composition.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_329_76" id="target_note_LCL027_329_76"><sup>76</sup></a> And so song consists in its own sound, and that sound is the matter of which the song consists. Indeed that matter is given shape, to create song. And so, as I was saying, the matter of sound comes before the structure of song. It is not prior by virtue of its capacity for creativity; for sound is not the author of the singing. It is provided by the body to the soul doing the singing, from which it creates song: but it is not prior in time: for it is produced at the same time as the song. Nor is it prior in terms of choice: for sound is not more powerful than song, because song is not just sound, but rather sound beautifully structured. It is, however, prior in terms of origin because song is not formed into sound, but sound is formed into song.</p>
<p>By this example, let anyone who is able understand that primal matter was first made and called “heaven” and “earth,” because from it heaven and earth were made; but this matter was not made first in temporal priority, because it is the shapes of things that give rise to the phenomenon of time,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_329_77" id="target_note_LCL027_329_77"><sup>77</sup></a> whereas matter was without shape; but now that time exists, both are discernible at the same time. Still nothing can be reported concerning this kind of matter without making it seem to be prior in time; even though it is given a lower<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL027_329_78" id="target_note_LCL027_329_78"><sup>78</sup></a> value—because anything that has a shape is definitely better than something without
