city you could not require arbitration for excluding rain-water, since the whole matter applies rather <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">44</span><span class="br"></span>to country property.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_415_a" id="target_note_LCL386_415_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Under the same topic of similarity comes also the citing of examples or parallel cases, as Crassus in his defence of Curius cited many cases of men who, having been named as heirs in the event that a son was born within ten months and died before attaining his majority, would have taken the inheritance. Such a citation of parallel cases carried the day, and you jurists make frequent <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span>use of it in your responses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_415_ba" id="target_note_LCL386_415_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> In fact fictitious examples of similarity have their value, but they belong to oratory rather than to jurisprudence, although even you are wont to use them, but in the following way: Suppose some one has conveyed property by mancipation which cannot be so conveyed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_415_c" id="target_note_LCL386_415_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Does it therefore become the property of the one who has accepted it? Or has the one who has conveyed by mancipation in any way obligated himself by that act? Under this topic of similarity orators and philosophers have licence to cause dumb things to talk, to call on the dead to rise from the world below, to tell of something which could not possibly happen, in order to add force to an argument or lessen it: this is called ὑπερβολή (hyperbole). And they do many other strange things; but they have a wider field. Nevertheless, as I said above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_415_d" id="target_note_LCL386_415_d"><sup>d</sup></a> whether the question be important or trifling, the arguments for it are derived from the same topics.</p>
