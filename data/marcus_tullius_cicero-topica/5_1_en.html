But this class has many subdivisions. For we call some arguments “conjugate,” others we derive from genus, species, similarity, difference, contraries, adjuncts, antecedents, consequents, contradictions, cause, effect, and comparison with events of greater, less or equal importance.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span><p>“Conjugate” is the term applied to arguments based on words of the same family. Words of the same family are those which are formed from one root but have different grammatical forms, as <span class="italic">wise, wisely, wisdom.</span> Such a “conjugation” of words is called συζυγία (syzygy), and yields an argument of this sort: If a field is “common” (<span class="italic">compascuus</span>), it is legal to use it as a common pasture (<span class="italic">compascere</span>).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_391_aa" id="target_note_LCL386_391_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

For the species is never separated from its genus, as long as it keeps its proper name; coin keeps the name of silver; therefore it seems to have been included in the legacy.</p>
