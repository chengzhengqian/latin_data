For instance, sometimes the defence is made that the law does not say what the opponent tries to make it say, but something different. This occurs when the law is ambiguous, so that two different meanings can be got out of it. Again, the intent of the author is shown to be opposed to the letter of the law, so that the question is raised whether words or meaning should prevail. Again, a law is cited which conflicts with the law under discussion. These are the three situations which can raise a controversy over any written document; ambiguity, variance between the letter and the intent, and conflicting documents.</p>

The narratives must receive similar treatment in order that they may look to their goal, which is to be plain, brief, clear, credible, restrained and dignified.
