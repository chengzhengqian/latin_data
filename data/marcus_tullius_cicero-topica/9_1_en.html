<p>First of all, then let us take up definition itself. A definition is a statement which explains what the thing defined is. Of definitions there are two prime classes, one defining things that exist, and the other, things which are apprehended only by the
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span>mind. By things that exist I mean such as can be seen and touched: for example, farm, house, wall, rain-water, slave, animal, furniture, food, etc.; sometimes you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_399_b" id="target_note_LCL386_399_b"><sup>b</sup></a> have to define objects of this class. On the other hand, by things which do not exist I mean those which cannot be touched or pointed out, but can, for all that, be perceived by the mind and comprehended; for example, you might define acquisition by long possession, guardianship, <span class="italic">gens,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_399_c" id="target_note_LCL386_399_c"><sup>c</sup></a></span>
