was a discussion of shores, which you jurists claim are all public property, and those who were interested in the matter asked what a shore was, he was accustomed to define it as the place upon which the waves play.

But if you were enumerating the formulas for contracts and actions, it is not wrong to pass over something in a class which is indefinitely large. But the same procedure is faulty in an analysis. For there is a fixed number of species which are included in each genus. But a division into parts is more indefinite, like drawing <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span>streams of water from a fountain. And so in text-books of rhetoric when the genus “quaestio” (subject for debate) is under discussion, there is added a precise statement of the number of its species.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_407_a" id="target_note_LCL386_407_a"><sup>a</sup></a> But the same method is not used when rules are being given about the figures of style and thought which they call σχήματα (schemata), for there is no limit to this subject. From this, too, it may be plain what distinction we wish to make between enumeration and analysis. For although the words seemed to mean almost the same, it was desired that the names of the processes should differ, because the processes were distinct.</p>
