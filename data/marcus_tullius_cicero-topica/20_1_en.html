Since, as I have said, this topic is divided into three parts—consequence, antecedence and contradiction—the topic is single as far as concerns the discovery of arguments, but the treatment is threefold. For what difference does it make in which way you draw a conclusion in this assumed case—that a woman who has received as a bequest “all the silver,” is entitled to the coin?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_421_b" id="target_note_LCL386_421_b"><sup>b</sup></a> You may do it in this way: If coined money is silver, it was bequeathed to the woman.

The logicians give the name of “first form of conclusion” to this way of concluding an argument, in which when you have assumed the first statement, that which is connected
