property. Add the following: which comes to some one at the death of another. It is not yet a definition; for the property of the dead can be held in many ways without inheritance. Add one word, “legally.” By now the thing will seem to be separated from those with which it shares qualities in common, so that the definition has been developed as follows: An inheritance is property which has come to one legally at the death of another. It is still not satisfactory.
