From antecedents: If a divorce occurs through an offence by the husband, although the woman has sent the letter of divorcement, still no part of the dowry should be left for the children.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_395_b" id="target_note_LCL386_395_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span><p>From consequents: If a woman, married to a man with whom she does not have <span class="italic">conubium</span> (right of marriage), has divorced him, inasmuch as the children who have been born do not follow the father, no part of the dowry should be left for the children.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span><p>From contradictions: If a <span class="italic">pater familias</span> has bequeathed to his wife the usufruct of maid-servants as a proviso in naming his son as heir, and has made no such proviso in naming a reversionary heir, on the death of the son the woman will not lose her usufruct. For what has once been given to some one by will cannot be taken from him to whom it has been given without his consent. For “receiving legally” and “surrendering unwillingly” are contradictory.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span><p>From efficient causes in this way: Anyone has a right to build a wall to touch a party wall at a right angle; and this new wall may be either solid or resting on arches. But a man who has given guarantees against eventual damage in demolishing a party wall will not be bound to make good the loss which is caused by an arch. For the damage was not caused by any fault of the man who demolished the party wall, but by a defect in building the arch which was so constructed that it could not be supported (without the party wall).</p>
