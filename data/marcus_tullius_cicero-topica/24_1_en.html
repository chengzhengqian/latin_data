which something is not effected often gives rise to confusion. For example, if there cannot be sons without parents, it does not follow that there was in the parents a necessary cause of procreation.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">61</span><span class="br"></span><p>This cause without which something does not occur must, therefore, be carefully distinguished from that by which something surely occurs. The former may be illustrated by the line:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Would that ne’er in Pelion’s grove<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_429_a" id="target_note_LCL386_429_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">For unless “the beams of fir had fallen to earth,” the Argo would not have been built; yet there was no inevitable efficient power in the beams. But when “the fiery bolt cutting a wavy furrow fell on the ship of Ajax,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_429_b" id="target_note_LCL386_429_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the ship is inevitably set on fire.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">62</span><span class="br"></span><p>There is a further difference in causes in that some effect their own work as it were without any eagerness of mind, without desire, without opinion; for instance, the rule that everything that is born must die. Others work through desire, or mental agitation, or disposition, or nature, or art, or accident: by desire, as in your case when you read this book; by agitation, as when some one might dread the outcome of the present crisis; by disposition, as when one is easily or quickly moved to anger; by nature, for instance it comes about that a vice grows day by day; by art that one should paint well; by accident, that one should have a successful voyage. None of these events is without its cause, nor for that matter is anything at all; but causes of this nature are not inevitable.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">63</span><span class="br"></span><p>Looking at all causes we find that in some there is uniformity of operation, and not in others. There is uniformity in nature and art, but none in the rest.</p>
