Greeks call εἴδη (eidê), and Latin authors who have happened to treat of the subject call <span class="italic">species,</span> not a bad translation, to be sure, but inconvenient if we wish to use different cases of the word in a sentence. For even if Latin usage allowed, I should be unwilling to say <span class="italic">specierum</span> (genitive plural) or <span class="italic">speciebus</span> (dative or ablative plural). Still we often have to use these cases. But I should prefer <span class="italic">formis</span> and <span class="italic">formarum.</span> Since, however, either word has the same meaning, I think one should not fail to use the convenient word.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_405_a" id="target_note_LCL386_405_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

By concept I mean what the Greeks call now ἔννοια (ennoia), now πρόληψις (prolepsis). This is an innate knowledge of anything, which has been previously apprehended, and needs to be unfolded.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_405_b" id="target_note_LCL386_405_b"><sup>b</sup></a> The species are the classes into which the genus is divided without omitting anything, as, for example, if one should divide jurisprudence into statutes, custom, and equity. If anyone thinks that species are the same as parts, he brings confusion into the subject, and misled by a casual resemblance fails to distinguish sharply enough between things which <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span>must be separated. Orators and poets often go so far as to define by comparison, using metaphors with a pleasing effect. But I, unless forced to do so, will not use any examples except those supplied by you jurisconsults. A case in point is Aquilius, my colleague and intimate friend.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_405_c" id="target_note_LCL386_405_c"><sup>c</sup></a> When there
