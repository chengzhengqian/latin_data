Every systematic treatment of argumentation has two branches, one concerned with invention of arguments and the other with judgement of their validity; Aristotle was the founder of both in my opinion. The Stoics have worked in only one of the two fields. That is to say, they have followed diligently the ways of judgement by means of the science which they call διαλεκτική (dialectic), but they have totally neglected the art which is called τοπική (topics), an art which is both more useful <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>and certainly prior in the order of nature. For my part, I shall begin with the earlier, since both are useful in the highest degree, and I intend to follow up both, if I have leisure. A comparison may help: It is easy to find things that are hidden if the hiding place is pointed out and marked; similarly if we wish to track down some argument we ought to know the places or topics: for that is the name given by Aristotle to the “regions”, as it were, from <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>which arguments are drawn. Accordingly, we may define a topic as the region of an argument, and an argument as a course of reasoning which firmly establishes a matter about which there is some doubt.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_387_ba" id="target_note_LCL386_387_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>Of the topics under which arguments are included, some are inherent in the very nature of the subject which is under discussion, and others are brought in from without. Inherent in the nature of the subject are arguments derived from the whole, from its parts, from its meaning, and from the things which are in some way closely connected with the
