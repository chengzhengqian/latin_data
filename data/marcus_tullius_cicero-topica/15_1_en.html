Next comes the topic embracing circumstances which are in one way or another closely connected with the subject under inquiry. As stated above<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_411_b" id="target_note_LCL386_411_b"><sup>b</sup></a> this has many subdivisions. The first of these is “conjugation” (words etymologically related), which is called συζυγία (syzygia) by the Greeks, and is near akin to etymology, which we discussed a moment ago. For example, if we were defining rain-water as only that which we see collect from showers, Mucius would come to argue that because rain-water (<span class="italic">pluvia</span>) and rain (<span class="italic">pluere</span>) are “conjugate” words, all water which has risen because of rain should be excluded (from a neighbour’s property).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_411_c" id="target_note_LCL386_411_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>

Frequently one may stop short of that point, provided that what is assumed as a genus is higher than what is subsumed under it. For example, rain-water in the last analysis is water which falls from heaven and is increased by showers, but on a nearer analysis (and the legal principle of excluding rainwater depends on this) the genus is harmful rain-water. Of this there are two species: one which does damage because of a fault in the land,
