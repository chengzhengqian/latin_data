This kind of argumentation has doubtless a relation to your discussions when you give answers on legal problems, but it more closely concerns the philosophers, who share with orators that method of drawing a conclusion from contradictory statements which the logicians call the third form, and the teachers of rhetoric, the ἐνθύμημα (enthymema). There are several other methods used by the logicians, which consist of propositions disjunctively connected: Either this or that is true; but this <span class="italic">is</span> true, therefore that is not. Similarly, either this or that is true; but this is not, therefore that <span class="italic">is</span> true. These conclusions are valid because in a disjunctive statement <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">57</span><span class="br"></span>not more than one half can be true. Of the conclusions given above, the former is called by the logicians the fourth method and the latter, the fifth. Then they add a denial of the possibility of two statements being conjoined, thus: This and that are not both true; but this <span class="italic">is</span>, therefore that is not. This is the sixth form. The seventh is: This and that are not both true; this is not, therefore that is. From these forms innumerable conclusions are derived; in fact almost the whole of διαλεκτική (dialectice) consists of this. But not even those which I have explained are necessary for this treatise.</p>
