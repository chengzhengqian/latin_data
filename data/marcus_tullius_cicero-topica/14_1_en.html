<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span><p>Many arguments are derived from <span class="italic">notatio</span> (etymology). This is what is used when an argument is developed out of the meaning of a word. The Greeks call this ἐτυμολογία (etymologia), and this translated word for word would be in Latin <span class="italic">veriloquium</span> (veriloquence). But to avoid using a new word that is not very suitable, we call this kind <span class="italic">notatio</span>, because words are tokens (<span class="italic">notae</span>) of things. So Aristotle uses σύμβολον (symbolon) for the idea represented by the Latin <span class="italic">nota.</span> But when the meaning is clear, we need not be so particular about the word <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span>which expresses it. In debate, as I have said, many arguments are developed from a word by etymology. An example would be the question as to the meaning of <span class="italic">postliminium (reverter</span> or return to one’s former status)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_409_a" id="target_note_LCL386_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—I do not mean what things are subject to <span class="italic">postliminium,</span> for that would be a case for analysis, somewhat as follows: By the right of <span class="italic">postliminium,</span> the following return home: man, ship, pack-mule, stallion, mare which is customarily used with bridle;—but when the meaning of the term <span class="italic">postliminium</span> is sought, and etymology is applied to the word itself. In this connexion our friend Servius, I think,holds that <span class="italic">post</span> is the only part which determines the meaning, and will have it that <span class="italic">-liminium</span> is merely a formative suffix, as in <span class="italic">finitimus</span> (neighbour), <span class="italic">legitimus</span> (lawful), <span class="italic">aeditimus</span> (attendant in a temple), the ending <span class="italic">-timus</span> has no more meaning than <span class="italic">-tullium</span> in <span class="italic">meditullium</span> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">37</span><span class="br"></span>(middle).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_409_b" id="target_note_LCL386_409_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But Scaevola, the son of Publius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_409_c" id="target_note_LCL386_409_c"><sup>c</sup></a> regards it as a compound word, the component parts being <span class="italic">post</span> (behind or after) and <span class="italic">limen</span> (threshold); as property of which we have lost control on its passing into the power of the enemy has departed, as it were, from its own threshold, hence when it returns
