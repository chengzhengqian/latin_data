topics are better suited to some inquiries than to others. There are two kinds of inquiry, one general and the other particular. The particular is what the Greeks call ὑπόθεσις (hypothesis), and we call cause or case; the general inquiry is what they call <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span>θέσις (thesis), and we can call proposition. The hallmark of a case is that it involves definite persons, places, times, actions, or affairs, either all or most of these; a proposition involves one or several of these, but not the most important. Therefore a proposition is a part of a case. But every inquiry concerns some one of the subjects of which cases consist, that is, it concerns one or more or sometimes all of them.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">81</span><span class="br"></span><p>Inquiries “about any possible subject” (<span class="italic">i.e</span>. general inquiries) are of two kinds: one theoretical, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">82</span><span class="br"></span>the other practical. Theoretical inquiries are those of which the purpose is knowledge: for example, one may inquire whether law has its origin in nature or in some agreement and contract between men. The following is an example of the practical inquiry: Should a philosopher take part in politics? Theoretical questions fall into three groups; the question asked is either, Does it exist? or What is it? or What is its character?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_445_a" id="target_note_LCL386_445_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The first of these is treated and answered by inference and conjecture, the second by definition, and the third by distinguishing between right and wrong.</p>
<p>There are four ways of dealing with conjecture or inference: the question is asked, first whether anything exists or is true; second, what its origin is; third, what cause produced it; fourth, what changes can be made in anything. As to existence, as follows: Is there really any such thing as honour
