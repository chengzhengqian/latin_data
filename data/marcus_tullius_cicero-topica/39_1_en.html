Though these qualities should prevail throughout the whole speech, they are more characteristic of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">98</span><span class="br"></span>the narrative. The division of a speech which follows the narrative is the proof. Since this is accomplished by persuasion, this subject—that is the topics which are especially important for persuasion—has been covered in what was said about the whole theory of oratory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_459_a" id="target_note_LCL386_459_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The peroration among other topics makes especial use of amplification; the effect of this should be to excite the spirits of the audience or calm them, and if they have already been so affected, to heighten their feelings or quiet them <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">99</span><span class="br"></span>still more. Rules for this division of a speech, in which pity, anger, hatred, envy and other emotions are aroused, are given in other books, which you can read with me when you wish. But for the object which you had in mind, this should be enough <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">100</span><span class="br"></span>and more than enough to satisfy your desires. For in order not to omit anything which had to do with the discovery of arguments in any fashion, I have included more than you requested, and have done what liberal sellers are wont to do; when they sell a house or farm, reserving title to minerals and timber,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_459_b" id="target_note_LCL386_459_b"><sup>b</sup></a> they make a concession to the buyer and allow him to keep something which seems to be put in the right spot as an ornament.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_459_c" id="target_note_LCL386_459_c"><sup>c</sup></a> So in addition to what we were bound to sell you, as it were, we wished to give you some ornaments not called for in the contract.</p>
