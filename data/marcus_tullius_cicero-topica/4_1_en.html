subject which is being investigated. Arguments from external circumstances are those that are removed and widely separated from the subject.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span><p>Sometimes a definition is applied to the whole subject which is under consideration; this definition unfolds what is wrapped up, as it were, in the subject which is being examined. The following is the pattern of such an argument: The civil law is a system of equity established between members of the same state for the purpose of securing to each his property rights; the knowledge of this system of equity is useful; therefore the science of civil <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>law is useful. Sometimes there is an enumeration of parts, and this is handled in the following manner: So-and-So is not a free man unless he has been set free by entry in the census roll, or by touching with the rod, or by will.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_389_a" id="target_note_LCL386_389_a"><sup>a</sup></a> None of these conditions has been fulfilled, therefore he is not free. Then etymology may be employed, when some argument is derived from the force or meaning of a word, in this fashion: Since the law provides that an <span class="italic">assiduus</span> (tax-payer or freeholder) shall be <span class="italic">vindex</span> (representative) for an <span class="italic">assidmis,</span> it provides that a rich man be representative for a rich man; for that is the meaning of <span class="italic">assiduus,</span> it being derived, as Aelius says, from <span class="italic">aere dando</span> (paying money).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL386_389_ba" id="target_note_LCL386_389_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

The etymology is wrong, but was the one commonly accepted at the time; <span class="italic">assidui</span> (tax-payers or freeholders) were contrasted in early times with <span class="italic">proletarii</span>.<span class="linebreak"></span>
The Aelius who is quoted as the authority for this etymology is probably Lucius Aelius Stilo Praeconinus, a noted grammarian and rhetorician, and one of Cicero’s teachers; or he may be the jurist Sextus Aelius Paetus Catus, consul 198 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> who wrote a commentary on the Twelve Tables.<span class="linebreak"></span>
The law involved is explained in the following quotation from Buckland, <span class="italic">A Text-Book of Roman Law from Augustus to Justinian,</span> 2nd ed., p. 618 f., describing the procedure for collecting a judgement. “The process was as follows: after 30 days from the judgement or other event justifying the seizure, the claimant brought the party liable before the magistrate. . . . The defendant might not defend himself against the <span class="italic">manus iniectio</span>, but if he claimed that it was not justified, some one must appear on his behalf to prove this—a <span class="italic">vindex.</span> The effect of the intervention was that the defendant was released, and further proceedings were against the <span class="italic">vindex.” Cf.</span> also, Bruns, <span class="italic">Fontes Iuris Romani,</span> 7th ed., p. 18.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL386_389_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
