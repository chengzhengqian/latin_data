riddled with hatreds and with feuds, out of which
arise civil wars. So do not wish for the impossible, and, by
the immortal gods, Members of the Senate, beware of losing
a lasting peace in the hope of an immediate peace.</p>

not yet know what the envoys have achieved. But in spirit
we should already be aroused, on the alert, ready, armed,
so as not to be taken in by some soothing, pleading words
or a pretense of fair play. He must have carried out all the
restrictions and orders that have been imposed on him before
he can make any request: given up attacking Brutus
and his army and ravaging the towns and territory of the
province of Gaul; allowed the envoys access to Brutus;
withdrawn his army to this side of the river Rubicon and
not have brought it within two hundred miles of the city;
submitted to the control of both the senate and people of
Rome. If he does these things, then we shall be free to deliberate;
if he does not obey the senate, he will have declared
war upon the Roman people, not the senate upon
him.</p>
<p>But I warn you, Members of the Senate: what is at stake<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span>
is the freedom of the Roman people, which has been entrusted
to your charge; likewise the lives and possessions of
the very best men, long menaced by Antonius’ insatiable
greed combined with savage cruelty; and also your authority,
which you will totally lose unless you hold it firmly now.
Be sure you do not let this evil and destructive monster
loose from the toils that confine him. Pansa, let me warn
you personally—not that a man of your sagacity needs
counsel, but even the best helmsmen are often advised by
passengers in great tempests—do not let all the fine, extensive
preparations you have made fall away to nothing.
