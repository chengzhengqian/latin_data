meeting with one heart and voice, and they declared
their passionate desire to regain freedom.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_23_16" id="target_note_LCL507_23_16"><sup>16</sup></a> Hence, while
formerly we could only pray to have the Roman people at
our side, now we have them to lead us. So what hope exists
that the men who are besieging Mutina, attacking an imperator
of the Roman people and his army can be at peace
with the Roman people? Will there be peace with the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span>
towns of Italy, who have shown such great zeal in passing
decrees, providing soldiers, and promising money that in
no single town do you feel the absence of the Roman peopleâ€™s
senate? The men of Firmum, who took the lead in
promising money, should be commended by a resolution
of this body. The Marrucini, who decreed that any dodgers
of military service should be marked by public infamy, deserve
an honorific acknowledgment. Such things are now
happening throughout Italy. A fine peace Antonius will
have with them and they with him! What strife can be
sharper? And peace in the community cannot possibly exist
amid strife.</p>

Lucius Visidius, an eminently substantial and respectable

watch and vigil over my life when I was consul. He has
urged his neighbors not only to enlist in the army but even
given them subsidies of his own pocket. I say again: can
Antonius be at peace with such a man as this, a man whom
we ought to commend in a senatorial decree? Or can he
be with Gaius Caesar, who banned him from the city, or
Decimus Brutus, who banned him from Gaul? As for the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>
province of Gaul, which has excluded and repudiated him,
will he himself calm and soothe his wrath toward it? Unless
you take care, Members of the Senate, you will see everything
