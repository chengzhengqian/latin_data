wisdom have been challenged by a political storm involving
a most terrifying crisis. Now a consulship comes into
the limelight when it guides the Republic, at a crucial,

Senate, has ever been more crucial than the present.</p>

<p>[3] Therefore, I am a man who has always been an advocate
of peace, and although all decent men desire peace,
especially peace between fellow countrymen, I have desired
it more than most. My round of activity has always
been worked out in the Forum, in the senate-house, in
warding off danger from friends; that is how I have won the
highest honors, moderate wealth, and any prestige I may
enjoy. Therefore, I, a foster child of peace so to speak, who,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>
however great I am(I make no arrogant claims for myself),
certainly should not have been what I am without peace in
the community—I speak at my peril, Members of the Senate,
and I tremble to think how you are going to receive
this; but I beg and beseech you, Members of the Senate,
bearing in mind my unflagging zeal for the maintenance
and enhancement of your prestige, first of all to receive
what I am about to say without offense and not to repudiate
it until I have explained its meaning, even though the
words grate upon your ears and you can scarcely believe
they are Marcus Cicero’s: I, a constant encomiast and advocate
of peace (I shall state that repeatedly), am against
peace with Marcus Antonius. I enter upon the rest of my
speech with high hope, Members of the Senate, inasmuch
as I have passed the most dangerous point without a sound
of protest. Why, then, am I against peace? Because it is dishonorable,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>
because it is dangerous, because it is impossible.
And while I explain these three points, Members of
the Senate, I ask you to listen to my words with your customary
benevolence.</p>
