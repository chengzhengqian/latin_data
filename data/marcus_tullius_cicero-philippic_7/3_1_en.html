Republic? As you know, I have always opposed the capriciousness
of the crowd, but this splendid cause has made a
“people’s man” of me. And these men are called consulars,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
or rather that is what they call themselves: nobody deserves
that name unless he can support the burden of so
great an honor. Are you,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_9_4" id="target_note_LCL507_9_4"><sup>4</sup></a> sir, to back the enemy? Is he to
send you letters about his hopes of success? Are you to produce
