<p>Is anything more dishonorable not only to individuals
but especially to the entire senate than inconsistency, irresponsibility,
fickleness? And could anything be more inconsistent
than suddenly to want peace made with a man
whom in many recent decrees you have declared a public
enemy, not in word but in substance?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_13_6" id="target_note_LCL507_13_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Or did you not declare<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>
Antonius an enemy when you conferred upon Gaius
Caesar honors that were, to be sure, his right and due, but
nonetheless extraordinary and everlasting, solely in recognition
of the fact he had raised an army against Marcus
Antonius? And did you not declare Antonius an enemy
when the veteran soldiers who had followed Gaius Caesar
were commended by your authority? Did you not declare
Antonius an enemy when you promised exemptions from
military service, money, and lands to the very brave legions
because they had abandoned him who was called a consul,

ample terms you commended Brutus, who was destined,
as it were, by his family and name to be born to liberate the
Republic, and commended his army, as they waged war
against Antonius for the freedom of the Roman people,
and commended the most faithful and loyal province of
Gaul, did you not then declare Antonius an enemy? Or,
again, when you decreed that the consuls, either or both,
should set forth to war, what war was there if Antonius was
not an enemy? What then? A very brave man, my colleague<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_13_7" id="target_note_LCL507_13_7"><sup>7</sup></a><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>
and friend, the consul Aulus Hirtius, has set out:
but how frail he was, how emaciated! Yet bodily infirmity
did not retard the strength of his spirit. I imagine he
thought it only fair to risk on behalf of the freedom of the
Roman people a life saved by the Roman people’s prayers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_13_8" id="target_note_LCL507_13_8"><sup>8</sup></a>
