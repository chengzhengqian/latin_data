lands? Who ever had all the tribes, the Roman knights, the
military tribunes, the Exchange for clients? Do you imagine
the Gracchi had greater power than this gladiator will
have? And I do not call him a gladiator as Marcus Antonius
too tends occasionally to be called a gladiator, but I do
so like those who speak plain Latin. He put up a fight in
Asia as a <span class="italic">myrmillo</span>: he equipped one of his followers, a personal

Even if these include only the people he has with him and
those who are now openly supporting him here, will there
not be enough of them, especially after the forces protecting
decent men have gone off, while those people will be
ready to move at a nod? For my part, I am afraid that if we
make a mistake in our decisions now, we shall soon see
there are too many of them.</p>

war; if we fail to wage war, peace we shall never enjoy.</p>
