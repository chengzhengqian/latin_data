thrust off; now we must wrench them away. If we cannot
do that—I shall speak as befits a senator and a Roman—let
us die. For what a dishonor to the Republic, what a disgrace,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
what a blot it will be, if Marcus Antonius gives his
opinion in this body among the ex-consuls! To say nothing
of the countless misdeeds of his consulship in the city,
during which he dissipated a vast sum of public money,
brought back exiles without a law, sold off state revenues,
removed provinces from the empire of the Roman people,
granted kingdoms for money, imposed laws on the community
by employing violence, beleaguered or excluded
the senate with arms—to say nothing, I repeat, of all this,
do you not even consider how foul a scandal it will be for
the man who has laid siege to Mutina, one of the most
staunch of the Roman people’s colonies, blockaded an imperator
of the Roman people and consul-elect, and devastated
the territory, to be readmitted to this body, which has
repeatedly declared him an enemy for these very reasons?</p>
<p>So much on the issue of dishonor. Next, as I proposed, I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>
shall speak of danger: even though it is less to be shunned
than dishonor, nevertheless it is more upsetting to the
minds of the majority of people.</p>

able to have any assurance of peace when you see Antonius,
or rather the brothers Antonii, in the community?
Perhaps you do not take Lucius seriously? I take even Gaius
seriously. But, as I see it, Lucius will direct them. For
he is patron of the thirty-five tribes, whose votes he took
