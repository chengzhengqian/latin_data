Let them repeat now ditties heard in marble theatres, now songs acted in the fashion of Nile; nor should a woman skilled as I would have her be ignorant how to hold the quill in her right hand and the lyre in her left. With his lyre did Orpheus of Rhodope move rocks and hearts, and the lakes of Tartarus and the three-headed dog.
