No awnings then hung o’er a marble theatre, nor was the platform ruddy with crocus-spray; there, artlessly arranged, were garlands which the leafy Palatine had borne; the stage was unadorned; the people sat on steps of turf, any chance leaves covering their unkempt hair. They look about them, and each notes with his glance the woman he desires, and they brood much in their secret hearts. And while to the Tuscan flute-player’s rude strains the dancer struck thrice with his foot the levelled floor, in the midst of the applause (the applause then was rough and rude) the king gave to the people the expected sign of rape. Straightway they leap forth, by their shouts betraying their eagerness, and lay lustful hand upon the maidens. As doves, most timorous of birds, flee from the eagles, as the weanling lamb from the hated wolf, so feared they the men rushing wildly on them; in none remained her former colour. For their fear was one, but not one was the appearance of their fear: some tear their hair, some sit crazed; one is silent in dismay, one calls in vain upon her mother; this one bewails, that one is struck dumb; this one remains, that one flees. The captured women are led off, spoil for the marriage-couch, and to many their very fear had power to lend grace. If any struggled overmuch and resisted her mate, up-borne on his eager breast he carried her off himself, saying: “Why do you spoil those tender eyes with tears? What your sire was to your mother that will I be to you.” Ah, Romulus, thou only didst know how to bestow bounty on thy warriors; so thou but bestow such bounty upon me, I will be a warrior. And, mark you, by hallowed custom from that time our theatres even now are fraught with danger to the fair.</p>
