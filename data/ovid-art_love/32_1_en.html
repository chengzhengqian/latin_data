A frail advantage is beauty, that grows less as time draws on, and is devoured by its own years. Violets do not bloom for ever, nor lilies open-mouthed; when the rose is perished, the hard thorn is left behind. And to thee, O handsome youth, will soon come hoary hairs, soon will come wrinkles to make furrows in your body. Now make thee a soul that will abide, and add it to thy beauty; only that endures to the ultimate pyre. Nor let it be a slight care to cultivate your mind in liberal arts, or to learn the two languages well. Ulysses was not comely, but he was eloquent; yet he fired two goddesses of the sea with love.

There was a plain” (and he draws a plain) “which we sprinkled with Dolon’s blood, while he watched and yearned for the Haemonian steeds. There were the tents ot Sithonian Rhesus; on that night I rode back on the captured horses.” More was he portraying, when a sudden wave washed Pergamus away, and the camp of Rhesus with its chief. Then said the goddess, “Those waters which thou thinkest will be favourable to thy voyage, dost see what great names they have destroyed?”</p>
