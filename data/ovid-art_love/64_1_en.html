<p>Who would believe it? women learn even how to laugh; here too seemliness is required of them. Let the mouth be but moderately opened, let the dimples on either side be small, and let the bottom of the lip cover the top of the teeth. Nor should they strain their sides with continuous laughter, but laugh with a feminine trill. One will distort her face with a hideous guffaw, another, you would think, was weeping, while doubled up with laughter. That oneâ€™s laugh has a strident and unlovely harshness, as when a mean she-ass brays by the rough millstone. How far does art not go? they learn to weep becomingly, and can wail when and how they choose. What, when they defraud letters of their rightful utterance, and the tongue is compelled to lisp at their command? If a defect has charm, they aspire to speak defectively; they learn the power to mar their power of speech. Give attention to all these things, because they are useful: learn to carry yourself with womanly step. In walk too there is no mean part of charm; it attracts or repels unknown admirers. This woman sways her side with skill, and welcomes the breeze with flowing robe, as she haughtily places her dainty steps;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_139_1" id="target_note_LCL232_139_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that one walks like the sunburnt spouse of an Umbrian lord, and takes long, straddling steps. But, as in many things, let there be moderation here; one motion is rustic, another will be more affected than is allowed. Nevertheless let the lower part of your shoulder and the upper part of your arm be bare and easily seen from the left hand. This becomes you especially, you who have snowy skins; when I see this, fain would I kiss that shoulder, wherever it is exposed.</p>
