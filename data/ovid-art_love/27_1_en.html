is shameful, none cares but for his own pleasure, and sweet is that when it springs from another’s pain. Ah, the reproach of it! no foe need a lover fear; fly those whom you deem faithful, and you will be safe.

<p>I was about to end, but various are the hearts of women; use a thousand means to waylay as many hearts. The same earth bears not everything; this soil suits vines, that olives; in that, wheat thrives. Hearts have as many fashions as the face has features; the wise man will suit himself to countless fashions, and like Proteus will now resolve himself into light waves, and now will be a lion, now a tree, now a shaggy boar. These fish are caught with spears, those with hooks; these ones are dragged with taut ropes in bulging nets. Nor let one method suit all ages; a grown hind will regard the snare from further away. Should you seem learned to the simple, or wanton to the prude, she will straightway feel a pitiful self-distrust. And so comes it that she who has feared to commit herself to an honourable lover degrades herself to the embraces of a mean one.</p>
