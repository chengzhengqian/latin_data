spoke, and from her myrtle (for she stood with myrtle binding her hair) she gave me a leaf and a few berries; as I took them I felt too their power divine, heaven shone with purer light, and my heart was relieved of all its burden. While she inspires me, seek precepts here, O women, whom propriety and the laws and your own rights permit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_123_1a" id="target_note_LCL232_123_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Now already be mindful of the old age which is to come; thus no hour will slip wasted from you. While you can, and still are in your spring-time, have your sport; for the years pass like flowing water; the wave that has gone by cannot be called back, the hour that has gone by cannot return. You must employ your time: time glides on with speedy foot, nor is that which follows so good as that which went before. These plants, now withering, I saw as violet-beds; from this thorn was a pleasing garland given me. That day will come when you, who now shut out your lovers, will lie, a cold and lonely old woman, through the night; nor will your door be broken in a nightly brawl, nor will you find your threshold strewn with roses in the morning. How quickly, ah, me! is the body furrowed by wrinkles, and the colour fled that once was in that lovely face! And the white hairs that you swear have been there since maidenhood will suddenly be scattered over all your head. Serpents put off their age with their frail skins, nor are stags made old by casting their horns: our charms flee without our aid; pluck the flower, which save it be plucked will basely wither. Besides, childbirth shortens the period of youth: a field grows old by continual harvesting.
