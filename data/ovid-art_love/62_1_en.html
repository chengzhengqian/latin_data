is first crushed that it may become a ring; the gowns you wear were once filthy wool; your jewel was rough when being shaped: now it is a noble gem, whereon naked Venus is wringing her spray-drenched
tresses.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_135_1" id="target_note_LCL232_135_1"><sup>1</sup></a> So while you are at your toilet let us think that you are asleep; it is more fitting you should be seen when the last touch has been given. Why must I know the cause of the whiteness of your cheek? Shut your chamber door: why show the unfinished work? There is much that it befits men not to know; most of your doings would offend, did you not hide them within. Look closely at the images that shine all golden in the decorated theatre, and you will think them worthless: foil covers up wood; but neither may the people come nigh them, till complete, nor save when men are absent should beauty be contrived. Yet I forbid you not to let your locks be combed before them, so that they lie rippling adown your back: at that time, especially, beware of being ill-tempered, nor often unbind your fallen tresses. Let the tiring-woman be safe; I hate her who tears with her nails her handmaid’s face, or seizing a needle stabs her arms. That maid curses, as she touches it, her mistress’ head, and weeps the while, bloodstained, over the hated locks. Let her who has poor hair set a guard at her door, or always be tired in the temple of the Good Goddess.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_135_2" id="target_note_LCL232_135_2"><sup>2</sup></a> My arrival was suddenly announced to a woman once; in confusion she put her hair on all awry. Let my foes endure a cause of shame so fearful! upon Parthian women let that dishonour fall! Ugly is a bull without horns; ugly is a field without grass, a plant without leaves, or a head without hair.</p>
