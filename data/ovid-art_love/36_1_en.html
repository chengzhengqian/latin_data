heat and the thirsty Dogstar delay you, nor a road made white by fallen snow.</p>
<p>Love is a kind of warfare; avaunt, ye laggards! these banners are not for timid men to guard. Night, storm, long journeys, cruel pains, all kinds of toil are in this dainty camp. Oft will you put up with rain from melting clouds of heaven, and oft will you lie cold on the bare ground. The Cynthian is said to have pastured the kine of Admetus king of Pherae, and to have made a humble cot his lodging. Whom does that not become which became Phoebus? put off your pride, whoever you are that care for an enduring love.

According to Plutarch (<span class="italic">Romulus</span> 29, <span class="italic">Camillus</span> 33) it was not Gauls but Latins on whom the trick was played.
