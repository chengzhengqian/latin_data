me, make the humble folk your own; let the gatekeeper ever be one of them, and him who lies before her chamber-door.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_85_1" id="target_note_LCL232_85_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Nor do I bid you give your mistress costly gifts: let them be small, but choose your small gifts cunningly and well. While lands are fertile, and your branches droop with their burden, let a slave bring rustic tributes in a basket. You can say they were sent to you from your suburban property, though you bought them in the Sacred Way. Let him bring either grapes or the chestnuts “that Amaryllis loved” but loves no more.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_85_2a" id="target_note_LCL232_85_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> Nay too by sending a thrush or a pigeon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_85_3" id="target_note_LCL232_85_3"><sup>3</sup></a> you may witness that you are mindful of your lady. Dishonourable is it when such gifts produce the hope of death and a childless old age; ah, perish they by whom gifts bear reproach!</p>
<p>Shall I bid you send tender verses also? Alas, a poem is not much honoured. Poems are praised, but costly gifts are sought; so he be wealthy, even a barbarian pleases. Now truly is the age of gold: for gold is sold many an honour, by gold is affection gained. Though you come, Homer, and all the Muses with you, if you bring nothing, Homer, out you go! Yet there are learned women too, a scanty number; and others are not learned, but wish to be so. Let either sort be praised in poems; his verses, whate’er their quality, let the reader commend by the charm of his recital; and thus to learned and unlearned the poem fashioned in their praise will perchance seem like a little gift.</p>
