entangling nets. Let the fish be held that is wounded from seizing the hook; once you assail her, press the attack, nor depart unless victorious. Then, sharing a common guilt, she will not betray you, you will know her mistress’ words and deeds. But keep her secret well; if the informer’s secret be well kept, she will always gladly foster your intimacy.</p>
<p>He errs who thinks that seasons are to be marked by sailors only, and by those who till the toilsome fields; not always must the corn be entrusted to the treacherous fields, nor always the hollow bark to the green main, nor always is it safe to angle for young girls; the same thing often goes better at the appointed season.
