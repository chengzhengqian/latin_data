A lewd pedlar will come to your mistress when in buying mood, and will spread his wares before her, while you sit by in misery; and she, that you may fancy yourself a judge, will ask you to inspect them; then she will kiss you; then she will ask you to buy. She will swear that this will satisfy her for many a long year, that she needs it now, that now is a good time to buy it. If you make excuse that you have not the cash at home she will ask for a note of handâ€”lest you should be glad you ever learned to write. What, when she claims a gift to buy, as she says, a birthday cake, and has a birthday as often as she requires? What when she weeps for a feigned loss in deepest sorrow, and pretends a jewel has slipped from the pierced lobe of her ear?

Hope, once conceived, endures for long; a treacherous goddess is she, but a timely one. Once you have given, you may be abandoned with good reason: your gift is gone, she will have taken it and lost nothing herself.
