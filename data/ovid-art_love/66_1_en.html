the wanderer, origin of lofty Rome, a work than which none more famous has appeared in Latium. Perhaps too my name will be joined to theirs, nor will my writings be given to Lethe’s waters; and someone will say, “Read the elegant poems of our master, wherein he instructs the rival parties;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_143_1" id="target_note_LCL232_143_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or from the three books marked by the title of ‘Loves’ choose out what you may softly read with docile voice; or let some Letter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_143_2" id="target_note_LCL232_143_2"><sup>2</sup></a> be read by you with practised utterance; he first invented this art, unknown to others.” So grant it, O Phoebus! so grant it, ye blessed souls of poets, and thou, O horned Bacchus, and ye goddesses nine!</p>
<p>Who would doubt that I would have a woman know how to dance,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_143_3" id="target_note_LCL232_143_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that when the wine is set she may, when bidden, move her arms. Artists whom the stage displays win favour as they move their sides; so great a charm has this easy movement. I am ashamed to advise in little things, that she should know the throws of the dice, and thy powers, O flung counter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_143_4a" id="target_note_LCL232_143_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> Now let her throw three dice, and now reflect which side she may fitly join in her cunning, and which challenge. Let her cautiously and not foolishly play the battle of the brigands, when one piece falls before a double

In 358 the reference may be to a piece falling before the attack of two others; cf. <span class="italic">Tristia,</span> 2. 478 (where the whole passage is similar), and Mart. 14. 17; also Pollux, 9, 98, who says that a piece can be taken by two pieces of a different colour. In 359–60 the situation seems to be that of a king in chess trying to avoid checkmate. The available evidence is considered at length in Pauly-Wissowa, s.v. <span class="italic">Lusoria tabula.</span> See also “Roman Board Games,” by R. G. Austin, in <span class="italic">Greece and Rome,</span> Oct. 1934 and Feb. 1935. The point of “aemulus” may lie in the fact that a piece which commonly played with a partner (“compar”) might lose that partner to the enemy; having lost her he perhaps had to go back to where he started.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL232_143_4a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
