praise her the bird of Juno displays her plumes: should you gaze in silence she hides away her wealth. Even steeds, amid the contests of the rapid course, delight to have their manes combed and their necks patted.</p>
<p>Nor be timid in your promises; by promises women are betrayed; call as witnesses what gods you please. Jupiter from on high smiles at the perjuries of lovers, and bids the winds of Aeolus carry them unfulfilled away. Jupiter was wont to swear falsely by Styx to Juno; now he favours his own example. It is expedient there should be gods, and as it is expedient let us deem that gods exist; let incense and wine be poured on the ancient hearths; nor does careless quiet like unto slumber hold them; live innocently, gods are nigh; return what is given to your keeping; let duty keep her covenant; let fraud be absent; keep your hands clean of blood. If you are wise, cheat women only, and avoid trouble; keep faith save for this one deceitfulness. Deceive the deceivers; they are mostly an unrighteous sort; let them fall into the snare which they have laid. Egypt is said to have lacked the rains that bless its fields, and to have been parched for nine years, when Thrasius approached Busiris, and showed that Jove could be propitiated by the outpoured blood of a stranger. To him said Busiris, “Thou shalt be Jove’s first victim, and as a stranger give water unto Egypt.” Phalaris too roasted in his fierce bull the limbs of Perillus; its maker first made trial of his ill-omened work. Both were just; for there is no juster law than that contrivers of death should perish by their own contrivances. Therefore, that perjuries may rightly cheat the perjured, let the woman feel the smart of a wound she first inflicted.</p>
