brings no blush to thee, O Moon, nor is Cephalus
a prize that shames the roseate goddess<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_125_1" id="target_note_LCL232_125_1"><sup>1</sup></a>; though Adonis, whom she mourns, be granted to Venus, whence has she her Aeneas and Harmonia?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_125_2" id="target_note_LCL232_125_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Study, ye mortal folk, the examples of the goddesses, nor deny your joys to hungry lovers. Though they at last deceive you, what do you lose? those joys abide; though they take a thousand pleasures, naught is lost therefrom. Iron is worn away, and flints are diminished by use; that part endures, and has no fear of loss. What forbids to take light from a light that is set before you, or who would guard vast waters upon the cavernous deep? And yet does any woman say to a man, “It is not expedient”?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_125_3" id="target_note_LCL232_125_3"><sup>3</sup></a> tell me, what are you doing, save wasting the water that you will draw? Nor do my words make you vile, but forbid you to fear unreal loss; there is no loss in your giving. But though the blasts of a stronger wind will soon impel me, while I am still in harbour, let a light breeze bear me on.</p>

A great part of you lack a gift so precious. Care will give good looks: looks neglected go to waste though they resemble the Idalian goddess. If women of old did not so cultivate their bodies, the women of old had not lovers so cultivated; if Andromache was clad in a stout tunic, what wonder? she was a hardy soldier’s wife. Were you his spouse, forsooth, would you come dressed up to Ajax, whose protection was seven oxen’s
