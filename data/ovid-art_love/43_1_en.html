driver in his car now lets the reins float loose, now skilfully holds back the galloping steeds. Some women are there whom timid indulgence serves without reward, and, when no rival exists, their passion wanes. Often pride waxes in prosperity, nor is it easy to bear good fortune with equal mind. Just as a fire, growing frail as its forces gradually abate, itself lies hid, while the cinders grow grey on the surface of the fire; but add sulphur, and it finds its extinguished flames, and the light that once was there returns—so when hearts grow torpid in dull repose and freedom from all care, sharp goads must call forth love. See that she has fears about you, and fire anew her cooling thoughts; let her grow pale at hearing of your guilt; O four times and unnumbered times happy is he over whom an injured woman grieves; who, as soon as the charge has reached her unwilling ears, faints away, and voice and colour leave her unhappy frame. May I be he whose hair she furiously rends! may I be he whose tender cheeks her nails attack! whom weeping she regards, at whom she glares with angry eyes, without whom she could not live, though fain she would! Should you ask how long, let the time for her to lament her injuries be short, lest anger gather strength by slow delay; long ere this let your arms encircle her white neck, and gather her weeping to your bosom. Kiss her as she weeps, give her as she weeps the joys of Venus; then there will be peace, in this way alone will anger be dispelled. When she has raged her fill, when she seems your certain foe, then seek the treaty of a love embrace: that will make her gentle. Therein dwells Concord when the fight is o’er; there, believe me, was Reconciliation born.
