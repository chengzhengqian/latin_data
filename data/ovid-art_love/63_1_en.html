<p>You have not come to learn from me, Semele and Leda, or thou, Sidonian maid, borne on the false bull o’er the sea; or Helen, whom not foolishly, Menelaus,
thou askest back, and whom not foolishly, Trojan ravisher, thou dost keep. It is the crowd that come to learn, women both fair and plain; and ever are the plain more numerous than the fair. The beautiful care not for precepts and the help of art; their dowry have they, beauty that without art is powerful; when the sea is calm the careless sailor takes his ease; when it swells high he implores his helpers. Yet rare is the face that lacks a blemish: hide your blemishes, and so far as you can conceal any fault of body. Sit if you are short, lest standing you seem to be sitting, and recline, small as you are, on your couch; here, too, lest your measure be taken as you lie, let your feet be hidden by a robe thrown across them. Let her that is too slender choose garments of full texture, and let her robe hang loosely from her shoulders. Let a pale woman adorn her person with purple stripes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_137_1" id="target_note_LCL232_137_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and one who is swarthy have recourse to the aid of the Pharian fish.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_137_2a" id="target_note_LCL232_137_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> Let an ill-formed foot be ever hidden beneath a snow-white sandal; never release lean ankles from their bonds. Small pads suit high shoulder-blades: a band should surround a narrow chest. Let her whose fingers are fat, or nails rough, mark what she says with but little gesture. She whose breath is tainted should never speak before eating, and she should always stand at a distance from her lover’s face. If you have a tooth that is black or too large or growing out of place, laughing will cost you dear.</p>
