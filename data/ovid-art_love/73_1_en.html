<p>Who forbids me to use great things as examples for little, or to fear the name of leader? To this man a good leader commits a hundred men to be ruled by his vinewood staff,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_157_1" id="target_note_LCL232_157_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to another the care of horsemen, to another that of the standards: do you likewise consider the use to which each of us is suited, and set each in his proper place. Let the rich man give presents; let him who professes law give legal aid; let the eloquent often plead his client’s cause; let us who make poems send poems only: we poets are a band more fitted than the rest for love. ’Tis we who herald the loved one’s beauty far and wide; renowned is Nemesis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_157_2" id="target_note_LCL232_157_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Cynthia is renowned; evening and Eastern lands know of Lycoris, and many inquire who my Corinna may be. Besides, treachery is alien to sacred bards, and our art too helps to shape our character.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_157_3" id="target_note_LCL232_157_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Neither ambition nor love of gain affects us; the Forum we despise, and cultivate the couch and the shade.

Be kind, ye women, to Aonian bards; divinity is in them, and the Muses show them favour. There is a god in us; we are in touch with heaven: from celestial places comes our inspiration. To hope for reward from skilled poets is a crime: ah, wretched that I am, it is a crime no woman fears! Yet dissemble, and carry not greed on your open countenance; a new lover will take fright if he sees the net. But a rider would not use
