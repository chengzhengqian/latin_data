yet believe: Troy would have survived, had she heeded the warnings of Priam’s daughter. Some make their assault under a false appearance of love, and by such approaches seek shameful gains. Let not their hair, sleek with liquid nard, deceive you, nor the tongue of the belt tucked tightly into the creases it makes; let not the toga of finest texture play you false, nor if there be one ring and yet another on their fingers. Perchance out of their number the most elegant will prove a thief, and be inflamed by longing for your robe. “Give me back my own,” robbed women often cry; “give me back my own,” cry their voices over the whole forum: these quarrels dost thou watch unheeding, O Venus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_151_1" id="target_note_LCL232_151_1"><sup>1</sup></a> from temples shining with lavish gold, thou and thy Appian Nymphs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_151_2" id="target_note_LCL232_151_2"><sup>2</sup></a> There are, too, certain villains<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_151_3" id="target_note_LCL232_151_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of ill fame unquestionable; but thousands are guilty of deserting their sweethearts. Learn from the complaints of another to fear this prospect for yourselves; nor let your door be open to a false lover. Ye maids of Athens, believe not Theseus’ oaths: the gods he will call to witness, he has called upon before, and thou too, Demophoon, heir of Theseus’ reproach, art no longer trusted since thou didst play Phyllis false. If they make fair promises, promise in as many words; if they give, give also your bargained joys. That woman could extinguish Vesta’s watchful flame, and rob thy temple, Inachis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_151_4" id="target_note_LCL232_151_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of its sanctities, and give aconite mixed with pounded hemlock to her lover, who receives a gift and then denies her favours.</p>
