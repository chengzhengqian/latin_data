has this fault done me harm: wiser he by whose complaisance other men come to his mistress. But ignorance were better: allow deceptions to be hid, lest the shame of confession fly from her dissembling countenance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_105_1" id="target_note_LCL232_105_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Wherefore all the more, O lovers, detecting your mistresses; let them err, and erring think they have deceived. Detection fans the flame of passion; where two have shared misfortune, each persists in the cause of his own fall. There is a story, most famous over all the world, of Mars and Venus caught by Mulciber’s guile. Father Mars, plagued by frenzied love of Venus, from a terrible captain became a lover. Nor was Venus bashful (for no goddess has a tenderer heart), nor unresponsive to Gradivus’ prayers. Ah, how oft is she said to have laughed, the wanton, at her husband’s legs, and at his hands hardened by fire and workmanship! In Mars’ presence she had but to imitate Vulcan, and it became her: and much charm was mingled with her beauty. But at first they concealed their meetings well, and full of shamefast modesty was their sinning. By the Sun’s evidence (who could deceive the Sun?) the doings of his wife were made known to Vulcan. How bad an example, Sun, you are giving! Request a privilege from her: you too she will oblige, if you will but hold your tongue. Mulciber disposes hidden snares around and above the couch; the device baffles the eye. He feigns a voyage to Lemnos; the lovers meet as arranged; caught in the snares the two lie naked. He summons the gods; the captured pair afford a spectacle; scarce did Venus, they say, restrain her tears. They cannot cover their faces, nor even veil their lewd parts
