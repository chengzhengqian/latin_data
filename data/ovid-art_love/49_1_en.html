Venus herself,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_109_1a" id="target_note_LCL232_109_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> as oft as she lays aside her robes, half stooping covers with her left hand her secret parts. Beasts unite everywhere and in public view: at the sight a maiden naturally turns her face aside. Chambers and a locked door beseem our secret doings, the parts of shame are hid ’neath a covering garment, and we seek, if not darkness, at least dim shadow and somewhat less than open daylight. In those days too when sun and rain were not yet kept out by a roof, but an oak gave food and covering alike, pleasure was shared in forest and cave, not in the open air: so strong was the thought of shame in a simple folk. But now we make our nightly exploits a title to renown, and purchase at a high price naught but the power to brag! What! shall you make trial of all women everywhere, so that you may say to no matter who, “She too was mine,” and never lack girls to point to with your finger? As you touch upon each, shall there be a tale of shame? I lament but trifles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_109_2" id="target_note_LCL232_109_2"><sup>2</sup></a>: some make up tales which if true they would deny, and say there is no woman with whom they have not lain. If bodies escape them, they take hold of names, and though the body escape, the name retains the charge. Go now, hateful guardian, bar the lady’s door, and add a hundred bolts to the sturdy posts. What remains secure, when the dishonourer of her name abides, and would have what ne’er befell believed? As for me I recount even true amours but sparely, and a solid secrecy hides my dark intrigues.</p>
