the same bridle for a horse who but lately felt the reins and for one who knows his paces; nor must the same path be taken to catch discreet age and tender youth. This raw recruit, now first known to Love’s campaigning, who has come, a new prey, to your chamber-door—let him know none but you, let him cling to you alone; high is the fence that must guard that tender crop. Avoid a rival: you will prevail, so long as you alone have power; in partnership neither thrones nor love stand sure.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_159_1" id="target_note_LCL232_159_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the veteran will come gradually and prudently to love, and will bear much a recruit would not endure; he will not break doors nor burn them with fierce flames, nor attack with his nails the soft cheeks of his mistress, nor rend his own nor his lady’s clothes, nor will torn tresses be a cause of weeping. Such doings suit lads aflame with youth and love; but he will bear bitter smarts composedly, he will burn, ah, with slow fires like damp hay, like timber lately cut from the mountain ridge.

What is easily given ill fosters an enduring love; let an occasional repulse vary your merry sport. Let him lie before your gate; let him cry, “Ah, cruel door!” and play the suppliant oft, and oft the threatener. We cannot bear sweetness; let us be refreshed by bitter juices; oft is a vessel sunk by favouring winds; ’tis this which prevents wives from being loved: to them their husbands come
