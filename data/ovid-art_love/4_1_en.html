Syrian Jew holds sacred.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_19_1" id="target_note_LCL232_19_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Avoid not the Memphian shrine of the linen-clothed heifer: many a maid does she make what she was herself to Jove.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_19_2" id="target_note_LCL232_19_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Even the law-courts (who could believe it?) are suitable to love, often has its flame been found in the shrill-tongued
court: where set beneath the marble shrine of Venus, the Appian nymph strikes the air with her upspringing waters,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_19_3" id="target_note_LCL232_19_3"><sup>3</sup></a> there often is the lawyer surprised by Love, and he who was careful for others is not careful for himself: often there does the glib speaker fail for words: a new case comes on and his own cause must be pleaded. Venus laughs at him from her neighbouring shrine: he who was of late an advocate would fain be a client now.</p>
<p>But specially do your hunting in the round theatres: more bountifully do these repay your vows. There will you find an object for passion or for deception, something to taste but once, or to keep, if so you wish. As crowded ants pass and repass in a long train, bearing in grain-burdened mouth their wonted food, or as bees, having gained their dells and fragrant pastures, flit o’er the blossoms and hover o’er the thyme: so hasten the smartest women to the crowded games; many a time have their numbers made my judgment falter. They come to see, they come that they may be seen: to chastity that place is fatal. Thou first, Romulus, didst disturb the games, when the rape of Sabine women consoled the wifeless men.
