not at such a time o’ermuch to the treacherous lamp; darkness and drink impair your judgment of beauty. It was in heaven’s light unveiled that Paris beheld the goddesses, when he said to Venus, “Venus, thou dost surpass the other two.” By night are blemishes hid, and every fault is forgiven: that hour makes any woman fair. Consult the daylight for jewels, for wool dyed in purple, consult it too for the face and bodily form.</p>
<p>Why should I recount to you all the gatherings of women, fit occasions for hunting? the sand would yield to my counting. Why tell of Baiae, a shore fringed with boats, and the water that smokes with hot sulphur? Someone came hence with a wound in his heart, and said: “Those waters were not, as fame reports them, healthy.” Lo! hard by the city is Dian’s woodland shrine,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_31_1a" id="target_note_LCL232_31_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> and the realm won by the sword and guilty hand: because she is a maid and hates the darts of Cupid, she has given and will give to our people many a wound.</p>
<p>So farmy muse, borneupon unequal wheels,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_31_2" id="target_note_LCL232_31_2"><sup>2</sup></a> teaches you where to select an object for your love, and where to spread your nets. Now do I essay a task of preeminent skill, to tell you by what arts to catch her whom you have chosen. Ye men, whoever, wherever ye may be, attend with docile minds; and, common folk, lend favouring presence to my enterprise.</p>
<p>First let assurance come to your minds, that all women can be caught; spread but your nets and you will catch them. Sooner would birds be silent in spring, or grasshoppers in summer, or the hound of Maenalus flee before the hare than a woman
