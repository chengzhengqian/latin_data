Cleave the sea with oars, or the earth with the plough, or exert your warlike hands in savage battle, or bring to women’s service your bodily strength and vigour and diligence: this too is warfare, this too calls for your powers. Add this, that they have greater acquaintance with their business, and they have experience, which alone gives skill, upon their side: they make good the waste of years by elegance, and by their pains contrive not to seem old. According to your taste they will embrace you in a thousand ways; no picture could devise more modes than they. They need no spur to enjoy their pleasure: let both man and woman feel what delights them equally. I hate embraces which leave not each outworn; that is why a boy’s love appeals to me but little. I hate her who gives because she must, and who, herself unmoved, is thinking of her wool. Pleasure given as a duty has no charms for me; for me let no woman be dutiful. I like to hear the words that confess rapture, that beg me hold back and stay awhile. May I see my mistress in frenzy, with eyes that confess defeat; may she be languid, and long refuse to be embraced. These joys, which come quickly after seven lustres, nature has not granted to early youth. Let those who hasten drink new liquor; for me let a jar put down under ancient consuls pour forth its ancestral wine. Neither can the plane tree, save it be mature, resist the sun, and new-sprung meads injure naked feet.
