<p><span class="sc">At</span> Milan also are all things wonderful, abundant wealth, countless stately houses, men able, eloquent, and cheerfully disposed; besides, there is the grandeur of the site enlarged by a double wall,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_273_1" id="target_note_LCL096_273_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the Circus, her people’s joy, the massy enclosed Theatre with wedge-like blocks of seats, the temples, the imperial citadels, the wealthy Mint, and the quarter renowned under the title of the Baths of Herculeus;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_273_2" id="target_note_LCL096_273_2"><sup>2</sup></a> her colonnades all adorned with marble statuary, her walls piled like an earthen rampart round the city’s edge:—all these, as it were rivals in the vast masses of their workmanship, are passing grand; nor does the near neighbourhood of Rome abase them.</p>
