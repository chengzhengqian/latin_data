<p><span class="sc">Third</span> would be Antioch, the home of Phoebus’ laurel,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_271_1" id="target_note_LCL096_271_1"><sup>1</sup></a> if Alexander’s settlement were willing to be placed fourth: both hold the same rank. These also doth frenzied ambition drive into rivalry of vices: each is disordered with her mob, and half-crazed with the riots of her frantic populace. This, fertile and secure, vaunts herself because she has the Nile for bulwark and is deep-embayed in her sheltered site; that, because her rival power confronts the faithless Persians.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span><p>Ye, too, go forward equal and uphold the Macedonian name. Great Alexander founded thee; while she claims that Seleucus whose birthmark was an anchor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_271_2" id="target_note_LCL096_271_2"><sup>2</sup></a> whereof the branded likeness is wont to be the sure token of his race; for through his whole succeeding line this natal sign has run.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Long</span> has Gaul, mighty in arms, yearned to be praised, and that royal<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_271_3" id="target_note_LCL096_271_3"><sup>3</sup></a> city of the Treveri, which, though full near the Rhine, reposes unalarmed as if in the bosom of deep profound peace, because she feeds, because she clothes and arms the forces of the Empire. Widely her walls stretch forward over a spreading hill; beside her bounteous Moselle glides past with peaceful stream, carrying the far-brought merchandise of all races of the earth.</p>

When born, her son was found to have a birth-mark, shaped like an anchor, upon his thigh.
