Stloga made the loan on the surety of another extremely distinguished man, Publius Fulvius Neratus. When Heraclides paid Stloga, he got the funds from two other eminent men, Gaius and Marcus Fufius, who were Roman knights. This is indeed a case of “picking out a crow’s eye” as the saying goes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_495_a" id="target_note_LCL324_495_a"><sup>a</sup></a> He cheated Hermippus here who was a scholar, a fellow-citizen and a man who should have known all about him. It was on his guarantee that Heraclides got the money from the Fufii. Hermippus sets off for Temnus with an easy mind, since the rogue Heraclides said that he would repay the Fufii the money that he had borrowed on the guarantee of Hermippus with funds obtained from his students.

Meanwhile, and not so long afterwards, a freedman came to Hermippus from the Fufii with a letter asking him to repay the money. Hermippus asks Heraclides for it, but pays the Fufii in Rome and so discharges his guarantee. Heraclides gets into a panic and does not know which way to turn, and Hermippus sues him. The case is heard by assessors. Do not think, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">48</span><span class="br"></span> gentlemen, that the impudence of cheats and defaulters is not one and the same the whole world over. He did everything that our debtors usually do. He flatly denied that he had raised any second loan at Rome; that he had ever heard of the name Fufius;
