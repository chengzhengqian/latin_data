in the holocaust of your fatherland, than the sating of his evil hatred of us all with the blood of Lucius Flaccus? Let us appease Lentulus, then, let us atone <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">96</span><span class="br"></span> for Cethegus, let us recall the exiled; let us in our turn, if you wish, pay the penalty for an excess of devotion and a deep affection for our fatherland. We are now being named by informers, accusations are being forged against us, trials are being prepared for us.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_547_a" id="target_note_LCL324_547_a"><sup>a</sup></a> If they were using others for these activities, even if they had roused the mob of ignorant citizens using the name of the people, we could bear it with greater equanimity; but it is intolerable that they should believe that senators and Roman knights, whose single-minded valour united them in all these actions for our common safety, can despoil of all their fortunes and banish from the State the prime movers, leaders and principals in these events. They see that the spirit and will of the Roman people have not changed. The Roman people shows what it feels in every way it can; men are unanimous in what they think, in what they want and in what they say. It is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">97</span><span class="br"></span> for this reason that, if anyone calls me there, I come; far from refusing to have the Roman people as arbitrator, I demand them. Let there be no violence—away with the swords and stones—let the hired gangs withdraw, let the slaves remain silent. No one who hears me, provided that he is a free man and a citizen, will be so unjust as not to think that I deserve reward rather than punishment.</p>
<p>Immortal gods! What could be worse than this? Are we, who tore the sword and the brand from the hands of Publius Lentulus and trusted the judgement of the ignorant crowd, afraid of the votes of the cream of our citizens and our most distinguished men?
