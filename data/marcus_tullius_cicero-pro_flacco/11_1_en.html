those who carry the most weight, but the most shameless and the fastest talkers. You, however, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> weigh up a witness carefully in private suits where the issues involved are trivial, and even if you are familiar with his appearance, his name, his tribe, you still think that you should look into his character. When one of us Romans gives evidence, what self-restraint he shows, what control over his language, what fear that he may display self-interest or illtemper, or that he may say too little or too much! Surely you do not view in the same light those men to whom their oath before you is a joke, their evidence to you a game, your opinion of them a worthless nothing; who see in a shameless lie all their chances of honour, profit, influence and favour? I shall not, however, prolong my speech; it could be endless if I wanted to display the untrustworthiness of the whole nation in giving evidence. I shall, instead, move nearer home and speak about your witnesses in this case.</p>
<p>We have got an energetic prosecutor, gentlemen, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> and an enemy in every way offensive and dangerous. I hope that with all this energy he will be of great service to his friends and to the Republic, but he certainly undertook this case and prosecution inflamed by an unbelievable passion!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_455_a" id="target_note_LCL324_455_a"><sup>a</sup></a> What a staff he had for collecting the evidence! Staff do I say? No, what an army! What extravagance, what expense, what munificence! Although this is helpful to my case, I speak with hesitation because I am afraid that Laelius may think that in my speech some gossip or odium has been worked up against him owing to these activities which he has undertaken in his thirst for glory.</p>
