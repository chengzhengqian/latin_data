the city of Pergamum praised you. Surely the city of Pergamum is not more honourable than Smyrna? Not even its own citizens claim that.</p>
<p>I would like just to have the time to read out the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">75</span><span class="br"></span> decree that the people of Smyrna passed in honour of Castricius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_525_a" id="target_note_LCL324_525_a"><sup>a</sup></a> upon his death: firstly, that his body should be brought into the town—an honour not conferred upon others—secondly, that the young men should carry it, and finally, that a golden crown should be placed upon it. The famous Publius Scipio did not receive these honours when he died at Pergamum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_525_b" id="target_note_LCL324_525_b"><sup>b</sup></a> In heaven’s name, the titles they give to Castricius! They call him “the glory of his fatherland, the pride of the Roman people, the flower of the youth.” So, if you are eager for glory, Decianus, I think that you had better look for other honours; the Pergamenes were making fun of you. Did you not realize that you were being ridiculed <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">76</span><span class="br"></span> when they read out phrases like: “a man of distinction, of exceptional wisdom, of unique ability”? Believe me, they were making fun of you. When they were putting a golden crown at the head of the text, they were really giving you no more gold than they would give a jackdaw. Could you not even then see through their fun and wit? And so those Pergamenes rejected with their own hands the titles you brought to be registered. Publius Orbius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_525_c" id="target_note_LCL324_525_c"><sup>c</sup></a> a man of good sense and integrity, gave every decision against you. With my friend Publius Globulus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_525_d" id="target_note_LCL324_525_d"><sup>d</sup></a> you were more successful—and how we both regret it! You allege <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">77</span><span class="br"></span> that Flaccus’ decision in your case was prejudiced and you add as your reasons for his hostility that your father when tribune of the commons brought to trial his father Lucius Flaccus who was curule aedile.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_525_e" id="target_note_LCL324_525_e"><sup>e</sup></a>
