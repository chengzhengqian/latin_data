craftsmen, shopkeepers and all the dregs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_463_a" id="target_note_LCL324_463_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of a city, particularly against a man who has recently held the supreme power and has not been able to attract deep affection to himself because of the very word “power”? It is indeed surprising that men to whom <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> our axes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_463_b" id="target_note_LCL324_463_b"><sup>b</sup></a> are a hated symbol, our name is gall, our pasture-tax, tithes and customs dues are death, gladly seize any opportunity for harming us that is offered! Remember, then, that when you hear Greek resolutions, you are not hearing evidence; you are hearing the wild decisions of a mob, the voice of every nonentity, the din of ignoramuses, an inflamed meeting of the most unstable of nations. Scrutinize thoroughly the nature and motivation of the charges; you will find nothing there but the hope of one group and terrorization and threats against the other.</p>
<p>Suppose that a city has nothing in the treasury, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> nothing in taxes; then there are two ways of raising money—by raising a loan or by a poll-tax; but no accounts of a creditor are produced and no imposition of a tax is offered in evidence. I invite you, however, to learn from the letter of Gnaeus Pompeius to Hypsaeus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_463_c" id="target_note_LCL324_463_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and his reply to Pompeius how readily they submit false accounts and enter in the books whatever suits them.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="ac"><span class="italic">The Letters of Pompeius and Hypsaeus are read</span></span></span>
<p>Do you feel that with these letters I am providing convincing evidence of the lax practices of Greeks
