coast and rendered the sea safe without capturing a single pirate? Chance, the locality, the wind and opportunity, all play their part in the taking of prisoners; it is easy to take precautions to protect oneself, not only by means of dens in hidden retreats, but also by the dropping and shifting of gales. It remains to inquire whether that fleet put to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span> sea for a voyage under oars or was merely an entry of expenditure. Surely, then, it cannot be denied—the whole of Asia is witness to it—that the fleet was divided into two squadrons and one cruised above Ephesus and the other below. In this fleet the great Marcus Crassus sailed from Aenus to Asia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_477_a" id="target_note_LCL324_477_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; in these ships Flaccus sailed from Asia to Macedonia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_477_ba" id="target_note_LCL324_477_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> What shortcomings, then, were there in the praetor’s actions? In the number of the ships and the equable division of the expense? He requisitioned half the number that Pompeius had used; how could he possibly be more economical? He divided the cost according to the allocation made by Pompeius which followed Lucius Sulla’s assessment. Sulla had allotted the amount proportionally among all the cities of Asia and both Pompeius and Flaccus followed his method of levying the cost. And the full sum has still not been reached. “He makes no entry in the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span> books.” True; but what would he gain by that omission? The moment he admits responsibility for levying the money, he confesses to what you are making grounds for an accusation. How, therefore, can you prove that by failing to account for this
