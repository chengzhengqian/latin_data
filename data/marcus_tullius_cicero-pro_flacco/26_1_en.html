of wax. If I thought, gentlemen, that you were being <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span> influenced by the resolutions of Acmona and by the letters of the rest of the Phrygians I would at this point cry aloud and speak with all the passion I could muster. I would summon the tax-collectors as witnesses, I would stir up the businessmen, I would appeal too to your own experience. From the discovery that wax had been used I would be confident that the audacious forgery of all the evidence had been clearly detected and suppressed for good. As it is, however, I shall not revile him too harshly, I shall not fly into too great a passion at this fraud, I shall not round on this prattler as if he were a witness of some account, nor shall I spend time on the evidence from Acmona, whether it has been forged here, as appears to be the case, or whether it has been sent from home as is their story. I shall not fear the evidence of these men to whom I shall return that testimonial, for they are, as Asclepiades says, untrustworthy.</p>

But I suspect that there was a different reason, not to make them appear rather too na√Øve. The penalty for falsifying records by tampering with them is heavier, I think, at Dorylaeum than elsewhere. If they had produced the genuine records, there was nothing with which to accuse Flaccus; if the forged, there was the penalty awaiting them. They thought it a very smart idea to say that they had been lost. So let them keep quiet and allow <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">40</span><span class="br"></span>
