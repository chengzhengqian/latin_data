<p>If, again, as was stated in this same resolution, the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span> most distinguished men in the city who had filled its highest offices had been unjustly condemned by this praetor, why are they neither here in court nor named in the resolution?
