people’s conversation, and so you steered Decianus right into the surrounding crowd. It is not likely that Decianus was bribed by Flaccus and, let me tell you, the other allegations are false—for example, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">83</span><span class="br"></span> Lucceius’ statement that Lucius Flaccus wanted to give him 2,000,000 sesterces as the price of suborning him. Do you accuse of rapacity a man who, according to you, wanted to waste 2,000,000 sesterces? What was he buying when he was buying you? Your defection to his side? What part of the case would we give you? Or was it your disclosure of Laelius’ plans? Or of the witnesses he was putting on the stand? Did we not see for ourselves? That they were living with him? Is it not public knowledge? That the records were in Laelius’ hands? That is not in doubt, is it? That you would press the charge less vigorously and less fully? Now you are raising a suspicion; for the way in which you have spoken suggests that he did get something from you.</p>
<p>You claim that a serious and intolerable injustice <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">84</span><span class="br"></span> has been done to Sextilius Andro<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_533_a" id="target_note_LCL324_533_a"><sup>a</sup></a> because, when his wife Valeria had died intestate, Flaccus dealt with the case as if her estate belonged to him. I want to know what you find wrong in that. Is it that his claim was false? How do you prove it? “She was free-born,” he says. What an expert lawyer he is! Are not estates inherited legally from free-born women? “She had come under the charge of her husband.” Ah! Now I begin to understand<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_533_ba" id="target_note_LCL324_533_ba"><sup>b</sup></a>;
