Flaccus, it is only to secure the purchase. He is buying something, then, which would certainly be worth much more; he pays out of income and does not draw upon his capital. His income, therefore, is smaller; but why does he order the sale of his Alban estate?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_543_aa" id="target_note_LCL324_543_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> Why, moreover, does he cajole his mother, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">92</span><span class="br"></span> why does he prey in his letters upon the weakness of his sister and mother, and finally, why do we not hear him in person? He is presumably detained in the province. His mother denies it. “He would have come,” she says, “if a summons had been sent.” You certainly would have compelled him to attend, if you had placed any reliance upon his evidence; but you did not want to take the man away from his business. He had a hard fight and keen contest with the Greeks ahead of him, but I understand that they lie vanquished. Unaided, he defeated the whole of Asia in a drinking contest. But who told you about these letters, Laelius? The women say that they do not know who it is. Did he tell you himself that he had written to his mother and sister?

These men surely could not fail to have heard about the payment of such a large sum of money. Did you then think, Decianus, that you would substantiate as serious a charge as this by reading out these letters, by producing these poor women, or by your eulogy of the absent writer? It is highly unlikely; for in failing to

It may have been that Falcidius purchased the contract for 900,000 sesterces (37 1/2 talents), but Flaccus annulled the contract and made Falcidius buy it again at a higher price. Cicero alleges that the 50 talents was to ratify a purchase which was worth much more and that Falcidius could therefore pay the sum out of income without the need to sell his Alban estate.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL324_543_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
