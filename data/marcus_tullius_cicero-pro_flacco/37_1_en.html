here in our public meetings! What do you think happens at Tralles? Is it not what happened at Pergamum?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_507_a" id="target_note_LCL324_507_a"><sup>a</sup></a> These cities may perhaps wish it to be thought that they could be instigated more easily by a single letter of Mithridates<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_507_b" id="target_note_LCL324_507_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to violate the friendship of the Roman people, their own loyalty, all the laws of obligation and humanity, than to injure by their evidence a son whose father they had voted to drive from their walls by force of arms. Do not, then, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">58</span><span class="br"></span> thrust at me those names of noble cities; this family will never fear as witnesses the men whom it despised as enemies. And you must admit, if your cities are ruled by the councils of their leading men, that those cities declared war upon the Roman people not as a result of the impetuosity of the mob, but upon the decision of their best men. If, on the other hand, that rising was provoked by the rashness of ignorance, then allow me to distinguish between the crimes of the mob and the position of the city. But Flaccus <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">59</span><span class="br"></span> had no right to take that money. Do you maintain that Flaccus’ father had a right or not? If he had a right, as was certainly the case, to use money collected for the celebrations in his honour from which he got no personal benefit,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_507_c" id="target_note_LCL324_507_c"><sup>c</sup></a> then the son was justified in taking his father’s money. If, however, he did not have the right, after the father’s death not only the son but any heir could take it quite legitimately. And even when the people of Tralles had put that money out on loan for many years at an exorbitant rate of interest, they still obtained everything they wanted from Flaccus and did not have the impertinence to assert, as did Laelius, that Mithridates had taken this money from them. Who did not know that Mithridates was more concerned to enrich the citizens
