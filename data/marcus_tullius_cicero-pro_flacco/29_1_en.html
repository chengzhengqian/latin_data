his property and his title of senator. These three men wanted the records of our treasury too to be falsified because they made a return that they had nine slaves when they had come without a single attendant.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_491_a" id="target_note_LCL324_491_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I see that the first to witness the record of the decree was Lysania, whose brother’s property was sold at public auction when Flaccus was praetor because he was in debt to the government. There is also Philippus, the son-in-law of Lysania, and Hermobius, whose brother Pollis has also been convicted for embezzlement. They say that they gave Flaccus and those with him 15,000 drachmae. I am dealing <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">44</span><span class="br"></span> with a very sharp city, one very careful in keeping its accounts, and one in which not a penny can be moved without the approval of five praetors, three quaestors and four bankers who are there elected by the people. Of all this number not one has been produced in court; and although they enter this sum as credited to Flaccus’ personal account, they say that when they gave him another larger sum, they entered it to temple repairs. This is quite inconsistent; either all the payments ought to have been made secretly or all openly. When they enter a sum to Flaccus by name, they have no alarm or fear, but when they enter it to public works, the selfsame men suddenly become terrified of the man whom they had hitherto regarded with indifference. If the praetor authorized the sum as the record shows, he passed it for payment to the quaestor, the quaestor paid it from the local bank, and the bank got it from local taxation or a poll-tax. There will never be a semblance of a charge here unless you explain to me the principle behind the transactions with full details of the parties and accounts involved.</p>
