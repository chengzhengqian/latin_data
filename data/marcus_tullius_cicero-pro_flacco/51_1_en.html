but I ask whether the marriage was by cohabitation or by sale? If it was a common-law marriage, that was not possible because no alteration in the status of a legal ward can be made without the consent of all the guardians. If it was a marriage by sale? Then it was with the approval of all the guardians; but surely you are not going to say that Flaccus was one of them. There only remains what he has kept on <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">85</span><span class="br"></span> shouting from the roof-tops, that Flaccus should not when he was praetor have conducted business to which he was an interested party nor laid claim to the inheritance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_535_aa" id="target_note_LCL324_535_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> I hear that you, Lucius Lucullus, who are going to be a character-witness for Lucius Flaccus, came into very large legacies in return for your outstanding liberality and the great benefits conferred upon your friends when you were governor of Asia with the rank of proconsul.

He then asks T. Vettius whether, if an estate came to him in Africa, he would lose it to another <span class="italic">usu</span> or keep it without forfeiting his good name. This interpretation of the passage means that <span class="italic">usucapio hereditatis</span> was still in existence, but Cicero’s failure to use it as an argument on his client’s behalf suggests that it was regarded by this time as morally unjustified.
