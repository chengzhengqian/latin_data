they not dealt with before Orbius and referred to Globulus? Did not the representatives of Apollonis when I was consul refer to our Senate all the claims arising out of the injuries done by this one Decianus? But you say you made returns of these estates in the census. I omit the fact that they belonged to others, that they had been taken by violence, that they were declared by the people of Apollonis not to belong to you, that the Pergamenes refused to register them, even that they were reinstated by our magistrates, that you held them without right either of ownership or of possession.

Cicero asks four questions to establish whether this land was capable of being returned in the census: Does the <span class="italic">ius civile</span> apply to it?
