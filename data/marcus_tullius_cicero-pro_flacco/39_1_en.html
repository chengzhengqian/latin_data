<p>There are present men from Athens<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_511_a" id="target_note_LCL324_511_a"><sup>a</sup></a> where men <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">62</span><span class="br"></span> think civilization, learning, religion, agriculture,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_511_b" id="target_note_LCL324_511_b"><sup>b</sup></a> justice and laws were born and spread thence into every land.
