<p>I shall, therefore, omit all this part. I shall only ask of you, gentlemen, that, if you have heard with your own ears from any widespread rumour or gossip of force, violence, arms or troops, you will remember it. Owing to the scandal caused by those activities the number of assistants for collecting evidence was recently fixed by this new law.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_457_aa" id="target_note_LCL324_457_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> Apart from this use <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> of violence, however, look at all the devices which we cannot condemn since they are in accordance with the rights and practices of prosecutors, but which we are nevertheless forced to deplore! Firstly, that the rumour was spread throughout the whole of Asia that Gnaeus Pompeius, being a bitter enemy of Lucius Flaccus, had pressed Laelius, a friend and close acquaintance of his father,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_457_b" id="target_note_LCL324_457_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to summon Flaccus before this court and had used all his authority, influence, resources and power to achieve this end.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_457_c" id="target_note_LCL324_457_c"><sup>c</sup></a> This seemed to Greeks the more likely because not long previously they had seen Laelius on friendly terms with Flaccus in that very province. Also, while Pompeiusâ€™ authority is as universally recognized as it ought to be, it is particularly influential in that province which he has recently freed from war with the pirates and the kings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_457_d" id="target_note_LCL324_457_d"><sup>d</sup></a> He also used the device of frightening those who did not wish to leave home by issuing a witness-summons and those who were bankrupt he got moving with a liberal and generous travel allowance.

The restriction mentioned is appropriate only to a <span class="italic">lex repetundarum</span> which, according to Valerius Maximus 8. 1. 10, also fixed the number of witnesses to be summoned. We know that this trial was held under the <span class="italic">lex Cornelia</span> (Cicero, <span class="italic">pro Rabirio Postumo</span> 9) and we must therefore conclude that the law had been promulgated by the time of this speech.
