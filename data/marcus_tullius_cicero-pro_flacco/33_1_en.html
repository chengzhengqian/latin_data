who never gave in to his effrontery, follows him. Heraclides asks that eminent senator, Gaius Plotius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_499_a" id="target_note_LCL324_499_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who had been a deputy of the governor in Asia, for certain slaves which he said he had been illegally forced to sell when he had been condemned for debt. The distinguished ex-praetor, Quintus Naso,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_499_b" id="target_note_LCL324_499_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is accepted as arbitrator. When, however, he indicated that he was going to give his decision in favour of Plotius, Heraclides rejected him as arbitrator and, because the action was not based on statute law, abandoned the whole case. Do you think, gentlemen, that I am tackling the individual witnesses adequately instead of doing battle only with the class as a whole, as was my original plan?</p>
<p>I come to Lysania from the same city, your own <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">51</span><span class="br"></span> special witness, Decianus. You knew him as a youth at Temnus and because he delighted you then when stripped, you wanted to keep him stripped. You took him from Temnus to Apollonis.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_499_c" id="target_note_LCL324_499_c"><sup>c</sup></a> You lent the lad money at a high rate of interest, but only after taking a security. You say that this security is forfeited to you; you hold it today and it belongs to you. You have forced him to come here to give evidence as a witness in the hope of recovering his family estate. He has not yet given his evidence, so I am waiting to see what he is going to say. I know the sort of man he is; I know their ways and their disregard for the law. So even though I know what he is all ready to say, I shall not contradict him until he has spoken. Otherwise he will alter it all and make up something else. Let him, therefore, keep what he has got ready and I shall keep myself fresh for what he produces.</p>
