<p>A very crafty fellow and well-practised in deceit.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_445_a" id="target_note_LCL324_445_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>What is there in your evidence except caprice, effrontery and sheer folly, seeing that the victory of a very gallant and distinguished man itself provides additional evidence?</p>
<p>And no mean valour in arms, gentlemen.</p>
<p>I am defending a gallant and illustrious man, greathearted, tireless and of outstanding common sense.</p>
<p>Engaged in many wars of various kinds from the time of his youth, a particularly fine leader and a man, to tell the truth, fitted in mind and body by his interests and experience for times of war and a life under arms.</p>
<p>Our ancestors thought, gentlemen, that this class of men should be treated with such concern that they defended them not only when they were victims of malice but even when they were in the wrong. Thus, they used not only to reward meritorious acts but also to pardon their misdeeds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_445_b" id="target_note_LCL324_445_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>Rise, please, noble men and gallant representatives of a magnificent and most honourable city, resist in heaven’s name the lies and insults of those whose weapons you have many times withstood.</p>
<p>A man endowed with all the rewards of personal merit and high repute, a man, in my view, preserved in the State by divine providence as an example of old-time dignity and a memorial to a bygone age.</p>
