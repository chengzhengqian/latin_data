produce Falcidius you have given your judgement that a forged letter will carry more weight than the hypocritical words and feigned grief of Falcidius in person.</p>
<p>Why do I spend so long discussing Falcidius’ <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">94</span><span class="br"></span> letters, Sextilius Andro or Decianus’ census-return, when about the safety of all of us, the fortunes of the citizen-body, the supreme welfare of the State I am silent? In this trial, gentlemen, you are carrying it in its entirety upon your own, your very own shoulders. You see in what times of revolution, in what upheaval and turmoil we are living. Certain men have a host of schemes afoot but their especial aim is that your opinions too, your verdicts and your votes should prove bitterly hostile to all the best citizens. You have brought in many adverse verdicts upon the crime of the conspirators and the Republic deserved to have them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_545_a" id="target_note_LCL324_545_a"><sup>a</sup></a> They do not think that the Republic has been effectively subverted until they have dispossessed the citizens who have served her best with the same punishment as that of those traitors. Gaius Antonius has fallen victim.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_545_b" id="target_note_LCL324_545_b"><sup>b</sup></a> No <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">95</span><span class="br"></span> matter; he did have a certain ill-repute of his own; even so he would not have been convicted, had you been his jurors—I say it and I have a right to say it. On the day of his condemnation the tomb of Lucius Catilina was decorated with flowers and was the scene of a meeting and banquet of reckless desperados and traitors to their country. Funeral rites were performed for Catiline; an attempt is now being made to use you for visiting Lentulus’ punishment upon Flaccus. What sacrifice can you offer more welcome to Publius Lentulus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_545_c" id="target_note_LCL324_545_c"><sup>c</sup></a> who tried to slay you in the embraces of your wives and children and to bury you
