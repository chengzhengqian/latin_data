Our ancestors discharged Manius Aquilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_549_a" id="target_note_LCL324_549_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who had <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">98</span><span class="br"></span> been proved guilty by a succession of witnesses on numerous charges of extortion because he had prosecuted with such energy the war against runaway slaves. Recently, when I was consul, I defended Gaius Piso<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_549_b" id="target_note_LCL324_549_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and because he had been a stout and steadfast consul he was kept safe for the Republic. In the same year I also defended Lucius Murena, the consul-designate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_549_c" id="target_note_LCL324_549_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Even though his prosecutors were men of distinction, not one member of that jury thought that he should listen to a charge of electoral corruption; for Catiline was already in the field and I ensured that they all realized that two consuls were required on the 1st of January.

In reaching their decisions responsible and intelligent jurors have always considered what the interests of the citizens, the common safety and the circumstances of the body-politic required. When the ballot is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">99</span><span class="br"></span> given to you, gentlemen, it will not only be a ballot to vote upon Flaccus, but also one to vote upon the leaders and authors of the national safety, upon all loyal citizens, upon your very selves, upon your children, upon your lives, upon your fatherland and upon the safety of us all. You are not giving your verdict in this case upon the fate of foreign nations, nor upon that of allies; you are giving it upon yourselves and your own country. If, however, the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">100</span><span class="br"></span> provinces’ judgement sways you more than your own, far from objecting, I demand that you be swayed by

He was tried for extortion and although his guilt was acknowledged he was acquitted because of his bravery in the Sicilian Slave War of 101. This was exploited in dramatic fashion by his counsel, Marcus Antonius, who displayed to the court the scars that the defendant had received in battle.
