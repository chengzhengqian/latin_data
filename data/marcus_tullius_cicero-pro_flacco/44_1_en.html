make the people of Apollonis, so strongly attached to the Roman people and such faithful allies, more miserable than ever did Mithridates or even your own father? Why do you not allow them to enjoy their freedom or even to be free at all? They are the most thrifty and honest men in the whole of Asia, completely untouched by the extravagance and unreliability of Greeks, yeomen content with their lot, farmers and countrymen. Their land is naturally fertile and made more so by their careful toil and cultivation. This was the district in which you wanted an estate. Doubtless I would prefer it, and it was more like you, if you now wanted fertile land, that you should have acquired an estate somewhere in this area at Crustumium or at Capena.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_521_a" id="target_note_LCL324_521_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I do not press <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">72</span><span class="br"></span> my point; there is a saying of Cato, “Distance lends cheapness.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_521_b" id="target_note_LCL324_521_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It certainly is a long way from the Tiber to the Caicus, a place where even Agamemnon would have lost his way with his army, had he not found Telephus to direct him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_521_c" id="target_note_LCL324_521_c"><sup>c</sup></a> I let that pass too; you liked the town and found the district delightful. You should have bought your estate. Amyntas is the leading man of that city in birth, position, reputation and wealth. Decianus got a hold over his mother-in-law, a woman of limited intelligence, though wealthy enough, and without her realizing what was happening he installed his slaves in possession of her estate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_521_da" id="target_note_LCL324_521_da"><sup>d</sup></a> He abducted Amyntas’ wife who was pregnant and gave birth to a daughter in Decianus’ house where both the wife and daughter of Amyntas still remain today. I am not making up any of this story, am I, Decianus? <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">73</span><span class="br"></span> All the aristocracy knows it, men of substance
