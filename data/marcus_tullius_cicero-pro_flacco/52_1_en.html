by his term of office, no authority of his position prompted Flaccus to commit any act of injustice. And my friend, the excellent Marcus Lurco, has <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">86</span><span class="br"></span> aimed the sting of his evidence at the same target. He has said that a praetor ought not to seek money from a private citizen in his province. Tell me, Lurco; why not? He ought not extract it by force or accept it illegally; but you will never show that it is wrong for him to make a claim, unless you prove that it is made illegally. Is it right to accept missions at the public expense<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_537_a" id="target_note_LCL324_537_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for the purpose of recovering a private debt? Men of integrity, including yourself a short time ago, have often done so. I do not object to this practice although I see that the allies complain of it, but do you think that a praetor who does not renounce an inheritance in his province is not only morally culpable but also guilty of a criminal offence? “Valeria,” he says, “had settled all her money upon him for a dowry.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL324_537_b" id="target_note_LCL324_537_b"><sup>b</sup></a> None of those arguments can be developed unless you show that she was not a ward of Flaccus. If she was, any dowry settled without his consent is void. Nevertheless, you saw that, although Lurco with his <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">87</span><span class="br"></span> usual dignity kept his language within bounds when giving evidence, he was angry with Flaccus. He did not hide the cause of his anger nor did he think that he ought to keep it secret. He complained that his freedman had been condemned while Flaccus was praetor. What a wretched state the government of our provinces is in! Devotion to duty breeds animosity and negligence censure, firm action is dangerous and to be easy-going wins no thanks; their conversation is full of traps, their flattery dangerous
