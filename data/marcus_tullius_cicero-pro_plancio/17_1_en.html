among its hills hearts loyal and unaffected and staunchly true to the bond of kinship, counted my client’s distinction an honour, his promotion a compliment, to itself. Roman knights have come from these same townships and are here to-day to present their official testimony, and the suspense they feel for Plancius now is only equalled by their zeal for him then; for indeed deprivation of property<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_435_a" id="target_note_LCL158_435_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is a more bitter fate than failure to win <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> promotion to public office.
