merely your tears, but your powers, mental, bodily, and material, at my service, when you had protected my wife and children in my absence with your succour and your substance, in all your dealings with me you gave me to believe that you readily granted me full permission to devote all my efforts to promoting Plancius’ advancement, because, as you alleged, you yourself viewed with gratitude his <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">74</span><span class="br"></span> services to me. And as a proof that I do but say what I have always said, and have not changed my tune to suit the time, have you not the speech<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_505_a" id="target_note_LCL158_505_a"><sup>a</sup></a> which I delivered before the senate immediately upon my return? In that speech I alluded gratefully, though only cursorily, to a small selection of my benefactors, for it would have been impossible to mention every one, though it would have been criminal to make any omissions, and I had determined to name those only who had been leaders and standard-bearers in my cause. Among those whom I thanked on that occasion was Plancius. Let this speech be read to the court, for, in view of the importance of the occasion, it was delivered from manuscript. In it I, like the artful fellow you would have me to be, declared my devotion to one to whom I was in no particular debt, and so cemented by an undying testimony the fetters of obligation which his signal service had laid upon me. I forbear to read to you my other literary compositions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_505_b" id="target_note_LCL158_505_b"><sup>b</sup></a> bearing upon my subject; I waive them, lest, in bringing them to your notice, I should lay myself open to the charge of opportunism, or of reliance upon a type of literature, which may seem to accord better with my own pursuits than with the conventional usage of these courts.</p>
