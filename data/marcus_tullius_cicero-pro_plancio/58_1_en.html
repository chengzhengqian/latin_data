at all? You also asserted that my motive in attaching the penalty of exile to the offence of bribery in the terms of my law<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_517_a" id="target_note_LCL158_517_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was that in my perorations I might be able to make more harrowing appeals to pity. You would imagine, gentlemen, would you not, that his opponent was a professional ranter, instead of one who had undergone a laborious <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">84</span><span class="br"></span> apprenticeship to the bar? “For I,” he says, “never went to Rhodes,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_517_b" id="target_note_LCL158_517_b"><sup>b</sup></a> implying that I did. “But,” he adds, “I have been”—I thought he was going to say “among the Vaccaei<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_517_c" id="target_note_LCL158_517_c"><sup>c</sup></a>”—“twice in Bithynia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_517_d" id="target_note_LCL158_517_d"><sup>d</sup></a>” If localities give any handle for censure, I cannot understand why you should think that Nicaea is a place of stricter morals than Rhodes; if we are to consider our respective motives, the business that took me to Rhodes was just as highly respectable as the business that took you to Bithynia.

It is the punctiliousness of men like you that is to blame; you scrupulously weigh the merits of all the briefs submitted to you and reject nearly all, and the result is that most of them are crowded upon me, who have not the heart to say “no” to the unhappy <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">85</span><span class="br"></span> victims of embarrassment.
