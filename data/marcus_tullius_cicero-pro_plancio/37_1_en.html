have often occurred under circumstances which have led the defeated parties to believe that they received a boon from the people.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_475_a" id="target_note_LCL158_475_a"><sup>a</sup></a> That eloquent noble, Lucius Philippus, was never elected tribune of the plebs, that renowned and gallant young man Gaius Caelius was never elected quaestor, Publius Rutilius Rufus, Gaius Fimbria, Gaius Cassius, Gnaeus Orestes were never elected tribunes of the plebs, and yet, in spite of everything, all these, as we know, became consuls.

In view of this, and in view of the wide divergence of popular feeling, you must not think that none were scandalized by your uncompromising attitude; it was these, possibly, who took you off your guard, and so were able to oust you; but, if you are forewarned and forearmed, you will assuredly never again be so ousted.</p>
