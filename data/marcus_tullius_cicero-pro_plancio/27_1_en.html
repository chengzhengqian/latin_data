The only point in which you have followed the law of Licinius is the form of the nomination of the jury which it enjoins; if this system of empanelling is fair in any respect save in this nomination of tribes, I am at a loss to account for the fact that only in cases of this nature has the senate ruled that the tribes should be nominated by the prosecutor, and has never extended this nomination to all kinds of cases; but in cases dealing expressly with corrupt practices it has allowed prosecutor and defendant to challenge the jury alternately, and, though it has imposed every other oppressive feature, it has not thought fit to impose that of a nominated jury. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">37</span><span class="br"></span> But is the motive of this enactment really so hard to seek?

An oppressive system, gentlemen, in all conscience; but one to which a defendant could hardly object, if the tribe named to try him were either his own, or one which circumstances had closely connected with him.</p>
