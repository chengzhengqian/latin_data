I grant you that it would have been a grand thing for traitors to be conquered by patriots, if only I could have made an end of conquest there; but of this I saw no prospect. For where could I have found at hand to help me consuls as brave as Lucius Opimius, Gaius Marius, or Lucius Flaccus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_523_a" id="target_note_LCL158_523_a"><sup>a</sup></a> under whose armed leadership the republic quelled her traitorous citizens, or, if brave men were lacking, consuls so upright as Publius Mucius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_523_b" id="target_note_LCL158_523_b"><sup>b</sup></a> who proved that Publius Scipio, though a private citizen, was amply justified in his resort to arms by his destruction of Tiberius Gracchus?
