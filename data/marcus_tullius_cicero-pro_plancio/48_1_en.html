patriots have me in their debt; but those very patriots and honest citizens, whose debtor I am, affirmed that on my account they owed to Plancius a debt which the election of the aediles enabled them to discharge. Let us grant, then, that I am in debt to many, and to Plancius among them; ought I then to declare myself to be a bankrupt? Ought I not rather to discharge to all the rest their several debts as each falls due, and settle the account that presses at once, when it is demanded? And yet a pecuniary obligation is a very different thing from a moral obligation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_497_a" id="target_note_LCL158_497_a"><sup>a</sup></a> He who discharges a debt in money, ceases forthwith to possess that which he has paid; while he who remains a debtor keeps what does not belong to him. But in a moral debt, when I pay I keep, and when I keep, I pay by the very act of keeping. If I discharge this debt to Plancius, I shall not thereby cease to be his debtor, and I should be repaying my debt to him none the less by my good wishes, if the present unfortunate <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">69</span><span class="br"></span> situation had not occurred. You ask me, Cassius, what I could do for my brother, whom I love deeply, or for my children, the sweetest things that life holds for me, more than I am doing for Plancius, and you show by your question that you fail to realize that it is the affection I feel for them which more than anything else stirs and impels me to champion my client in his hour of peril. For not only do they hold his safety dear above all things, since they know that by him my own was guarded, but I myself can never look upon them without recalling the obligation I am under to him, remembering, as I do, that it was his efforts that preserved me for them.</p>
