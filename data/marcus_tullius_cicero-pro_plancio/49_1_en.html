<p>You remind us that even that saviour of the state, Opimius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_499_a" id="target_note_LCL158_499_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was condemned; you mention Calidius, too, on whose motion it was that Quintus Metellus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_499_b" id="target_note_LCL158_499_b"><sup>b</sup></a> was restored to civil rights; and you blame my intercession on behalf of Plancius, pointing out that his own credit did not secure acquittal for Opimius, nor that of Metellus for Calidius.</p>

As regards Opimius, would that his sad story could be erased from the memory of men! His fall must be looked upon as a death-blow to the state, a disgrace to our empire, a stain upon the name of the Roman people, rather than the verdict of a court of law. For what deadlier blow could those jurymen, if jurymen they are to be called, and not rather unnatural children of their fatherland, have inflicted upon the state, than to eject from his citizen rights the man who had liberated the state, as praetor, from war with a neighbouring people and, as consul, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">71</span><span class="br"></span> from civil war?
