For in popular politics, he who is actuated either by prejudice or by partisanship will always be but a partial judge of merit; not that I would admit, Laterensis, that you can lay claim to a monopoly of any distinction which Plancius does not share with you.</p>

For if this were so, our juries would virtually possess a power which in the days of our ancestors the patricians were unable to retain, the power of passing their censure upon the elections; or they would possess a power even more intolerable, for in the old days the man who had been elected to an office did not enter upon it if the patricians withheld their assent; whereas what is demanded of you to-day is that, by your condemnation of the people’s choice, you should pass a stricture upon the people’s wisdom.
