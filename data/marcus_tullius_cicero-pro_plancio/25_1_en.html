because the auctions had been postponed? “No,” was the reply, “it is because the hearing of the embassies has been postponed.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_451_a" id="target_note_LCL158_451_a"><sup>a</sup></a> On another occasion Granius met Marcus Drusus, the tribune of the plebs, an influential man, but absorbed in political intrigue. Drusus saluted him, and made the formal inquiry, “How are you getting on, Granius?” “No,” replied Granius; “it is I who should ask <span class="italic">you</span> how <span class="italic">you</span> are getting on.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL158_451_b" id="target_note_LCL158_451_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It was Granius too who often employed the licence granted to his brusque wit in sarcastic comments upon the political designs of Lucius Crassus or Marcus Antonius. But now this state of ours is so crushed beneath the weight of a pompous self-sufficiency that to-day a Roman knight has less freedom to raise his voice in protest than an auctioneer had once to raise it in ridicule. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span> To what expressions did the elder Plancius ever commit himself which did not breathe a spirit of indignation rather than of insult? And when did he ever raise his voice in protest, save to protect himself and his partners from wrong? When the senate was prevented from replying to a petition of the Roman knights, a privilege which had never been refused even to our enemies, the injustice was resented by all the tax-farmers, but Plancius made rather less efforts to conceal this resentment than did the others. They, no doubt, stifled within their breasts the expression of their corporate emotion; while Plancius, more than the rest, bore upon his countenance and upon his tongue, for all to see and hear, those feelings which the rest shared with him. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span> Not, gentlemen,—and here I speak from my own experience,—not but what several remarks are attributed to Plancius which never passed his lips.
