no manuscript authority. After Antony’s defeat at Mutina in April
43, which the writer credits to Octavian, ignoring the Consuls to
whom the credit really belonged, Antony took what was left of his
army across the Alps, joined up with Caesarian armies in Gaul,
and returned to Italy to make an accord with Octavian, forming
with him and Lepidus the Triumvirate for the Constitution of
the Republic. Then as the writer would have it, his army, which
Octavian had defeated, saluted Octavian as Imperator. It remained
of course under Antony’s command.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL462_349_13').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL462_349_14a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL462_349_14a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">14</sup>Octavian was given license to hold the Consulship ten years before the minimum legal age of 43, a mere gesture, since he was

on Rome (19 August 43) to demand and get the Consulship along
with his kinsman Pedius. But that was some three months prior to
the putative date of the Letter. Are the present tenses ‘historic’
or is the writer’s imprecise chronology at fault? See however
Lamacchia (2), 16.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL462_349_17').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
