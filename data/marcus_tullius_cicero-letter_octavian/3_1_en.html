Antonius, a man of highest spirit (would that he had been
of wise counsel as well!), conceived an ambition<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_347_7" id="target_note_LCL462_347_7"><sup>7</sup></a> for primacy
of more monarchical a character than a free community
could tolerate. He proceeded to dissipate public
funds, empty the treasury, reduce revenues, grant tax exemptions
to communities and citizenship to peoples—out
of a notebook.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_347_8" id="target_note_LCL462_347_8"><sup>8</sup></a> He exercised Dictatorship, imposed laws,
forbade the appointment of a Dictator,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_347_9" id="target_note_LCL462_347_9"><sup>9</sup></a> personally resisted
laws and senatorial decrees in the Senate, wanted all
provinces for himself alone,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_347_10" id="target_note_LCL462_347_10"><sup>10</sup></a> while scorning the province
of Macedonia, which victorious Caesar had chosen for
himself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_347_11" id="target_note_LCL462_347_11"><sup>11</sup></a> What were we to hope for or expect from him?</p>
<p>You stood forth as champion of our freedom, in the best
of dispositions as it seemed at the time—would that we
had not been deceived in our opinion and your good faith!
You brought the veterans together and diverted two legions
from the destruction of the Fatherland to its rescue,
thus suddenly raising up the well-nigh beaten down and
prostrate commonwealth by your own resources. What did
the Senate not bestow upon you—before you asked, more
than you would have wished, more than you would have
hoped? It gave you the rods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_347_12" id="target_note_LCL462_347_12"><sup>12</sup></a> in order to have a champion
with authority, not to arm you with power against itself. It
gave you the title of <span class="italic">imperator</span> when the enemy army had
been vanquished, paying you honour, not for that fleeing
