When we were under the yoke of slavery, with the evil gaining day by day and none to defend us, dreading the return of Marcus Antonius from Brundisium and the death and ruin it would bring, Caesar took a decision which none of us hoped for and certainly none of us knew of in advance: to raise from his father’s soldiers an army which had never known defeat and turn Antonius’ fury and the cruel designs which inspired it, away from the destruction of the Republic.</p>

<section class="div2">
<p>[2] For who does not realize that if <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>Caesar had not raised an army, Antonius’ return would have entailed our destruction? He was coming back in a fever of hatred against you, stained with the blood of the Roman citizens he had killed in Suessa and Brundisium, his only thought being the ruin of the Roman people. What was there to defend your lives and liberty, if it had not been for Gaius Caesar’s army composed of his father’s very brave soldiers? The senate has just accepted my motion that a discussion be opened at the earliest possible time concerning the commendations and honors due to him, godlike and immortal to match his godlike and immortal services. Who fails to see that Antonius has been pronounced <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>an enemy by this decree? What else can we call him, when the senate decides that exceptional honors must be devised for those who lead armies against him?</p>
