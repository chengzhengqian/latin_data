For he does not, as formerly, desire to make slaves of you; he is angry now and thirsts for your blood. No sport appears more pleasing to him than gore, than carnage, than the slaughter of countrymen before his eyes. You are not dealing, Men of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>Rome, with a wicked villain but with a cruel, hideous monster, who must be overwhelmed inasmuch as he has fallen into a trap.

Cling fast to it, I beg you, Men of Rome, as a heritage bequeathed to you by your ancestors! While all else is false and doubtful, ephemeral and inconstant, only courage stands firmly fixed with its very deep roots, which no violence can ever shake or ever shift from its place. Thereby your ancestors conquered all Italy first, then razed Carthage, overthrew Numantia, brought the most powerful kings and the most warlike nations under the sway of this empire.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_235_4a" id="target_note_LCL189_235_4a"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
