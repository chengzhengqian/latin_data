<p>And what of Decimus Brutus’ judgment, Men of Rome, which you could perceive from his dispatch published today? Do any of you really think it of no account? You say no, Men of Rome, and you are absolutely right! The family and name of the Bruti have been given to the Republic as though by the grace and bounty of the immortal gods whether for the establishment or for the recovery of the freedom of the Roman people. So what was Decimus <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>Brutus’ judgment on Marcus Antonius? He shuts him out of the province; he blocks his path with an army; he urges all Gaul to war, Gaul that is already aroused of her own accord and judgment. If Antonius is a consul, Brutus is an enemy; if Brutus is the savior of the Republic, Antonius is an enemy. Can we at all hesitate between these two propositions?</p>

<p>[4] With one mind and voice you deny that you can; and so the senate has decreed just now that Decimus Brutus deserves especially well of the Republic in defending the authority of the senate and the freedom and empire of the Roman people. Defending from whom? From an enemy of course: what other defense calls for commendation?</p>
<p>Next the province of Gaul is commended and deservedly <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>honored in the most ample terms by the senate because it is resisting Antonius. If that province considered him to be a consul and refused him admittance, it would be guilty of a major crime: for all provinces ought to be under the jurisdiction and authority of a consul.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_231_2" id="target_note_LCL189_231_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Decimus Brutus, imperator and consul-elect, a citizen born for the Republic, denies it, Gaul denies it, all Italy denies it, the senate denies it, you deny it.</p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL189_231_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL189_231_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Technically, consuls were invested with greater power of office than, e.g., propraetors; hence they had the right to appear as generals everywhere and to enter any province on the basis of their traditional <span class="italic">imperium maius</span> (cf. <span class="italic">Att</span>. 8.15.3).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL189_231_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
