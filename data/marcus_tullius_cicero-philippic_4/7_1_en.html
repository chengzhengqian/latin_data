<p>[6] Your ancestors, Men of Rome, had to deal with the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>kind of enemy who possessed a state, a senate, a public treasury, a consensus of like-minded citizens, and a consideration for a treaty of peace, if events had developed that way: this enemy of yours is attacking your state, but he himself has none; he is eager to destroy the senate, the council of the world, but he himself has no public council; he has emptied your treasury, but has none of his own. As for a united citizenry, how can he have that when he has no community? What basis for peace can there be with a person whose cruelty taxes belief and whose good faith is nonexistent? So, Men of Rome, the whole conflict lies between <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>the Roman people, the conqueror of all nations, and an assassin, a bandit, a Spartacus. He likes to boast of his resemblance to Catilina, but though he is his equal in criminality, he is his inferior in energy. Catilina, when he lacked an army, suddenly threw one together: Antonius received an army and lost it. Just as by my exertions, by the senate’s authority, and by your zeal and courage you broke Catilina, even so you will soon be hearing that Antonius’ villainous band of robbers has been crushed through your enormous, unprecedented cooperation with the senate, as well as the good fortune and valor of the armies and generals.</p>
<p>For my part, whatever I can achieve and effect by <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>means of care, toil, wakefulness, influence, and counsel, I shall neglect nothing that in my view concerns your freedom. I should be a criminal if I did, after the signal favors you have lavished upon me.</p>
<p>And today, at the initiative of Marcus Servilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL189_237_5" id="target_note_LCL189_237_5"><sup>5</sup></a> here, a very courageous gentleman who loves you well, and his colleagues, distinguished men and most patriotic citizens, after a long interval, with me to prompt and lead, our hearts have been kindled to hope for liberty.</p>
