Cause, there are once again, of course, three points to be considered: whether it is, what it is, and of what kind it is.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_393_51" id="target_note_LCL125_393_51"><sup>51</sup></a> However, as some Places of Arguments are common to all these, these three types cannot be kept separate, and it is therefore better to deal with all three Types of Issue under the various Places according to the way in which they occur in them.</p>
<p>Arguments, then, may be based on Definition (<span class="italic">finitio</span> or <span class="italic">finis,</span> both terms are traditional). This is of two kinds: either the Definition comes first, and we then ask whether this is Virtue; or we simply ask what Virtue is. We state the Definition either in general terms—“Rhetoric is the science of speaking well”—or by enumerating parts—“Rhetoric is the science of correctly discovering, arranging, and expressing in words, combined with a retentive memory and a dignified delivery.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_393_52" id="target_note_LCL125_393_52"><sup>52</sup></a> Further we may define a word either by its significance (as in the above example) or by Etymology: for instance <span class="italic">assiduus</span> from <span class="italic">as</span> and <span class="italic">do,</span> “giving money,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_393_53a" id="target_note_LCL125_393_53a"><sup>53</sup></a> <span class="italic">locuples</span> from the abundance of “places” (<span class="italic">loca</span>), and <span class="italic">pecuniosus</span> from abundance of cattle (<span class="italic">pecus</span>).</p>
<p>The elements which seem particularly to belong to Definition are Genus, Species, Difference, and Property. Arguments may be derived from all these. (1) Genus is little use in proving Species, but very useful for eliminating it. An object is not a plane because it is a tree, but what is not a tree certainly cannot be a plane; a quality which is a virtue is not necessarily justice, but what is not a virtue certainly

Aelius Stilo; the word is usually taken to come from <span class="italic">ad</span> + <span class="italic">sedere,</span> “sitting close to.” However, a passage in the Twelve Tables (<span class="italic">ROL</span> 3. 426 = Gellius 16.10.5) clearly contrasts <span class="italic">adsiduus,</span> a “settler,” with a citizen who is <span class="italic">proletarius</span>; and if wealth is a mark of the “settler,” Aelius’ etymology has point (I owe this note to Tobias Reinhardt).
