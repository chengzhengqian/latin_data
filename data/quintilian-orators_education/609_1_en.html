<span class="label"><span class="italic">The primary virtue of good Latin</span></span>
<p>What the Greeks call <span class="italic">phrasis</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_325_1" id="target_note_LCL126_325_1"><sup>1</sup></a> we call <span class="italic">elocutio</span> in Latin. It is studied both in individual words and in words taken together. In individual words, we need to ensure that they are good Latin, clear, elegant, and well adapted to our purpose. Grouped words must be correct, &lt;appropriately&gt; arranged, and figured. I have already, in discussing <span class="italic">grammaticē</span> in Book One, said what was necessary about the principles of speaking pure and correct Latin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_325_2" id="target_note_LCL126_325_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But there, my advice bore only on avoiding faults; here it is relevant to warn that there should be as few non-Roman or foreign words as possible. One can find many speakers, not lacking in linguistic understanding, whose style may be said to be pedantic rather than Latin. Think of the old Athenian woman who addressed the very eloquent Theophrastus as “Stranger,” because she noticed a peculiarity in one word; and when she was asked how she caught him out, she said it was because he spoke too good Attic.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_325_3" id="target_note_LCL126_325_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Again Asinius Pollio thinks there is a certain “Patavinity” in Livy, who was a man of marvellous eloquence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_325_4" id="target_note_LCL126_325_4"><sup>4</sup></a> If possible, then, let all our words and our pronunciation have a whiff of city breeding, so that our speech seems to be native Roman, not simply naturalized.</p>
