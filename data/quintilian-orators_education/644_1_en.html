<p>criminal); if he had merely been killed, there would have been more stages; but having said “to put him to death is little short of parricide”—and there is nothing to cap this—he added “what shall I say about putting him on the cross?” Thus, when he had already used the strongest word, words were bound to fail him for the stage beyond.</p>
<p>There is another way of going beyond the highest degree, exemplified in Vergil’s description of Lausus:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent2">than whom was none more beautiful,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">except Laurentian Turnus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_395_4" id="target_note_LCL126_395_4"><sup>4</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Here “than whom was none more beautiful” gives us the highest point, and then something is made to cap this.</p>
<p>There is also a third type, not reached by going step by step, but one &lt;in which what is stated&gt; is not the stage above the greatest, but something which has no superior at all: “You beat your mother. What more can I say? You beat your mother.” For to make something so great that it cannot be increased is itself another form of Increment.</p>
<p>A less obvious, but perhaps therefore more effective, form is found when a succession of details, each stronger than the last, occurs in a continuous passage without any break in the sentence. An example is Cicero’s description of Antony’s vomiting:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_395_5" id="target_note_LCL126_395_5"><sup>5</sup></a> “in an assembly of the people of Rome, while doing public business, while Master of the Horse.” Each phrase marks an Increment. Vomiting is revolting even when not in an assembly, revolting in an assembly, even if not an assembly of the people, revolting in an assembly of the people, even if it were not the people of Rome; revolting if he was doing no business, revolting if he was doing business but not public business, revolting
