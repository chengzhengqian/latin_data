should be put all together or divided up. (i) If the damaging points are more numerous, the advantageous ones will be smothered by them. So in this case it is best to divide, and, after setting out and confirming the points which help our Cause, to use the palliatives spoken of above<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_271_64" id="target_note_LCL125_271_64"><sup>64</sup></a> to counter the others. (ii) If the better points predominate, it will be open to us to make the Narrative one continuous whole, so that the problematic items have less force, because they will be surrounded, as it were, by our auxiliaries.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_271_65" id="target_note_LCL125_271_65"><sup>65</sup></a> But none of these points should be set out baldly, but in such a way that we confirm ours with some form of Argumentation and add reasons for disbelieving what the other side says. If we do not make this distinction, it is to be feared that our good things may be infected by the admixture of the bad.</p>

<p>Here are some other common rules for Narrative: no Digression, no Apostrophe, no Prosopopoeia, no Argumentation. Some add, no Appeals to the Emotions. Most of these prohibitions are normally to be observed, or rather only breached when there is a compelling reason.</p>
<p>If a Narrative is to be clear and brief, nothing can be justified as rarely as a Digression; and if there is ever to be one, it must be short and such that we seem to have been driven off course by the violence of our feelings. Thus Cicero on Sasia’s marriage:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_271_66" id="target_note_LCL125_271_66"><sup>66</sup></a> “The incredible wickedness of the woman!
