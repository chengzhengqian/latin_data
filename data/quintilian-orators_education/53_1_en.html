More recent scholars however have started to give Greek names Greek declensions, though this is sometimes impossible. My preference is for following the Latin rule as far as elegance allows. I should not care to say <span class="italic">Calypsonem</span> on the analogy of <span class="italic">Iunonem,</span> though Caesar, following ancient precedents, uses this form.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_155_76" id="target_note_LCL124_155_76"><sup>76</sup></a> Usage has now prevailed over Authority. In other instances, where words can be declined in either way without loss of elegance, anyone who prefers to follow the Greek form will not be speaking Latin, but he can hardly be blamed.</p>

<p>Simple words consist of their primary, i.e. natural, form: compounds either (1) are formed by adding a prefix, as in <span class="italic">innocens</span> (with the proviso that two mutually incompatible prefixes must not be used, as in <span class="italic">imperterritus</span>;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_155_77" id="target_note_LCL124_155_77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
