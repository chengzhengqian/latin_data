<p>There is also something called a “closure.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_415_22" id="target_note_LCL126_415_22"><sup>22</sup></a> If this is what we call a “conclusion,” it is a correct and sometimes necessary device: “You must therefore first confess your own offences before you accuse Ligarius of anything.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_415_23" id="target_note_LCL126_415_23"><sup>23</sup></a> Nowadays, however, something more is wanted, namely that every passage, every sentence, should strike the ear with its final phrase. Speakers think it a disgrace, almost a crime, to pause for breath at any point which does not call for applause. Hence a lot of little sentences, fragmented, affected, and irrelevant; for there cannot be as many good <span class="italic">sententiae</span> as there must be closures!</p>
<p>Here now are some more modern types of <span class="italic">sententia</span>:</p>
<p>(1) Based on surprise: Vibius Crispus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_415_24" id="target_note_LCL126_415_24"><sup>24</sup></a> said to a man who was walking in the forum in body armour and claimed he was doing it because he was afraid, “Afraid? Who gave you permission?” Another distinguished example is Africanus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_415_25" id="target_note_LCL126_415_25"><sup>25</sup></a> remark to Nero about his mother’s death, “Caesar, your provinces of Gaul beg that you will bear your happiness like a man.”</p>
<p>(2) Alluding to other events: Domitius Afer, defending Cloatilla,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_415_26" id="target_note_LCL126_415_26"><sup>26</sup></a> whom Claudius had pardoned when she had been charged with having buried her husband (who had taken part in a rebellion), addressed her sons in his Epilogue
