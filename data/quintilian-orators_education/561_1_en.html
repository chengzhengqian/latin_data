set up two Definitions, and these must be the best possible on each side. In the courts, on the other hand, we have to guard against giving a Definition which is perhaps unnecessary, irrelevant, ambiguous, against our interests, or equally good for both sides; none of these things can happen except through the pleader’s fault. A correct Definition will be assured if we first decide in our own mind what we want to effect; it will then be possible to suit the wording to our purpose. To make the matter clearer, let me stick with a very familiar example:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_229_24" id="target_note_LCL126_229_24"><sup>24</sup></a> “A man who has stolen private money from a temple is accused of sacrilege.” His guilt is plain: the question is whether the name given in the law fits his offence. It is therefore for debate whether this act is sacrilege. The accuser uses the word, on the ground that it was from a temple that the money was stolen. The defendant denies sacrilege but admits theft, on the ground that the money he stole was private. The prosecutor will therefore give the Definition “Sacrilege is stealing something &lt;from a sacred place”; the defendant will say “Sacrilege is stealing something&gt; sacred.” Each impugns the other’s Definition. Now there are two ways of demolishing a Definition: it may be either false or not complete. (There is a third ground, irrelevance to the question; but this only happens to fools.) [It is a false Definition if you say, “A horse is a rational animal,” because a horse is an animal but not rational. What is common to something else will cease to be a Property.] In our example, the defendant says that the accuser’s Definition is false, but the accuser cannot say this of the defendant’s (for sacrilege <span class="italic">is</span> “to steal something sacred”) but he can say that it is incomplete, because it is necessary to add “or from a sacred place.”</p>
