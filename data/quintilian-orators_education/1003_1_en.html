<span class="label"><span class="italic">When should the orator’s career begin?</span></span>
<p class="noindent">The moment at which to begin a career must of course be chosen with regard to the individual’s abilities. I shall not specify any particular age. It is well known that Demosthenes pleaded against his guardians when he was still quite a boy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_251_1" id="target_note_LCL494_251_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and that Calvus, Caesar, and Pollio all undertook important cases before they were old enough to hold the quaestorship;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_251_2" id="target_note_LCL494_251_2"><sup>2</sup></a> others are said to have pleaded as <span class="italic">praetextati</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_251_3" id="target_note_LCL494_251_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and Augustus gave the funeral eulogy for his grandmother from the rostra at the age of twelve.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_251_4" id="target_note_LCL494_251_4"><sup>4</sup></a> I think we should aim at a happy mean. On the one hand, the leaf must not be hastily stripped before its time, nor whatever acid matter is still in it put out as fodder,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_251_5" id="target_note_LCL494_251_5"><sup>5</sup></a> because this is how contempt for the profession arises, the foundations of impudence are laid, and (worst of all, wherever it occurs) confidence comes to outstrip capacity. On the other hand, it is wrong to postpone the apprenticeship till old age, because fear grows day by day, the task we are to embark upon gets bigger and bigger, and, while we are debating when to begin, it is already too late to do so. It is right, therefore, to bring out the fruit of our education while it is still fresh and sweet, while there is still indulgence and hope, while a friendly reception is assured, boldness is not unbecoming, youth makes up for deficiencies in the work,</p>
