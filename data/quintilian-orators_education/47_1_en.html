<p>A more learned question is whether a Solecism can also occur in a single word, if (for example) one summons a single person with the word <span class="italic">venite,</span> or dismisses a group of people by saying <span class="italic">abi</span> or <span class="italic">discede,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_143_44" id="target_note_LCL124_143_44"><sup>44</sup></a> or again when the answer does not agree with the questioner’s intention, as when someone asks “Whom do I see?” and you answer “I.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_143_45" id="target_note_LCL124_143_45"><sup>45</sup></a> Some believe that the same fault can be detected in gesture, when the message conveyed by the nod or the hand is different from that conveyed by the voice. I neither subscribe completely to this view nor totally disagree with it. I admit that a Solecism may occur in a single word, but only if there is something else, tantamount to another word, to which the single word can be referred, so that the Solecism arises from the combination of the different means by which the facts are expressed and the intention displayed. To avoid any quibbling, let us assume that it can sometimes occur in one word, but never in a word quite by itself.</p>
<p>The number and nature of the kinds of Solecism are not entirely agreed. Those who have discussed it most fully make a fourfold classification, as with Barbarism: (1) by addition (<span class="italic">nam enim, de susum, in Alexandriam</span>); (2) by omission (<span class="italic">ambulo viam, Aegypto venio, ne hoc fecit</span>); (3) by transposition (<span class="italic">quoque ego, enim hoc voluit, autem non habuit</span>).
