<p>Aristotle in the <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_75_51" id="target_note_LCL125_75_51"><sup>51</sup></a> thinks that the questions to be asked are: Does it exist? What is it like? How big? How much? But in one passage<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_75_52" id="target_note_LCL125_75_52"><sup>52</sup></a> he recognizes the notion of Definition also, when he speaks of defences such as “I took it, but I did not commit theft” or “I struck him, but I did not commit an assault.”</p>
<p>Cicero again in his <span class="italic">Rhetorica</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_75_53" id="target_note_LCL125_75_53"><sup>53</sup></a> had assumed four Issues: of Fact, of Name, of Kind, and of Legal Process. By Fact is meant Conjecture; by Name, Definition; by Kind, Quality; and by Legal Process, Law. He had put Transference under Law. In another passage,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_75_54" id="target_note_LCL125_75_54"><sup>54</sup></a> however, he treats Legal Questions also as a branch of Process.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Theories of five or more Issues</span></span>
<p>Some writers made out five: Conjecture, Definition, Quality, Quantity, Relation. Theodorus also, as I said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_75_55" id="target_note_LCL125_75_55"><sup>55</sup></a> adopts the same general headings: Does it exist? What is it? What is it like? How big is it? Is it relative to something? This last he considers to be mainly concerned with Comparison, since “better,” “worse,” “greater,” and “less” are only understood by reference to something else. But, as I have already indicated, it also enters into Questions of Transference: Does this man have a right of action? Is it right for him to do a certain thing? Against this man? At this time? In this way? All these points must involve reference to something else.</p>
