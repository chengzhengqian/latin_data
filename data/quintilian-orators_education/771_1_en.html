Some Hyperbata, however, are both too long (as I said in the preceding Books)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_177_20" id="target_note_LCL127_177_20"><sup>20</sup></a> and sometimes also faulty in Composition. I mean those which are sought solely to achieve an effect of extravagance and licence, like the ones in Maecenas:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_177_21" id="target_note_LCL127_177_21"><sup>21</sup></a> “With sun and dawn they blush full,” “The water moved holy between the ash trees,” “Not even funeral would I, one among the most wretched, see my own.” (This last is the worst of the lot, because the Composition trivializes a serious subject.)</p>
<p>However, there is often a powerful significance in a single word; if this is then concealed in the middle of a sentence, it tends to escape attention and be overshadowed by its surroundings, whereas if it is placed at the end it is impressed upon the hearer and fixed in his mind, as in Cicero’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_177_22" id="target_note_LCL127_177_22"><sup>22</sup></a> “so that you were obliged to vomit in the sight of the Roman people <span class="italic">the day after.</span>” Move the last word and it will lose its force. This is the sharp end of the whole passage, as it were: Antony’s need to vomit, disgusting in itself, acquires the further hideousness—not expected by the audience—that he could not keep his food down <span class="italic">the day after.</span> Domitius Afer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_177_23" id="target_note_LCL127_177_23"><sup>23</sup></a> used to transfer words to sentenceends solely to roughen his Composition. He did this especially in Prooemia, as in <span class="italic">Pro Cloatilla</span> (“I will give thanks <span class="italic">at once</span>”) and in <span class="italic">Pro Laelia</span> (“because of both these facts, before you as a judge, the person at risk is <span class="italic">Laelia</span>”). He avoided the voluptuousness of soft and delicate rhythm so conscientiously that, when his rhythms ran on spontaneously, he would put obstacles in to check them.</p>
