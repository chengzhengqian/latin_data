normal but expressive words—not vulgar of course, but not out of the way and recondite either—and, secondly, if it gives a distinct view of facts, persons, times, places, and causes; the delivery must be designed to ensure that the judge takes in what is said as easily as possible. This last virtue is neglected by the many speakers who have prepared themselves for the applause of a large audience stationed there for the purpose (or perhaps even turning up by chance), and thus cannot bear the silence that indicates attention, or believe in their own competence unless they have made the whole place rock with noise and clamour. To state the facts is, they think, a subject for ordinary conversational speech, well within the powers even of an uneducated person; and yet one cannot be certain whether they lack the will to do the thing they despise as so easy, or the capacity! However comprehensive their experience of eloquence, they will never find anything harder than the thing that everyone, on hearing it, thinks he could have said himself, because he judges it not to be well put, but only to be true. Now the real orator speaks best when he seems to be speaking the truth. In our day, however, speakers take the Narrative as offering, as it were, a free field, and choose this as the best moment to flex the voice, throw back the head, thump the sides, and indulge in every possible play of ideas and words and Composition. Hence the topsy-turvy consequence that the performance pleases, and the Cause remains unintelligible. But let us say no more about this, lest the offence I give by rebuking bad practice outweigh any favour that my good advice may earn!</p>
