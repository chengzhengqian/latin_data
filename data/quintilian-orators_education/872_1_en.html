This is the principle behind the tricks jugglers and conjurers perform on the stage, which make one imagine that the objects they throw fly into their hands of their own accord and go just where they are bidden. But this knack will only be useful if it is based on the art of which we have spoken, so that an intrinsically irrational activity comes to be grounded on reason. Anyone who does not speak in an orderly, formal, and fluent manner is not, to my mind, speaking at all, but only ranting. It is never a surprise to me that random talk shows coherence (we see that in abundance even in squabbling women)—after all, once the heat of inspiration takes over, it often happens that deliberate effort cannot rival the success of an improvisation. The older orators, as Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_379_5" id="target_note_LCL127_379_5"><sup>5</sup></a> says, used to say, when this happened, that a god was present, but in fact the reason is obvious. Deeply felt emotions and fresh images of things sweep along uninterruptedly, but the delay of writing sometimes cools them down, and once put aside they never return.
