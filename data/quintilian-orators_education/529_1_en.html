was mine.” The first three can be dropped, but not the last.</p>
<p>Another practice of mine was either to proceed backwards from the final specialization (which is the one which normally forms the Core of the Cause) to the first General Question, or else to descend from the Genus to the final specialization; I would do this even in deliberative exercises. For example: Numa deliberates whether to accept the kingship offered by the Romans.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_165_16" id="target_note_LCL126_165_16"><sup>16</sup></a> First (the Genus), should one be king? Secondly, should one be king in a foreign city? Thirdly, should one be king in Rome? And will the Romans tolerate such a king? Similarly in forensic themes. Suppose a war hero chooses as his reward another man’s wife. Final specialization is: is he able to ask for another man’s wife as his choice? The generic point is whether he should receive whatever he asks for. Then comes (1) whether he can ask for private property, (2) whether he can ask for marriage, (3) whether he can ask for marriage to a woman who has a husband. But the order of asking these Questions is not the order of speaking. Normally, indeed, the first thing that comes to mind is the thing to be said last (here it is “You ought not to choose another man’s wife”), and so haste spoils the Division. We must therefore not be satisfied with the ideas that present themselves, but look for something beyond them: “not even a widow.” A further stage is “no private property.” The last stage, working backwards, which is also the first starting from the logical beginning, is “nothing unfair.”</p>
<p>Thus, having noted the other side’s proposition (this is the easiest part), let us consider, if possible, what is naturally the first response. This will come to mind if we choose to look at it as if &lt;our own&gt; case was being pleaded and we
