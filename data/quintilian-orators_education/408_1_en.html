For example, if you are talking about the cultivation of the mind, you can use the image of the earth, which produces thorns and thickets if it is neglected, and fruits if it is cultivated. Or again, if you were encouraging someone to take up public service, you could show that bees and ants, which are not only dumb animals but are very tiny, nevertheless work together in common. There is an example of this in Cicero: “As our bodies cannot use their parts without the mind, so a state cannot use its parts—its sinews, blood, and limbs, as it were—without the law.” This image of the human body is in <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio</span>;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_445_35" id="target_note_LCL125_445_35"><sup>35</sup></a> he has one from horses in <span class="italic">Pro Cornelio</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_445_36" id="target_note_LCL125_445_36"><sup>36</sup></a> and one from stones in <span class="italic">Pro Archia.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_445_37" id="target_note_LCL125_445_37"><sup>37</sup></a> Closer (as I said) is, for instance, “Soldiers are no good without a general, like rowers without a steersman.”</p>
<p>However, with Similitudes, appearances can be deceptive, and so judgement must be applied. A new ship is more serviceable than an old one; not so friendship. A woman who is generous with her money is to be praised; not so, if she is generous with her person. In these instances, the words “old” and “generous” are similar, but their force is very different with &lt;“ship” from what it is with “friendship”&gt;, and with “money” from what it is with “chastity.”</p>
