<p>So what is this instructor’s duty? In the first place he must correct any faults of enunciation, so that words are clearly pronounced and the proper sound is given to each letter. There are some letters which we have a bad tendency to make too thin or too full; others we stifle as too harsh, and replace by similar but duller-sounding ones. For instance, <span class="italic">lambda</span> is substituted for <span class="italic">rho,</span> with which even Demosthenes had difficulty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_239_3" id="target_note_LCL124_239_3"><sup>3</sup></a> (We have the equivalents of these letters in our own language.)

He will also make sure that final syllables are not lost, that the speech maintains an even level, that when the voice has to be raised the effort comes from the lungs and not from the head, and that the gesture is appropriate to the voice and the facial expression to the gesture.
