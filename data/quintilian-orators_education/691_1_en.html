simple form; the analogy is now with sitting, bending forwards, or looking back. So when a speaker falls continually, or at least too often, into the same cases, tenses, rhythms, or even feet, we usually advise him to vary his “Figures” so as to avoid monotony. Here we are speaking as if all language had a “Figure.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_17_11" id="target_note_LCL127_17_11"><sup>11</sup></a> Again <span class="italic">cursitare</span> and <span class="italic">lectitare</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_17_12" id="target_note_LCL127_17_12"><sup>12</sup></a> are held to be in the same “Figure,” that is to say, to be inflected in the same way. Thus, according to the first and usual interpretation of the word, there is nothing which is not “figured.” If we are happy with this, there is merit in Apollodorus’ view (if we can believe Caecilius’ report of it) that the rules for this part of our subject are “beyond our power to grasp.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_17_13" id="target_note_LCL127_17_13"><sup>13</sup></a> If on the other hand we are to give the name to specific attitudes and gestures, as it were, then we must limit the scope of <span class="italic">schema</span> in this context to that which is poetically or rhetorically varied from the simple and immediately available means of expression. It will then be true that figureless (<span class="italic">aschēmatistos</span>) style is one thing (and it is then a serious fault), and figured (<span class="italic">eschēmatismen</span>ē) style another. Zoilus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_17_14" id="target_note_LCL127_17_14"><sup>14</sup></a> however narrowed down even this definition, because he thought that a <span class="italic">schēma</span> was found only where the speaker pretends to be saying something which he is not saying. This is also, I know, a common view; it is the basis on which some <span class="italic">controversiae</span> are said to be “figured.” I shall say something about these later.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_17_15" id="target_note_LCL127_17_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Let us then take a Figure to be an innovative form of expression produced by some artistic means.</p>
