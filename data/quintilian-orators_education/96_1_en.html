<p>also take care that the speaker faces his audience, that his lips are not distorted, nor his mouth split open in a wide grin, that his face is not turned upwards, his eyes fixed on the ground, or his neck turned to one side. The forehead can go wrong in many ways: I have seen many who raised their eyebrows at every effort of their voice, others whose brows were always bent, others again who could not keep them level, one making its way towards the top of the head, and the other almost covering the eye itself. As we shall observe later,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_241_6" id="target_note_LCL124_241_6"><sup>6</sup></a> even these little things are matters of infinite moment; and nothing can give pleasure which is not becoming.</p>
<p>Our actor will also have to teach how to deliver a narrative, how to lend authority to advice, what stimulus to use in order to produce a surge of anger, what change of tone is appropriate to an appeal to pity. The best way he can do this is by choosing particular passages from comedy which are most suitable for the purpose, that is, most resembling actual pleadings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_241_7" id="target_note_LCL124_241_7"><sup>7</sup></a> These are not only very useful for training in Delivery, but will prove admirably adapted to develop a speaker’s eloquence. All this should be done while the child is not yet strong enough to undertake more serious exercises; but when he has to read speeches, and begins to appreciate their merits, he should then have available to him some careful and experienced teacher, not only to train his reading, but to force him to learn select passages by heart and repeat them standing, clearly and in the way he will one day have to plead; this will train Delivery, voice, and Memory at a single stroke.</p>
