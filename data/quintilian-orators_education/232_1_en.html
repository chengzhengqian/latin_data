Thus every case will turn on the same elements, though the two sides will sometimes be reversed; in cases involving rewards, for example, it is the petitioner who has to prove that the act was rightly done.</p>
<p>These four schemes or forms of action, as it were, which I then called General Issues, fall, as I have shown, into two main classes, the Logical and the Legal. The Logical is the simpler, as it involves merely observation of nature herself. Here therefore it is enough to point to Conjecture, Definition, and Quality. Of Legal Issues there are inevitably more varieties, because there are many laws and they have various forms. We rely on the letter of one, on the intention of another; others we harness to our cause, though we have no law really on our side; sometimes we compare one law with another, sometimes we give different interpretations. So from those three basic Issues there arise these shadows of them, as it were, sometimes simple, sometimes complex, but with their own peculiar features. Such are Letter and Spirit, which is unquestionably based either on Quality or on Conjecture; Inference, which generally depends on Quality; Conflict of Laws, which has the same structure as Letter and Spirit; and <span class="italic">amphibolia</span> (Ambiguity), which is always a matter of Conjecture. Definition also belongs to both classes—the class concerned with the consideration of facts and that concerned with that of written law. All these variations, even if they fall under the three basic Issues, have (as I have said) some peculiarities of their own, and should therefore be explained
