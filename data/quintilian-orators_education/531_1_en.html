<p>In general, massing the charges together helps the prosecution, dividing them helps the defence.</p>
<p>I used also to apply to the whole material of a case the procedure I described with reference to Arguments,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_169_19" id="target_note_LCL126_169_19"><sup>19</sup></a> namely to set out all the possibilities, leaving nothing out, and then to exclude all except the one which I wanted to be believed.
