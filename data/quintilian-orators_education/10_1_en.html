<p>the triumvirs by Hortensia, the daughter of Quintus Hortensius, is still read—and not just because it is by a woman.)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_69_6" id="target_note_LCL124_69_6"><sup>6</sup></a> However, those who have not been lucky enough to learn themselves should not for that reason take less trouble about their sons’ teaching; on the contrary, it should make them all the more careful in other matters.</p>
<p>As to the slave boys with whom the child born to such high hopes is to be brought up,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_69_7" id="target_note_LCL124_69_7"><sup>7</sup></a> I would repeat what I said about the nurses.

Nothing can be worse than those who, having got just beyond the alphabet, delude themselves that they have acquired some knowledge. They both scorn to give up the role of instructor and, conceiving that they have a certain title to authority (a frequent source of vanity in this class of persons), become imperious and sometimes even brutal teachers of their own foolishness. Their failings have an equally bad moral effect: Alexander’s <span class="italic">paedogogus,</span> Leonides, according to Diogenes of Babylon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_69_9" id="target_note_LCL124_69_9"><sup>9</sup></a> infected him with some faults which clung to him as a result of his childhood education even when he was a grown man and had become a mighty king.</p>
