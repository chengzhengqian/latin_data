his duty had placed him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_45_57" id="target_note_LCL494_45_57"><sup>57</sup></a> Sometimes, again, it becomes us to spare (or to seem to spare) our inferiors, and especially the very young. Cicero illustrates this moderation in his treatment of Atratinus in <span class="italic">Pro Caelio</span>, where he seems not to be attacking him as an enemy but admonishing him almost like a father. Atratinus was of noble birth and young, and had a perfectly good grievance to justify the prosecution.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_45_58" id="target_note_LCL494_45_58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>The task is comparatively easy when it is to the judge or indeed to the audience that we have to give proof of our moderation. It is more difficult when we are fearful of offending our opponents. Cicero in defending Murena had two such persons opposed to him at the same time, Marcus Cato and Servius Sulpicius. And yet how appropriately, after granting Sulpicius every virtue, does he proceed to deny him the understanding of how to run for the consulship!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_45_59" id="target_note_LCL494_45_59"><sup>59</sup></a> What else could make it easier for an aristocrat and a leading lawyer to admit defeat?

And with what a delicate touch did he handle Cato! He had the highest regard for Cato’s character, and wanted it to appear that its new hardness in some respects was the fault not of Cato himself but of the Stoic school; you might think you had lighted on a learned disputation between them, not an argument in court!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_45_60" id="target_note_LCL494_45_60"><sup>60</sup></a> So the principle, and Cicero’s own practice (〈which is〉 the surest kind of rule), is that if you want to disparage a man in some respect, and yet keep his good will, you should grant him everything else, and then say that there is just one thing in
