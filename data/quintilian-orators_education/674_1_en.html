and a little breath of rumour sometimes reverses the whole trend of opinion.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_455_72" id="target_note_LCL126_455_72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Another very important rule to observe in Allegory is to finish with the same type of Metaphor with which you began. Many begin with a storm and end with a fire or the collapse of a house; this is a horrible incongruity.</p>
<p>Again, Allegory is often put to use by men of no great talent and in everyday speech. The now hackneyed phrases of pleading in court, “hand-to-hand fighting” and “going for the jugular” and “letting blood,” come under this head, but they do not cause any offence. It is novelty and change that we enjoy in language, and what is unexpected gives the greater pleasure. This is why we have nowadays lost our sense of proportion in these matters, and exhausted the charm of the thing by striving too hard for it.</p>
<p>There is also a type of Allegory which consists in Examples, if these are not preceded by an explanation. All the Greeks make use of “Dionysius is at Corinth”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_455_73" id="target_note_LCL126_455_73"><sup>73</sup></a> and there are many similar sayings which can be so used. When an Allegory is too obscure, however, we call it an Enigma. It is a fault in my opinion, seeing that Lucidity is a virtue of speech, but the poets use it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
