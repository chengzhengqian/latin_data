question relating to persons in servitude for debt.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_397_56" id="target_note_LCL125_397_56"><sup>56</sup></a> “If a slave is manumitted, he becomes a freedman; not so a person in servitude.” (There are other points like this, which I shall deal with later.)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_397_57" id="target_note_LCL125_397_57"><sup>57</sup></a> It is also said to be a Differentia when the Genus is divided into Species and the Species itself is characterized. “Animal” is the Genus, “mortal” the Species, “terrestrial” or “biped” the Differentia. They are not yet Properties, but they do already mark a difference from “marine” or “quadruped.” This is not however as relevant to Argument as it is to the accuracy and completeness of the Definition. Cicero separates Genus and Species (which he also calls Form) from Definition and includes them under Relation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_397_58" id="target_note_LCL125_397_58"><sup>58</sup></a> For example, if the person who has been bequeathed “all the silver” claimed the silver coin as well, he would base his claim on Genus; on the other hand, if a legacy is left by a husband to a woman who was <span class="italic">materfamilias</span> in his household, and it is denied that the legacy is due to a woman who has never come into her husband’s legal power, the argument is from Species, because there are two types of marriage.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_397_59a" id="target_note_LCL125_397_59a"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Cicero also points out<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_397_60" id="target_note_LCL125_397_60"><sup>60</sup></a> that Division is an aid to Definition, and that it differs from Partition, inasmuch as Partition breaks up a whole into parts, while Division breaks up a Genus into Forms: the number of parts (on his view) is uncertain (“what elements make up the state?”) whereas the number of Forms is certain (“how many species of states are there? We are told there are three, namely those governed by the people, by a few, and by one man”).</p>
