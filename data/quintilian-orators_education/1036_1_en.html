<p>important Causes? Homer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_317_91" id="target_note_LCL494_317_91"><sup>91</sup></a> gave Menelaus an eloquence which is concise, pleasing and precise (this is what he means by “not straying in speech”) and without any super-fluities: these are the virtues of the first type. From Nestor’s lips, he tells us, flowed speech sweeter than honey; we can conceive no greater pleasure. But when he comes to express the supreme eloquence, in Ulysses, he gives him a mighty voice, and a force of speech “like a 〈winter〉 blizzard” in its volume and violence. So “no mortal will contend” with him, and “men will look upon him as a god.” This is the force and speed that Eupolis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_317_92" id="target_note_LCL494_317_92"><sup>92</sup></a> admires in Pericles and Aristophanes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_317_93" id="target_note_LCL494_317_93"><sup>93</sup></a> likens to the thunderbolt. This is in truth the power of speech.</p>
<p>But eloquence is not limited to these three patterns, as we may call them. Just as a third type was inserted between the slender and the strong, so also there are intervals between the three, and in these intervals is found a style which is a blend of those on either side. Thus we find something fuller or plainer than the plain, more relaxed or more vehement than the vehement, while the smooth style may either rise to greater strength or decline towards the slighter extreme. So an almost infinite number of species can be found, all differing from one another in some respect. So also with the winds: we learn that, in general terms, there are four, blowing from the four cardinal points, but really there are many in between, which have their own names and are in some cases peculiar to certain</p>
