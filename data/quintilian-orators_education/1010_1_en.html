a long and eloquent speech to great applause (though it has no relevance either for the judge or for the client), they are escorted home through the forum, bathed in sweat and with their admirers all around them.</p>
<p>I have no patience either with the fastidious airs of those who order their friends to take instructions, though there is less harm in this if the friends learn the facts properly and pass them on properly. But who can get up the Cause as well as the advocate himself? How will the go-between, the litigation middleman and interpreter, as it were, have the patience to expend effort on other men’s pleadings, when the speaker himself does not think his own worth the trouble?</p>
<p>It is extremely bad practice to be content with written statements, whether composed by the litigant (who has had recourse to a counsel just because he is not competent to conduct the case himself) or by one of that type of advocates who admit that they are incapable of pleading, but then proceed to undertake the most difficult part of that operation. If a man is able to decide what is to be said, what concealed, what avoided, changed, or even made up, why should he not be the orator himself, seeing that he is doing something far harder, namely making another person an orator? Moreover, these people would not do so much harm if they wrote down everything just as it happened. As it is, however, they add motives and “colours” and points which are more damaging than the truth. Most advocates, when presented with this material, think it wrong to make changes, but keep closely to it, as though it was a theme set in school; and then they are caught out, and learn from their opponents the Cause which they were not prepared to learn from their clients.</p>
