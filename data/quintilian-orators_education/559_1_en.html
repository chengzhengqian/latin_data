formulation. But these are matters for discussion, not for litigation.</p>
<p>On occasion, Definitions are needed to explain obscure or unknown words (what is meant by <span class="italic">clarigatio,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_225_15" id="target_note_LCL126_225_15"><sup>15</sup></a> <span class="italic">erctum citum</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_225_16" id="target_note_LCL126_225_16"><sup>16</sup></a>) or sometimes even familiar words (what is meant by <span class="italic">penus,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_225_17" id="target_note_LCL126_225_17"><sup>17</sup></a> <span class="italic">litus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_225_18" id="target_note_LCL126_225_18"><sup>18</sup></a>).</p>
<p>This variety has caused some writers to include Definition under Conjecture, others under Quality, others under Legal Questions. Some indeed entirely reject this subtle form of argument, modelled as it is on the methods of dialectic, and regard it as acute verbal sophistry for use in debate rather than as likely to be a significant contribution to the business of the orator. For, though in a dialogue Definition may be effective enough to tie the respondent down in chains of his own making and force him to be silent or even to give reluctant assent to something which goes against his case, it has not the same usefulness in Causes. For there we have to persuade the judge, who, even if he surrenders to the words, will continue to disagree tacitly unless he has assented to the actual facts. And what need has a pleader of such precision of definition? Even without saying “Man is a mortal and rational animal,” can I not set out all the properties of mind and body at greater length, and so draw a distinction between man and the gods or the dumb animals? Again, the same thing can be defined both by a single word (as Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_225_19" id="target_note_LCL126_225_19"><sup>19</sup></a> does: “What is meant by ‘commonly’? ‘Everybody’”) and by a wider,
