<span class="italic">iunctura</span> in 32–44, and <span class="italic">numeri</span> (much the most complex) in 45–111. There is much obscurity in Quintilian’s theory; his main point however seems to be that <span class="italic">oratorical</span> rhythm (57) is distinct not only from metre but from rhythm found in other arts (music, dancing, as well as poetry), because it admits more variety and freedom. This section includes advice on avoiding complete lines of verse (72–78) and on the uses of various metrical feet (79–111). Many of the judgements given in this section seem capricious. Characteristically, Quintilian rounds all this off by a warning against pedantic observance of rules; nature is a better guide than art to what sounds right (112–120).</p>
<p>All this applies generally to any kind of prose writing. Quintilian now comes to the special needs of oratory. He first (122–130) considers the use of <span class="italic">commata</span> (a staccato style), <span class="italic">cola</span> (also quite brief units), and full periods in the various parts of a speech; thus, for example, the best places for elaborate periods are Prooemium and Epilogue. Finally (130–137) we learn which metrical feet are appropriate in particular contexts or for particular levels of emotion.</p>
<p>There follows (137) a somewhat mysterious criticism of Celsus (see note ad loc.) and a final summary, showing the relation between <span class="italic">compositio</span> and Delivery, and (once again) the need to keep appropriateness to context constantly in mind. The reference to Delivery looks forward to 11.3; but Quintilian has much ground to cover first.</p>
