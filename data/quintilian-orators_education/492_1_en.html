and “Tollius” for “Tullius” because he was a thief.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_91_47" id="target_note_LCL126_91_47"><sup>47</sup></a> This sort of joke answers better with things than with names. It was clever of Afer to say of Manlius Sura,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_91_48" id="target_note_LCL126_91_48"><sup>48</sup></a> who used to run around, leap about, throw up his hands, and keep dropping and putting back his toga while he was speaking, that he was not acting for his client but over-acting. “Over-acting” (<span class="italic">satagere</span>) is an “urbane” word by itself, even if there were no play on the other word.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_91_49" id="target_note_LCL126_91_49"><sup>49</sup></a> Similar jokes (usually feeble, but occasionally acceptable) are produced by adding or removing an aspirate or dividing or joining words. Jokes drawn from names follow the same pattern. Cicero has much of this kind in his attack on Verres,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_91_50" id="target_note_LCL126_91_50"><sup>50</sup></a> but always as quotations from someone else: “he would <span class="italic">sweep</span> (<span class="italic">verreret</span>) all away,” “he had given Hercules”—whose temple he had robbed—”more trouble than the <span class="italic">boar</span> of Erymanthus,” “it was a bad <span class="italic">priest</span> who left such a worthless <span class="italic">boar</span> behind” (Verres’ predecessor was Sacerdos, “priest”).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_91_51" id="target_note_LCL126_91_51"><sup>51</sup></a> Occasionally however a lucky chance provides an opportunity of making good use even of this trick: Cicero in <span class="italic">Pro Caecina</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_91_52" id="target_note_LCL126_91_52"><sup>52</sup></a> says of the witness Sextus Clodius Phormio “No less black and no less confident than Phormio in Terence.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_91_53" id="target_note_LCL126_91_53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
