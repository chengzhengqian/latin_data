<p>Chapter 3 deals with Rumours, a simple topic, not given much attention by rhetors: see however <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 2.12.</p>
<p>Torture, the theme of 5.4, is much more significant, since the extraction of evidence by torture from slaves was a feature of Athenian law, and so a <span class="italic">topos</span> with the orators. Discussions include <span class="italic">Rhetorica ad Alexandrum</span> 16, Aristotle, <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 1.15, 1376b31; <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 2.10, Cicero, <span class="italic">Partitiones oratoriae</span> 117, <span class="italic">Topica</span> 74. See also <span class="italic">Declamationes Minores</span> 269 (with Winterbottom’s notes), Bonner, <span class="italic">RD</span> 112. Cicero, <span class="italic">Pro Sulla</span> 78–79 develops the topic.</p>
<p>In discussing “documentation” (5.5), Quintilian is mainly concerned with forgery; Cicero’s <span class="italic">Pro Archia</span> (8–9) and <span class="italic">In Verrem</span> 2 (186–191) illustrate the use of this area of argument in various contexts.</p>
<p>Oaths (5.6) were more important, and still had considerable significance in Roman law, since an oath as to the justice of his case taken by one party at the invitation of the other before the praetor was regarded as determining the issue, and perjury, however common, was not condoned.</p>
<p>Finally, witnesses (5.7; Lausberg § 354). Quintilian’s treatment (predecessors include <span class="italic">Rhetorica ad Alexandrum</span> 15.1–3, <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 2.9–12) covers both the “commonplace” <span class="italic">de testibus</span>—i.e. the discussion of the value of witnesses in comparison with other forms of evidence, to be handled according to the needs of the case (1–7)—and also methods of Interrogation (8–37). There is a great deal of practical sense in this last part of the chapter, and Quintilian is able to draw on his own experience.</p>
<p>(B) Technical proofs will be seen to be of various kinds, Signs, Arguments, and Examples being the main ones.
