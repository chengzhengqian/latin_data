or a thousand, when the possibilities are infinite? It is the teacher’s business to demonstrate every day in one kind of case after another what is the order of topics and their connection, so that experience and the skill to transfer it to similar cases are gradually developed.

Yet, having once acquired the principles of imitation, he will reproduce whatever he is presented with. What potter has not made a vessel such as he never saw before?</p>

A doctor will teach what has to be done in each kind of illness, what is to be looked for and by what signs; but he will not communicate the power of feeling a pulse, or noting temperature, pattern of breathing, or difference of colour: these are a matter of the individual pupil’s natural ability. Let us therefore look for most of what we need from our own resources, take counsel with the Cause we are to plead, and realise that men discovered our art before they taught it. The most potent Disposition of the whole Cause—what is properly called its “economy”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_293_3" id="target_note_LCL126_293_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—is something which cannot be determined unless we imagine ourselves confronted by an actual situation. It consists in deciding when a Prooemium is needed and when not; when the Narrative should be continuous and when divided; when to begin at the beginning and when, like Homer,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_293_4" id="target_note_LCL126_293_4"><sup>4</sup></a> to start in the middle or at the end; when no statement of facts at all is required; when we should begin with our own, when with our opponents’ positions; when with
