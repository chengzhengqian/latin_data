<p>The following <span class="italic">controversia</span> is an example: “A tyrant, suspecting that his doctor had given him poison, tortured him, and, when he persisted in denying the charge, sent for a second doctor, who told him that he had been given poison, but that he himself would give him an antidote; he gave him a potion, after drinking which the tyrant died. The two doctors are in contention for the reward.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_201_26" id="target_note_LCL126_201_26"><sup>26</sup></a> Here, as in the cases where the parties seek to transfer guilt to one another, there is a comparison of the two claimants, based on character, motives, opportunities, times, means, and evidence.</p>
<p>A similar procedure applies in another type of case, even if it is not an <span class="italic">antikatēgoria,</span> in which the question is raised which of two acts has been committed, but without accusing anyone. Both parties make and maintain their own account of the events. Thus in the case of Urbinia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_201_27" id="target_note_LCL126_201_27"><sup>27</sup></a> the claimant alleges that Clusinius Figulus, Urbinia’s son, escaped after the defeat of the army in which he had fought, underwent various adventures, was even kept prisoner by the king, and finally returned to Italy and his home among the †Margini†<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_201_28a" id="target_note_LCL126_201_28a"><sup>28</sup></a> and was recognised there. Pollio, on the other hand, asserted that he had served two masters as a slave at Pisaurum, practised medicine, been manumitted, joined another slave household which was for sale, and was bought as a slave, at his own request, by Pollio. Does not this entire case consist of a Comparison between the two Causes, and of two very different Conjectures? (The principle governing claims and denials is the same as that governing prosecution and defence.)</p>
