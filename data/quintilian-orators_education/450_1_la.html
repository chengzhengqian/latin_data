apologizes for all this detail, which cannot of course be exhaustive; what is really important is the use made of jokes and the moderation shown in them.</p>
<p>Finally (102–112), Quintilian takes issue with Domitius Marsus on the meaning and scope of <span class="italic">urbanitas</span>; Marsus had given the word far too wide a range.</p>
<p>It has to be said that many of the jokes in this chapter are obscure, and Quintilian’s grouping of them under his various rhetorical categories can be puzzling.</p>
<p>“Altercation,” the subject of 6.4, is not a topic of the Greek rhetoricians. In Roman courts, this kind of debate followed the set speeches and examination of witnesses, and was sometimes left to junior or specialist advocates. A classic description of the altercation of Cicero and Clodius in the Senate, May 61 <span class="sc">bc</span>, is in Cicero, <span class="italic">Ad Atticum</span> 1.16.10. See in general Crook, <span class="italic">Advocacy,</span> 129, 184, and the papyrus examples, ibid. 76. This is therefore a practical chapter. After justifying his discussion of this subject under Invention, and drawing attention to its connection with the examination of witnesses (already handled in 5.7), Quintilian shows how vital it is in all cases which depend on nontechnical proofs (1–7). A quick, acute, but cool mind is needed (8–13). Prepare beforehand (14–16). Practice is useful (21).</p>
<p>Finally (6.5), “strategy” and “judgement.” Here again Quintilian is on ground not much covered by others—naturally enough, since this process of sifting and selecting the results of Invention comes with practice and experience, working on natural abilities rather than on any body of precept: so also Sulpicius Victor (320 Halm). Lausberg §§ 1153–1154.</p>
