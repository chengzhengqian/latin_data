Prooemium.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_231_21" id="target_note_LCL125_231_21"><sup>21</sup></a> Those who think it should cannot be thought to have no good reasons. For since the purpose of the Prooemium is to make the judge better disposed, more receptive, and more attentive in taking in the facts; and since the Proof cannot be produced unless the Cause is duly known, it seems that the judge ought to be provided with knowledge of the facts at the outset. But even this is sometimes altered by the circumstances of the Cause—unless, that is, you think that Cicero, in his magnificent published defence of Milo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_231_22a" id="target_note_LCL125_231_22a"><sup>22</sup></a> was wrong to delay his Narrative by placing three Questions before it, or that it would have been advantageous to explain how Clodius set an ambush for Milo (a) if it had been wrong in principle to defend a client who confessed to homicide, (b) if Milo had been condemned in advance by the senate’s judgement, or (c) if Pompey, who, as well as exerting influence in other ways, had blockaded the court with armed soldiers, was to be feared as Milo’s enemy. These three Questions therefore had also the force of a Prooemium, because they all helped to prepare the judge. Again, in the <span class="italic">Pro Vareno</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_231_23" id="target_note_LCL125_231_23"><sup>23</sup></a> Cicero postponed the Narrative till he had disposed of certain objections. This will be done with advantage whenever we have not only to rebut the charge but to shift it on to our opponents, so that, once this defence has been completed, the Narrative can form the beginning of the incrimination of the other person, just as in armed combat

In the extant speech, Cicero shows in the Prooemium that homicide may be justifiable in some circumstances (7–11), that the senate approved Milo’s action (12– 14), and that Pompeius allowed that it might be justified (15).
