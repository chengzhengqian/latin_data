<span class="label"><span class="italic">Atticists and Asianists</span></span>
<p>This distinction between “Attic” and “Asianic” orators was an ancient one. The former were held to be concise and sound, the latter inflated and hollow. In the former there was nothing superfluous, the latter were especially lacking in judgement and restraint. Some, including Santra,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_291_41" id="target_note_LCL494_291_41"><sup>41</sup></a> think that this happened because, as Greek gradually extended its range into the neighbouring cities of Asia, people who had not yet secured sufficient command of the language acquired a passion for eloquence, and so began to express by Periphrases what could have been said directly, and then continued in the same vein. I prefer to think that the stylistic difference is due to the character both of the orators and of their audiences. The polished and refined Athenians could not bear emptiness and redundance, while the Asiatics, who are in other respects a more bombastic and boastful race, were more vainglorious also in their oratory. Later, the critics who made this classification added a third style, the Rhodian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_291_42" id="target_note_LCL494_291_42"><sup>42</sup></a> conceived as coming between the other two and as a mixture of both. Such writers possess neither Attic conciseness nor Asianic abundance, but seem to have a style derived partly from their nation, partly from their founder. This was Aeschines,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_293_43" id="target_note_LCL494_293_43"><sup>43</sup></a>
