horse” (<span class="italic">hippos</span>) if you want to remember the name Chrysippus. Quintilian is clearly sceptical about the value of <span class="italic">memoria technica</span>, with its elaborate system of visual images, in comparison with practice and development of the natural memory; but he devotes a good deal of space to it all the same (17–26), before proceeding (27–50) to more practical considerations. He is also a valuable source for the history of the “art” (11–16). See in general Yates (1966) and H. Blum (1969). Lausberg §§ 1083–1090 gives a brief account.</p>
<p>In 11.3, Quintilian turns todelivery. Aristotle (<span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 3. 1404a13) observes that this is a matter of nature rather than of art, though Thrasymachus had written about it in discussing emotion. Theophrastus, Aristotle’s successor, did write on the subject (frs. 712–713 Fortenbaugh), and sodid Demetrius of Phalerum (frs. 162–169 Wehrli). Cicero treats it in <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 3.213–227 and <span class="italic">Orator</span> 55–60. There is a short Greek account in Cassius Longinus (<span class="italic">Ars rhetorica</span> 194–197 Spengel–Hammer), who stresses the deceptive power of <span class="italic">hypokrisis</span> (the Greek term for <span class="italic">actio</span>), the need to observe real emotions, and what can be learned from actors. There is a detailed commentary on part of our chapter in U. Maier-Eichhorn (1989), with interesting illustrations of the hand gestures. Some good illustrations, and also information about the acting gestures represented in medieval manuscripts of Terence, which somewhat resemble those described by Quintilian, may be found in G. S. Andrete, <span class="italic">Gestures and Acclamations in Ancient Rome</span> (Baltimore and London, 1999), esp. 34–73. See also E. Fantham in <span class="italic">Phoenix</span> 36 (1982) 243–263, and, in general, J. Bremmer and H. Roodenburg (1991), esp. ch. 2 (by F. Graf). An older (still classic) survey is in Sittl (1890).
