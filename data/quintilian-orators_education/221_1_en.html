the just, and the expedient under this head. It is said that all the other Issues also are included in these, because (a) Quantity can sometimes be referred to Conjecture—for example, “Is the sun bigger than the earth?”—and sometimes to Quality—“What amount of punishment or reward is appropriate for a certain person?” (b) Transference is concerned with Quality; (c) Definition is a part of Transference; (d) Conflict of Laws, (e) Inference (Syllogism), and (f) most cases of Letter and Spirit, all rely on Equity, though the last named may also involve Conjecture—what did the legislator in fact intend?—and (g) Ambiguity always has to be developed as Conjecture because, as it is clear that the words have two meanings, it is the intention alone which is in question.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Three-Issue Theories</span></span>
<p>Most writers offer us three General Issues. Cicero adopts these in the <span class="italic">Orator,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_71_40" id="target_note_LCL125_71_40"><sup>40</sup></a> and thinks they embrace everything which comes into dispute or contention.

I quote: “There are only a few things which give birth to all speeches: fact or not; right or wrong; good or bad.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_71_41" id="target_note_LCL125_71_41"><sup>41</sup></a> But as, when we are said to have done something rightly (<span class="italic">iure</span>), this does not only mean legally, but also justly, Antonius’ followers chose to distinguish these Issues more clearly, and therefore spoke of Conjectural, Legal, and Juridical Issues.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_71_42" id="target_note_LCL125_71_42"><sup>42</sup></a> Verginius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_71_43" id="target_note_LCL125_71_43"><sup>43</sup></a> concurs. They then created species of these, subordinating to the Legal Issue both Definition and other Issues
