<p>The masterpiece of emotional writing concerning Quintilian’s bereavements forms an appropriate preface to the book on “emotions.” Its appropriateness argues deliberate choice: we should not infer that the final crushing blow struck just as Quintilian got to this point in his work.</p>
<p>We are still pursuing the Parts of a Speech, and have come to the Epilogue (<span class="italic">peroratio</span>).

The function of the epilogue is both factual (as recapitulation) and emotional (involving amplification of the facts, and appeals to pity or indignation as the case may be). Lausberg §§ 431–442.</p>

His practical concerns then come to the fore; he tells us (1.32–35) about various tricks of the trade, discusses the place for emotion in private Causes (1.36), and has much to say (1.37–42) about
