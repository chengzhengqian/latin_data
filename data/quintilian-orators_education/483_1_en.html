her body,” he does not mean that there is nothing ridiculous in her body. So “salty” will denote what is “not insipid,” a sort of simple seasoning of speech, perceived by an unconscious judgement—by the palate as it were—which stimulates and saves a speech from becoming tedious. For, just as salt generously sprinkled over food, if not in excess, gives a pleasure all its own, so this “salt” of speech has a quality which gives us a thirst for listening. (4) I do not think either that <span class="italic">facetus</span> applies only to the ridiculous. If it did, Horace would not have said that the Muses had given Vergil the gift of <span class="italic">facetum</span> in poetry.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_73_11" id="target_note_LCL126_73_11"><sup>11</sup></a> I think it means rather a certain grace and polished elegance. Thus Cicero, in a letter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_73_12" id="target_note_LCL126_73_12"><sup>12</sup></a> reports Brutus as saying “Truly the feet are <span class="italic">faceti,</span> the feet of one walking too softly in his delicate way”; and this fits in with Horace’s use of <span class="italic">facetum</span> and <span class="italic">molle</span> of Vergil.

(6) <span class="italic">Dicacitas</span> doubtless comes from <span class="italic">dicere</span> (to speak), which is a common factor in all forms of wit, but it denotes more particularly remarks which attack people in a laughing way. This is why people say that Demosthenes was <span class="italic">urbanus</span> but not <span class="italic">dicax.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_73_14" id="target_note_LCL126_73_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
