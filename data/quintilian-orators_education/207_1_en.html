In this case, there is also as it were a hidden person, since the mention of the tyrant makes the Question a double one, and there is an implied consideration both of time and of quality; but it is still not properly speaking a “Cause.”</p>
<p>What I call “Indefinite Questions” are also called “general”; if this is right, “Definite” Questions should be “special.” But in every “special” Question, a “general” one is implicit, because it is prior. And perhaps in Causes also, any consideration of Quality which comes into question must be general. “Milo killed Clodius; he was justified in killing an ambusher.” Does not this raise the question whether there is a right to kill an ambusher? And take Conjectural cases: surely they involve general Questions like “is the crime caused by hatred, or by greed?” or “should one trust evidence given under torture?” or “are witnesses or arguments more to be believed?” As for Definitions, everything they contain will undoubtedly be of universal application.
