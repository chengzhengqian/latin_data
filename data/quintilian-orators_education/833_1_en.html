Lucan is ardent, passionate, particularly distinguished for his <span class="italic">sententiae,</span> and (if I may say what I think) more to be imitated by orators than by poets.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_301_114" id="target_note_LCL127_301_114"><sup>114</sup></a> I name these, because Germanicus Augustus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_301_115a" id="target_note_LCL127_301_115a"><sup>115</sup></a> has been diverted from the literary pursuits he had begun by his responsibility for the world, and the gods did not think it enough that he should merely be the greatest of poets. But what can be more sublime, more skilled, more perfect in every respect than the works which he retired to write as a young man, after handing the supreme power to others?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_301_116" id="target_note_LCL127_301_116"><sup>116</sup></a> Who could sing of wars better than he who wages them sowell? Whom would the goddesses who preside over literature listen to with closer attention? To whom would his patron deity, Minerva,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_301_117" id="target_note_LCL127_301_117"><sup>117</sup></a> more readily reveal her arts? Future ages will tell of this more fully; at present, this aspect of his glory is obscured by the brighter splendours of his other virtues. Yet, Caesar, you will forgive me, as a worshipper at the shrine of literature, if I refuse to pass this by, and insist on testifying at least that, as Vergil has it,</p>
