<p class="noindent">Pursuing his scheme of the Parts of a Speech, Quintilian now comes to Proofs <span class="italic">(pisteis),</span> the one invariably essential element in any Cause.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 states the basic division into “technical” (<span class="italic">entechnoi</span>) and “nontechnical” (<span class="italic">atechnoi</span>) <span class="italic">pisteis,</span> i.e. those which are based on the “art” of rhetoric and those (like the evidence of witnesses and documents) which come from outside sources, and are provided by the circumstances of the case. This division goes back to the early stages of Greek rhetoric; it is in <span class="italic">Rhetorica ad Alexandrum</span> (7, 14) and is well developed in Aristotle (<span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 1.2, 1.15). Though it appears only incidentally in <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> and <span class="italic">De inventione,</span> and perhaps did not play a major role in Hermagoras’ system, it is in general standard elementary teaching in the schools: Cicero, <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 2.116, <span class="italic">Topica</span> 8, 24; <span class="italic">Partitiones oratoriae</span> 5–6; Anon. Seg. 145; Apsines 4.1; Minucianus 340 Spengel–Hammer; and especially Julius Victor 403ff. Halm = 44ff. Giomini–Celentano, largely based on Quintilian. Lausberg § 350.</p>
<p>(A) Quintilian takes the nontechnical proofs first (5.2–7).</p>
<p>Chapter 2 discusses previous decisions, though without any clear reference to Roman legal procedures. See <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 2.19; Lausberg § 353.</p>
