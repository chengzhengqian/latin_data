<p>With the representation of the characters of others, which is called Ethopoeia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_69_107" id="target_note_LCL127_69_107"><sup>107</sup></a> or, as some prefer, Mimesis, we come to the gentler emotions, because this usually involves humour. It operates both with actions and with words. The form with actions is akin to Hypotyposis; the form with words is illustrated by this passage of Terence:</p>
<p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line indent1">Or did I not know your drift? “A little girl</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>There are other procedures too which give pleasure and serve greatly to attract sympathy, both by providing variety and also by their own nature; they make us less suspect to the judge by exhibiting a certain simple and spontaneous style. They include: (1) pretended repentance for what is said: thus in <span class="italic">Pro Caelio,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_69_110" id="target_note_LCL127_69_110"><sup>110</sup></a> “But why have I introduced such an authoritative character?” (compare also common remarks like “I slipped into this without realizing it”);<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_69_111" id="target_note_LCL127_69_111"><sup>111</sup></a> (2) pretended uncertainty about what to say: “What remains?” or “Have I left anything out?”; (3) pretended discovery of something on the spot; as in Cicero’s “I have
