<p>There are many types of humorous retorts, but the most attractive is that which is supported by some verbal likeness: an example is Trachalus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_105_84" id="target_note_LCL126_105_84"><sup>84</sup></a> answer to Suillius:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_105_85" id="target_note_LCL126_105_85"><sup>85</sup></a> Suillius says “If this is true, you go into exile”; Trachalus replies “If it is not true, you go back.”</p>
<p>Humorous evasion is illustrated by the answer given by Cassius Severus when someone reproached him with the fact that Proculeius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_105_86" id="target_note_LCL126_105_86"><sup>86</sup></a> had banned him from his house: “Do I ever go there?” he replied.

<p>The opposite to a denial is a pretended confession; this too can be very witty. Afer was once acting against a freedman of the emperor Claudius; another person of the same status, on the opposite side, called out “Besides, you are always speaking against the freedmen of Caesar”; “Yes, but I
