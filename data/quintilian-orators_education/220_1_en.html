“things” come Conjecture (he calls it <span class="italic">kat’ aisth</span>ē<span class="italic">sin,</span> “by perception”), Quality, Definition (which he calls <span class="italic">kat’ ennoian,</span> “by idea”), and Relation.</p>
<p>From this principle also comes the division into “written” and “unwritten” types of Issue.</p>
<p>Cornelius Celsus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_69_36" id="target_note_LCL125_69_36"><sup>36</sup></a> also gives us two General Issues: whether something exists, and what sort of thing it is. He subordinates Definition to the first of these, because one can ask equally well about the man who denies taking money from the temple and about the other man who admits taking private money from the temple, whether either of them is guilty of sacrilege.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_69_37" id="target_note_LCL125_69_37"><sup>37</sup></a> He divides Quality into Fact and Written Text. Under Written Text he put the four legal Issues<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_69_38" id="target_note_LCL125_69_38"><sup>38</sup></a> but not Transference: “Quantity” and “Intention” he put under Conjecture.</p>
<p>There is yet another theory of dividing Issues into two classes. This teaches that a dispute is either about Substance or about Quality, and that Quality is a matter either of Generality or of Incidentals.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_69_39" id="target_note_LCL125_69_39"><sup>39</sup></a> Substance is dealt with by Conjecture; for the Question is one of Fact—did it happen, is it happening, will it happen?—and sometimes also of Intention. (This is an improvement on the doctrine of those who call the Issue of Conjecture “Issue of Fact,” as though the Question related only to the past and only to the thing done.) Quality, in its most general form, rarely comes into court: “Is what is commonly praised necessarily honourable?” is an example. Quality of Incidentals refers either to an ambivalent term—“Is the man who stole the private funds from the temple guilty of sacrilege?”—or to a clearly named fact, where it is certain that the deed has been done, and there is no doubt about what it is that has been done. They put all questions concerning the honourable,
