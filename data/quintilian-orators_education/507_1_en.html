<p>If we accept these definitions, whatever is well said will also count as “urbanely” said. It was natural therefore that the propounder of this view should classify “urbane” sayings into “serious,” “humorous,” and “intermediate”; that division holds of all good sayings. However, it seems to me that even some jokes can be classed as not sufficiently “urbane.” This is because, to my thinking, Urbanity means something in which nothing that is incongruous, coarse, unpolished, or exotic can be detected in meaning, words, pronunciation, or gesture. Thus it resides not so much in individual words as in the whole tone of speech, just as for the Greeks “Atticism” conveys the whole flavour of Athens. However—so as not to suppress the learned Marsus’ opinion—let me say that he divides serious utterances into three classes, the honorific, the derogatory, and the neutral. Of the honorific, he gives as an example Cicero’s remark before Caesar in <span class="italic">Pro Ligario:</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_121_116" id="target_note_LCL126_121_116"><sup>116</sup></a> “You who never forget anything except injuries.” For the derogatory, he gives what Cicero wrote to Atticus about Pompey and Caesar:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_121_117" id="target_note_LCL126_121_117"><sup>117</sup></a> “I know whom to avoid, I don’t know whom to follow.” For the neutral (which he calls “apophthegmatic”), he quotes <span class="italic">In Catilinam,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_121_118" id="target_note_LCL126_121_118"><sup>118</sup></a> where Cicero says that “death can never be grievous to the brave, nor premature to a former consul, nor unhappy to a philosopher.” All these remarks are admirable; but I do not see why they should particularly be classed as Urbanity. If it is not the tone of the whole speech which deserves this name (as I believe), but it can be claimed for individual sayings, I should be inclined to use “urbane” of sayings which come
