the soul is immortal or only continues to exist for a time. Some call this the Minor Premiss, some the Reason.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_509_14" id="target_note_LCL125_509_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The Epicheireme is no way different from Syllogisms, except that they have more species and infer truth from truth, whereas the Epicheireme is most often used with Propositions which are merely probable. If doubtful Propositions could always be proved by means of admitted ones, there would hardly be any use for an orator in this type of Argument. How much talent do you need to say “The property belongs to me, for I am the only son of the deceased”; or “I am the only heir”—for by law the property of an intestate &lt;goes to the next of kin and that of a man who has made a will&gt; goes in accordance with the will—“so it belongs to me?” But when the Reason itself comes into question, we have to establish the certainty of the proposition we are going to use to prove what is uncertain. For example, if the Major Premiss were “You are not his son” or “You are not legitimate” or “You are not his only son,” or again “You are not his heir” or “It is not a valid will” or “You cannot inherit” or “You have co-heirs,” we have to establish the fact which makes it right for the property to be adjudged to us. When an unusually long Reason intervenes, the final Conclusion becomes essential. Otherwise, Major Premiss and Reason suffice: “Laws are silent in the midst of arms, and do not bid us wait for their approval, because the man who chooses to wait will have to pay an unjust penalty before the just penalty can be claimed.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_509_15" id="target_note_LCL125_509_15"><sup>15</sup></a> It has therefore been said that an Enthymeme based on Consequents resembles a Reason. However, (1) it is sometimes right to state individual Propositions (like the one just quoted:
