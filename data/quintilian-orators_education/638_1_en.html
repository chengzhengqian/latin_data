<p class="noindent">But it will be quite inappropriate for an orator to do the same and illustrate the obvious by the mysterious.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even the type of Simile which we discussed in connection with Arguments<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_383_93" id="target_note_LCL126_383_93"><sup>93</sup></a> can provide Ornament for a speech, and make it sublime, colourful, attractive, or striking. The more remote the source of the Simile, the more novelty it produces and the more unexpected it is. The following examples may seem too ordinary, and useful only for winning credibility: “The mind becomes better and richer by learning, as the soil does by cultivation”; “As doctors amputate limbs which disease has alienated from the body, so wicked and dangerous men, even if they are related to us by blood, must be cut off.” A higher level is reached by the passage in the <span class="italic">Pro Archia</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_383_94" id="target_note_LCL126_383_94"><sup>94</sup></a> “Rocks and deserts respond to the voice, savage beasts are often moved and brought to a stand by the power of song,” and so on. This type of Simile has been corrupted by some writers, mainly as a result of declamatory licence; the comparisons they use are false, and even so they fail to apply them to the subjects which they wish them to parallel. Both these faults are to be seen in examples which were on everybody’s lips when I was young: “The sources of great rivers are themselves navigable” and “A cutting from a choice tree bears fruit from the start.”</p>
<p>In any Comparison (<span class="italic">parabolē</span>), either the Simile comes first and the subject after, or the subject first and the Simile after. Sometimes the Simile is free and detached, sometimes (and this is much the best arrangement) it is connected with the object of which it is an image, with a correspondence between the two halves of the comparison; this effect is produced by what is called <span class="italic">antapodosis</span> or “repayment.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_383_95" id="target_note_LCL126_383_95"><sup>95</sup></a> The Simile I mentioned just now comes first:</p>
