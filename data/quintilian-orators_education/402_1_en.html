noblest man the best?” This will have to be admitted. This is a very powerful procedure in the examination of witnesses, but it takes a different form in a set speech, where the orator <span class="italic">either</span> answers himself (“Which is the noblest fruit? The best, I think. And the horse? The swiftest. So among men, the noblest is not the man who excels in distinction of birth, but the man who excels in virtue.”)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_433_4" id="target_note_LCL125_433_4"><sup>4</sup></a> &lt;<span class="italic">or</span>&gt; . . .</p>
<p>Now all Arguments of this kind must be either Similars or Dissimilars or Contraries. A Simile<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_433_5" id="target_note_LCL125_433_5"><sup>5</sup></a> is sometimes adopted also to embellish a speech; I shall deal with this when the time comes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_433_6" id="target_note_LCL125_433_6"><sup>6</sup></a> but for the moment shall discuss only Similes which are relevant to Proof. The most effective thing of this kind is what is properly called Example, that is to say the mention of an event which either took place or is treated as having taken place, in order to make your point convincing. We have then to consider whether it is similar as a whole or only in part, so that we can take either all its features into use or only the potentially useful ones. Similar: “Saturninus was rightly killed, as were the Gracchi.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_433_7" id="target_note_LCL125_433_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Dissimilar: “Brutus killed his sons when they were plotting treachery; Manlius punished his son’s valour with death.” Contrary: “Marcellus restored works of art to the Syracusans when they were the enemy; Verres took them from them though they were our allies.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_433_8" id="target_note_LCL125_433_8"><sup>8</sup></a> Confir­mation</p>
