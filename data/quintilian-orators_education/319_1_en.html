<p>Let us remember to confine our fictions to matters which cannot be checked by a witness. This means things derived (1) from our own thoughts, of which we possess unique knowledge, (2) from the dead (no one can deny them), (3) from someone who shares our interest (he will not deny them), or even (4) from our adversary (because his denial will not be believed). “Colours” based on dreams and superstitions have lost all authority because they are so easy to invent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_267_60" id="target_note_LCL125_267_60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>There is no point in using “colours” in the Narrative unless they are consistent throughout the speech, especially as the only proof of some things consists of persistent assertion. For example, the parasite who claims as his son the young man who has been three times disowned by the rich man, and three times declared innocent, will certainly have a “colour.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_267_61a" id="target_note_LCL125_267_61a"><sup>61</sup></a> He can say that he exposed the child because of his poverty, and took up the role of a parasite because he had a son in the rich man’s house; and that the innocent boy had been disowned three times because he was not the child of the man who sought to disown him.</p>
