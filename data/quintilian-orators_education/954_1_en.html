<p>throwing himself about in his usual style while his colleague Octavius sat beside him, bandaged and smothered in medicaments because of his illness, Sicinius said “Octavius, you can never be thankful enough to your colleague; if <span class="italic">he</span> hadn’t been here, the flies would have eaten you today.”</p>
<p>Moving the shoulders about is another fault. Demosthenes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_153_93" id="target_note_LCL494_153_93"><sup>93</sup></a> is said to have cured himself of this by standing to speak on a narrow platform, with a spear suspended above his shoulder, so that if in the heat of his speech he forgot to avoid this, he would be warned by a prick from the spear. Walking about while speaking is only justified if, in public Causes, in which there are many judges, we want to impress our arguments specially on certain individuals. Some speakers throw the toga back over the shoulder, having drawn the fold of it down to the hips with the right hand, and then walk about and chatter while gesturing with the left hand: this is intolerable. It is objectionable even to draw your left hand in when you reach out further with your right. And this reminds me not to forget to mention how very foolish it is, in the intervals for applause, to whisper into someone’s ear or joke with friends or turn to your clerks from time to time, so as to look as if you were giving instructions for a gratuity to be handed out.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_153_94" id="target_note_LCL494_153_94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p>It is quite proper to lean towards the judge when giving him the facts of the case, especially if what you are saying is in any way obscure. On the other hand, to lean over the advocate sitting on the opposite bench is insulting. Leaning back towards your friends and letting them support you in their arms is an affectation, unless you have good reason to be tired. The same goes for being openly prompted when something slips your mind, and for reading from a text. All
