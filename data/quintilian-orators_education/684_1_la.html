Like the theory of Tropes and Figures in general, the popularity of this distinction and of its underlying concept of “the unnatural” (παρὰ φύσιν) is probably due in the main to Caecilius of Caleacte. Later rhetoricians discuss it: e.g. Alexander Numeniu (3. 9–10 Spengel) and Phoebammon (3. 43–45 Spengel). See Lausberg §§ 600–602, and, for the historical development, R. Granatelli, <span class="italic">Rhetorica</span> 12 (1994) 383–425. The theory conspicuously neglects the fact that some Figures (e.g. Anaphora, Antithesis, Chiasmus) reflect the need of oral speech to articulate thoughts in a way readily understood by the hearer (see S.
