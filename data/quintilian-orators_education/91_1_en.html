sharpens the wits, and generates quickness of perception. But it is thought that the advantages come not (as with other arts) when it has been learned, but only during the learning process. This is an uneducated view. It is not without good reason that some great men have expended enormous effort on this science.</p>
<p>Geometry is divided into two parts, one dealing with Number, the other with Form. Knowledge of numbers is essential not only to the orator, but to anyone who has had even a basic education. It is indeed very frequently involved in actual cases. There the speaker is thought an ignoramus, I will not say if he hesitates in adding up, but if he contradicts his calculations by shaky and inappropriate movements with his fingers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_231_37a" id="target_note_LCL124_231_37a"><sup>37</sup></a> The theory of lines also frequently comes into actual cases (there are disputes about boundaries and measurements) but it has a more important relation to oratory than this. In the first place, order is a necessary element in geometry: is it not also in eloquence? Geometry proves subsequent propositions from preceding ones, the uncertain from the certain: do we not do the same in speaking? Again: does not the solution of the problems rest almost wholly on Syllogisms? This is why you find the majority of people thinking that it is closer to dialectic than to rhetoric. But even the orator will sometimes, if rarely, prove his point by dialectic, seeing that, if the subject demands it, he will use Syllogisms, and certainly the Enthymeme, which is a rhetorical Syllogism.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_231_38" id="target_note_LCL124_231_38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
