<p>So too I feel no hesitation in counting as Consequences those Arguments which are derived from mutually supportive facts (some make a separate class of these and call them Arguments “based on reciprocal relationship” and Cicero describes them as “coming under the same principle”):<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_407_76" id="target_note_LCL125_407_76"><sup>76</sup></a> “If it is honourable for the Rhodians to farm out their harbour dues, it is honourable for Hermocreon to contract for them,” or “What is honourable to learn is honourable to teach.” Compare also the fine sentence of Domitius Afer which, though not of the same formal structure, has the same effect: “I prosecuted, you condemned.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_407_77" id="target_note_LCL125_407_77"><sup>77</sup></a> An Argument which proves the same thing from an opposite position is also a reciprocal Consequence: for example, the man who says that the world was born means at the same time that it also decays, because the fact is that everything that is born decays.</p>
<p>(6) Very like these is the form of Argumentation by which effects are commonly inferred from what produces them, and vice versa; this is called “Argument from Causes.” These conclusions are sometimes necessary, sometimes generally true but not necessary. For instance, a body necessarily casts a shadow in the light, and the shadow, wherever it falls, indicates that there is a body there. Others, as I said, are not necessary, either as regards both halves of the Argument, or as regards one. For example: “The sun tans the skin; but a man who is tanned has not necessarily been tanned by the sun”; “A journey makes one dusty; but not every journey produces dust, and not everyone who is dusty has come from a journey.” Examples of necessary Arguments are: “If it is wisdom that makes a
