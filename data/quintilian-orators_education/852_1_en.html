she has set difficulties in the way of every noble work—she even made it a law of birth that bigger animals should stay longer within the mother’s womb.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_339_3" id="target_note_LCL127_339_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>There are two questions: how we should write, and what it is best to write. I shall now take these in order.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_339_4" id="target_note_LCL127_339_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

We have to conduct a review of our thoughts and words, and weigh them one by one. Composition should come next; we need to try out Rhythms in all possible ways, not allowing every word to take possession of the place in which it first suggests itself. To do this with due care, we shall repeatedly have to go over what we wrote last. Apart from the fact that better connections are made in this way between what has gone before and what follows, the warmth of our thought, which has cooled down in the time spent writing, recovers strength and gathers fresh impetus, as it were, from going over the ground again. We see this happen in jumping competitions, where the competitors start their attempt a long way back, and run up to the area in which the jump is to be made. In javelin-throwing, likewise, we draw back our arms, and when we are about to shoot an arrow, we pull the bow-string back.</p>

Of course, we love all our own productions when they are newly born; if we did not, they would not even be written down.
