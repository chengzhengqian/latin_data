<p>Again, Amplification may be derived from Consequences; in this case the violence with which the wine burst out was such as to make it a matter not of chance or choice but of necessity that he vomited in the least appropriate place, and to ensure that it was not just his recently consumed food (as sometimes happens) that was brought up, but that there was an overflow to come up the next day.</p>
<p>Antecedents may have the same effect. When Aeolus, responding to Juno’s request,</p>
