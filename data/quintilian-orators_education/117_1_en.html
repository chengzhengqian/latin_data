Both are faults, but the one which comes from deficiency is worse than the one which comes from abundance. In boys, a perfect style is neither to be demanded nor expected; but there is a better prospect in a fertile mind, ambitious effort, and a spirit that sometimes has too many bold ideas. I should never feel troubled by a certain amount of excess in a pupil of this age.
