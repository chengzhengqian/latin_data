improvise a lot. It is the way in which weightiness can be maintained, and the superficial verbal facility acquire some depth. Think of the way farmers prune away the topmost roots of the vine,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_387_15" id="target_note_LCL127_387_15"><sup>15</sup></a> which pull the plant towards the surface, to enable the lower roots to go deeper and get stronger. It may well be that if we do both these things with care and persistence, each will help the other: we shall speak more accurately because we write, and write more fluently because we speak. We must write, therefore, whenever we can; when we cannot, we must meditate; people who cannot do either still have an obligation to speak in such a way that the advocate does not seem to have been caught unawares nor the litigant to have been abandoned.</p>
<p>Pleaders who are often in court commonly write out the essentials, at least the introductory parts, cover the rest of what they do at home by mental preparation, and meet sudden contingencies by improvising. Cicero’s notebooks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_387_16" id="target_note_LCL127_387_16"><sup>16</sup></a> show that this is what he did. The notes of other orators are also in circulation, some discovered by chance, just as the orator had composed them before speaking, and others collected in book form, like those of the Causes pleaded by Servius Sulpicius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_387_17" id="target_note_LCL127_387_17"><sup>17</sup></a> three of whose speeches are extant. These last notes are so complete that they seem to me to have been composed by the orator himself for the benefit of posterity. Cicero’s notes, on the other hand, which were meant only for the occasion, were collected<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_387_18" id="target_note_LCL127_387_18"><sup>18</sup></a> by his freedman Tiro. I do not make this apology for them because I think poorly of them, but rather to make them seem more worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>In this connection, I certainly allow such brief notes and books as can be held in the hand and which we may
