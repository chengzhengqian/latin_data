(let us suppose) has spoken and perhaps been convincing; we need the judge’s opinion to be different, and it cannot be changed unless we make him receptive and attentive to what we are going to say. I agree of course that some points have to be minimized, disparaged, and almost held up to scorn in order to reduce the attention which the judge pays to our opponent. Cicero did this in the <span class="italic">Pro Ligario.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_199_31" id="target_note_LCL125_199_31"><sup>31</sup></a> For what was his point in all that irony except to make Caesar pay less attention to the case, thinking it was nothing new? And what was the object of the irony in the <span class="italic">Pro Caelio</span> except to make the affair seem less serious than was thought?</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Different types of Cause require different types of Prooemium</span></span>
<p>It is obvious, however, that the need for the various procedures I have set out varies with the Type of Cause. Now most authorities give five Types of Causes:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_199_32" id="target_note_LCL125_199_32"><sup>32</sup></a> Honourable, Mean, Doubtful or Ambivalent, Paradoxical, and Obscure (<span class="italic">endoxon, adoxon, amphidoxon, paradoxon, dysparakolouth</span>ē<span class="italic">ton</span>). It seems right to add a sixth—the “Scandalous”—which some include under “Mean” and others under “Paradoxical.” (By this last they mean anything that is contrary to common expectation.) In Ambivalent Causes it is our main duty to make the judge well disposed, in Obscure Causes receptive of information, and in Mean Causes attentive. Honourable Causes are in themselves sufficient to win a fair hearing; the Paradoxical and the Scandalous need palliatives.</p>
