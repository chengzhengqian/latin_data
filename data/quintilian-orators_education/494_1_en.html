<p>Still more ingenious is the shift from like to like, when we borrow for one object circumstances which normally belong to another. This may of course be called fiction. For example, when ivory models of towns were carried in Caesar’s triumph, and a few days later wooden models were carried in Fabius Maximus’, Chrysippus said that these were the boxes for Caesar’s towns.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_95_61" id="target_note_LCL126_95_61"><sup>61</sup></a> Similarly Pedo on the swordsman who was chasing the netman but failed to strike him: “He wants to catch him alive.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_95_62" id="target_note_LCL126_95_62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>Similitude may be combined with Ambiguity: for example, Lucius Galba said to the man who took no trouble to run for the ball: “You’re running like a Caesar’s candidate.” The Ambiguity is in “run,” the resemblance lies in the self-confidence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_95_63" id="target_note_LCL126_95_63"><sup>63</sup></a> These indications should suffice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the combination of various kinds of humorous points is very common, and the best combination is the one that has a large number of elements.</p>
<p>With Dissimilarities, the principle is the same. A Roman <span class="italic">eques</span> was drinking in the theatre, and Augustus sent him a message to say “If I want lunch, I go home.” “Of course,” said the <span class="italic">eques,</span> “you are not afraid of losing your place.”</p>
<p>Contraries produce several varieties. Augustus was giving
