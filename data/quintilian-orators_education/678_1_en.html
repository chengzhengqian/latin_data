has to be placed in its proper position, as in a structure of unshaped stones. We cannot cut or polish words to make them fit together better when juxtaposed; we have to take them as they are and choose places for them. Indeed, the only way of making our prose rhythmical is by an opportune change of order. This is why those first four words, in which Plato, in his finest work, says that he “went down to Piraeus,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_463_89a" id="target_note_LCL126_463_89a"><sup>89</sup></a> were found written on his tablets in many different orders: he wanted to try out which order would make each word most effective.</p>
