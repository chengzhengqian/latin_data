<span class="label"><span class="italic">Other “tools” of the orator; the importance of character</span></span>
<p class="noindent">These are the “tools” which I promised to explain,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_247_1" id="target_note_LCL494_247_1"><sup>1</sup></a> tools not of the art, as some have thought, but of the orator himself; these are the weapons he needs to have at hand, this is the knowledge with which he needs to be armed, in addition, of course, to a facility with words and Figures, an understanding of Invention, practice in Disposition, a good Memory, and charm of Delivery. But the most important of all these is that greatness of personality which fear cannot break, disapproval cannot dismay, and the authority of the audience has no power to inhibit more than proper respect for them requires. For although the vices opposed to these good qualities—over-confidence, rashness, rudeness, arrogance—are all to be detested, yet no art, no study, no progress even will be of any use without firmness, confidence, and courage. You might as well serve out arms to the cowardly and unwarlike. I say it with real reluctance (for it may be misunderstood), but even shyness—a vice, but an amiable one, and one that can easily produce virtues—is sometimes damaging,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_247_2" id="target_note_LCL494_247_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and has in many cases caused gifts of talent and learning never to come to light, but to moulder away in secret. However—in case some of my readers are not yet proficient in distinguishing the senses of particular words—let me make it clear that I am not criticizing modest behaviour, but shyness, which is a sort of fear inhibiting the mind from doing what it ought to do; this results in confusion, regret that one ever started, and sudden silence. And who can hesitate to count as a vice
