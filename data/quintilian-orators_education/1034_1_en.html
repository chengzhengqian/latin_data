points which you see are to his liking, and retreat smartly from those which are not well received. The actual form of words must be suited to giving him information as painlessly as possible. This advice should not cause surprise, seeing that some changes are also made to suit the characters of witnesses. It was a shrewd move by the man who had asked an uneducated witness if he knew Amphion, and was answered “No,” to repeat the name without the aspirate and shortening the second syllable: whereupon the witness knew him perfectly well!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_313_82" id="target_note_LCL494_313_82"><sup>82</sup></a> Such situations will mean that the spoken version will sometimes be different from the written, namely when it is impossible to speak in the way that you would have to write.</p>

Now incisiveness seems to be required for giving information, smoothness for conciliating, and force for rousing emotion.
