speak, and if we have put forward points which cannot be refuted, since to provoke a reply which puts the other side in a strong position is to prompt him rather than confute him.</p>
<p>Most of the Attic orators, and almost all philosophers who have left writings concerning the art of rhetoric, have held that this is the only form of Peroration. I imagine that the Attic orators thought this because, at Athens, appeals to the emotions were actually forbidden by public announcement.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_21_6" id="target_note_LCL126_21_6"><sup>6</sup></a> I am less surprised by the philosophers, in whose minds emotion is a vice, and it seems immoral for a judge to be distracted from the truth, and inappropriate for a good man to take advantage of vices. None the less, they will admit that emotional appeals are necessary if truth, justice, and the common good cannot be secured by other means. What everyone agrees is that a Recapitulation is often useful in other parts of the speech as well, if the Cause is a complex one and defended by a number of different Arguments; nor would anyone doubt that there are many Causes, if they are short and simple, in which no Recapitulation is needed anywhere.</p>
<p>This part of the Peroration is equally available to both prosecution and defence.</p>
<p>Both sides also use much the same emotional appeals, but they employ particular emotions with different degrees of frequency and emphasis: the prosecution has to stir up the judges, the defence has to make them sympathetic. Yet the prosecutor sometimes excites tears of pity for the victim whose wrongs he seeks to avenge, while the defendant sometimes complains vehemently of the injustice of the calumny or the conspiracy against him. It will therefore be most convenient to treat the two roles separately.
