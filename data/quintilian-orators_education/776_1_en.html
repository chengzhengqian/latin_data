Now although both are made up of feet, there are various differences between them. (1) In the first place, Rhythms depend on time spaces, Metres also on the order of these: the former seem thus to be a matter of Quantity, the latter 〈also〉 of Quality. (2) Rhythm is either (a) equal, like dactylic rhythm,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_187_40" id="target_note_LCL127_187_40"><sup>40</sup></a> one long syllable being equivalent to two shorts (other feet also have the same characteristic, but the name is valid for all; even schoolboys know that a long syllable occupies two “times,” and a short syllable one); or (b) in the proportion 3:2, as in the Paean, which consists of a long and three shorts or three shorts and a long, or any other pattern in which the relation of three “times” to two produces this proportion;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_187_41" id="target_note_LCL127_187_41"><sup>41</sup></a> or (c) in the proportion 2:1, like the Iambus (consisting of a short and a long) and its opposite.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_187_42" id="target_note_LCL127_187_42"><sup>42</sup></a> These are also metrical feet, but the difference is that, in
