the detail (he does however give an original discussion in <span class="italic">Elemente</span> (1963) §§ 46–90, and this part of Quintilian is extensively used in <span class="italic">Handbook</span> §§ 149–223).</p>
<p>7.1 gives general rules which apply to all Issues. One must know the Cause well and look at the problems from the opponent’s point of view also (1–8). Defence and prosecution have different requirements, which affect the order in which charges should be handled (9–12), while complex cases also raise problems of Disposition (13–22). In what follows (23–39), Quintilian refers a good deal to his own practice, both in declamation and in real cases, and concludes (40–64) with a complex example worked in great detail, which gives a good (and perhaps disconcerting) idea of how Quintilian taught declamation.</p>
<p>The Issues are now treated in turn. Conjecture (7.2) comes first. The chapter is very concise, and not at all easy to analyse. The basic distinctions on which the discussion is based are (1) between Conjecture of Fact and Conjecture of Intention; (2) between Conjectures relating to past, present, and future, the past being of course the most important because this is what legal cases are usually about; (3) between situations in which the act is denied, and those in which the act is admitted but said to be done by someone else. Quintilian deals at length (27–43) with the handling of character, motive, and intention. Once again (54) he is at pains to point out respects in which declamation practice is damaging if carried over into real situations. Compared with Cicero (<span class="italic">De inventione</span> 2.14–49), all this is quite detailed; compared, e.g., with Sulpicius Victor, it is unsystematic.</p>
<p>7.3 is on Definition (see Cicero, <span class="italic">De inventione</span> 2.52–56; Sulpicius Victor 336–338 Halm, Julius Victor 388–389
