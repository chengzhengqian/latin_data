how much better it is to absorb the best models, and how hard it is at a later stage to eradicate faults which have once become ingrained, because this puts a double burden on the teachers who take over, namely that of un-teaching, which is a heavier task than teaching, and has to be given priority. It is for this reason that the famous piper Timotheus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_277_1" id="target_note_LCL124_277_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is said to have charged those who had had another teacher double the fee he asked of complete beginners.</p>
