not however commend this accomplishment in itself (it has no practical use and there is no need for it) so much as mention it as a useful example with which to encourage future advocates in their ambition to improvise.</p>
<p>However, confidence in facility should never be so great that we fail to spend at least a short time (which we shall hardly ever fail to have) in considering what we are going to say. In the courts and the forum this is always possible, because no one pleads a Cause in which he has not been instructed. Some declaimers, it is true, are induced by perverse ambition to be willing to speak as soon as the theme has been given out;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_383_10" id="target_note_LCL127_383_10"><sup>10</sup></a> indeed—a particularly frivolous and theatrical trick—they even ask for a word with which to start. But Eloquence gets her own back by deriding people who insult her like this, and those who want to seem learned to the foolish seem fools to the learned. If chance does compel us to plead at such short notice, we shall need a peculiarly agile mind, and all its force will have to be directed to the facts of the case, at the cost of some temporary sacrifice of concern for the words, if we find it impossible to manage both aspects. On such occasions, a slower delivery and a hesitant and ostensibly indecisive manner give us time; but we must seem to be thinking things out, not to be lost for words. This will serve anyway while we are still clearing harbour, if the wind drives us on before our tackle is in place; later, as we proceed, we shall gradually set the sails, get the ropes in order, and pray for a wind to fill our canvas. Better this than surrender to a meaningless torrent of words, and be carried by the storm, as it were, wherever it chooses to blow us!</p>
<p>This facility however needs just as much study to maintain
