find it useful to speak of his past life, and the reasons for which he has fallen foul of the whole province or of his accuser or of a witness? If this is not a Narrative, then neither is the first Narrative in Cicero’s <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_227_14" id="target_note_LCL125_227_14"><sup>14</sup></a> beginning “Aulus Cluentius Habitus . . .” For he says nothing there about the poisoning, but speaks only of the reasons why Cluentius’ mother is hostile to him.</p>
<p>Other Narratives, not belonging to the Cause itself but relevant to it, are (a) Narratives told as examples, for instance, in the speech against Verres, the story of Lucius Domitius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_227_15" id="target_note_LCL125_227_15"><sup>15</sup></a> who crucified a shepherd because he confessed that the boar which he had brought as a present to Domitius had been killed with a hunting spear; (b) Narratives intended to dispel some charge irrelevant to the case: for example, in the <span class="italic">Pro Rabirio Postumo</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_227_16" id="target_note_LCL125_227_16"><sup>16</sup></a> “On arrival at Alexandria, members of the jury, the only means of saving his money which the king proposed to Postumus was that he should undertake the control and stewardship, as it were, of royal property”; (c) Narratives intended for Amplification, like the description of Verres’ journey.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_227_17" id="target_note_LCL125_227_17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>A fictitious Narrative is sometimes introduced, either (a) to arouse the emotions of the judges, as in the passage of <span class="italic">Pro Roscio</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_227_18" id="target_note_LCL125_227_18"><sup>18</sup></a> about Chrysogonus which I mentioned above, or (b) to relax them with a little humour, as in the passage about the brothers Caepasius in <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_227_19" id="target_note_LCL125_227_19"><sup>19</sup></a> or sometimes (c) as a digression for ornament, like the passage about Proserpina, also in the Verrines: “Once upon a time, in this place, a mother is said to have searched for her daughter . . .”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_227_20" id="target_note_LCL125_227_20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
