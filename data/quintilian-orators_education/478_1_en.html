<p>Again, when pity is needed, let us believe that the ills of which we are to complain have happened to us, and persuade our hearts of this. Let us identify with the persons of whose grievous, undeserved, and lamentable misfortunes we complain; let us not plead the case as though it were someone else’s, but take the pain of it on ourselves for the moment. We shall thus say what we would have said in similar circumstances of our own. I have frequently seen tragic and comic actors, having taken off their masks at the end of some emotional scene, leave the stage still in tears.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_63_17" id="target_note_LCL126_63_17"><sup>17</sup></a> And if the mere delivery of the written words of another can so kindle them with imagined emotions, what shall <span class="italic">we</span> be capable of doing, we who have to imagine the facts in such a way that we can feel vicariously the emotions of our endangered clients?</p>
<p>Even in school, it is proper that the student should be moved by his subject and imagine it to be real—all the more indeed because we speak in school more often as litigants than as advocates. We play the part of an orphan, a shipwrecked man, or someone in jeopardy: what is the point of taking on these roles if we do not also assume the emotions?</p>
