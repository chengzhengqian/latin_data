<p>Theophrastus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_267_25" id="target_note_LCL127_267_25"><sup>25</sup></a> says that reading the poets is very useful for the orator, and many adopt his view, and not without good reason. From the poets we can get inspiration in thought, sublimity in language, every kind of emotional effect, and appropriateness in character-drawing; above all, minds jaded by the daily wear and tear of the courts are excellently refreshed by the delightfulness of such things. Cicero therefore thinks that this is the reading for our hours of rest.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_267_26" id="target_note_LCL127_267_26"><sup>26</sup></a> But let us remember that the orator should not follow the poet in everything—neither in his freedom of vocabulary, nor in his licence to develop Figures—and that poetry is designed for display.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_267_27" id="target_note_LCL127_267_27"><sup>27</sup></a> Quite apart from the fact that it aims exclusively for pleasure and pursues this by inventing things that are not only untrue but also unbelievable, it also has a special defence for its licence, namely that it is bound by metrical constraints and so cannot always use the literal expressions, but is driven by necessity off the straight path and into certain byways of language; it is obliged, therefore, not only to change words but to extend, shorten, transpose, and divide them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_267_28a" id="target_note_LCL127_267_28a"><sup>28</sup></a> But we, let us not forget, stand armed in the front line, fight for high stakes, and strive for victory. And I should not wish our weapons to be foul with neglect and rust; they should have the brilliance that strikes terror, the brilliance of steel that dazzles both mind and eye, not that of gold and silver, which is unwarlike and more dangerous to its possessor than to the foe.</p>
