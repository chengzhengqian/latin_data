<p>or cheapen the prestige of such a beneficial service, because most things seem to be cheapened just by having a price set on them. This is plain enough to a blind man, as they say,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_261_12" id="target_note_LCL494_261_12"><sup>12</sup></a> and no one who has a sufficiency (and I mean a quite modest amount) can make this a source of income without being thought shabby.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a manâ€™s domestic means require supplementing for some necessary purpose, he will only be following the precedent of all the philosophers if he allows himself to be rewarded: money was collected to support Socrates,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_261_13" id="target_note_LCL494_261_13"><sup>13</sup></a> and Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_261_14" id="target_note_LCL494_261_14"><sup>14</sup></a> took fees from pupils. Indeed I see no more proper way of making money than by accepting payment for an honourable duty from persons you have served well and who would not have deserved to be defended if they gave nothing in return. Indeed, this is not only just but necessary, because the work itself, and all the time spent on the affairs of others, curtails the opportunity for making money in other ways. But even so, there are limits to be observed. The most important point is: from whom do we accept money, how much, and for how long? The truly piratical practice of bargaining, and the abominable deals which involve putting a price on risk, are things with which even persons whose standards of honesty are low should have nothing to do, especially as an advocate who defends good men and good Causes has no reason to fear an ungrateful client. And suppose he does turn out ungrateful: I still prefer that it should be he who is in the wrong!</p>
