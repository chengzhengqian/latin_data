all things have been given names of their own? Finally, they argue that the speech of all the oldest orators was the closest to Nature, but that later speakers arose who were more like poets, and—though more cautiously—regarded invented or metaphorical words as a positive virtue.</p>
<p>There is some truth in this argument, and we should therefore take care not to depart as far as some people do from literal and normal usage.

Ordinary speech, it seems to me, has a different nature from the formal language of the man of eloquence. If all the latter had to do was to indicate facts, he would not make an effort to go beyond the correct uses of words; but as his duty is to please and to move and to induce various feelings in his hearers, he will also use those additional aids which we also owe to Nature. It is quite natural, after all, to use exercise to harden your arms, increase your strength, and improve your complexion. This is why, in every nation, some are thought more eloquent and more attractive speakers than others—if this were not so, everyone would be equal!—and why the same people speak in different ways about different things, and observe distinctions between persons.
