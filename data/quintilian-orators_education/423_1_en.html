<p>which have cumulative force should be taken separately, as in the example I quoted just above:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_475_9" id="target_note_LCL125_475_9"><sup>9</sup></a> “You were the heir, you were poor, your creditors had large claims on you, you had offended the testator, and you knew he was going to change his will.” Taken together, those Arguments are impressive; if you refute them one at a time, the flame which gathered strength from the mass will die down as its fuel is scattered—just as even very great rivers can be made fordable anywhere if they are &lt;diverted&gt; into a number of channels. The Proposition also should be adapted to these practical considerations, sometimes setting out points individually, sometimes embracing the whole complex, as it is sometimes enough to set out in one Proposition what your opponent has constructed out of a number of points. For example, if the accuser says that the defendant had several motives for doing what he alleges, we should deny the whole idea at once, without listing the individual motives, on the general ground that a man who had a motive for committing a crime has not necessarily done so. More often, however, it will be expedient for the prosecution to mass Arguments together, and for the defence to break them up.</p>
<p>A further point to consider is how the opponent’s statements should be refuted. (1) If they are patently false, a denial is enough; as when Cicero in <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_475_10" id="target_note_LCL125_475_10"><sup>10</sup></a> denies that the man whom the accuser says fell down dead after drinking the cup died on the same day. (2) Patently contradictory, superfluous, or foolish statements need no skill to rebut, and there is therefore no need to give principles or examples to illustrate these. (3) An “obscure” charge (as it is called), in which something is alleged to have been done secretly, and there is no witness or Argument, is suf­ficiently
