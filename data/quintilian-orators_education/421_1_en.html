case transferred. In a forensic case, there is virtually no other alternative. Pleas for mercy which are without any pretence of justification are very rare, and are made only before judges who are not limited to a stated form of verdict.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_471_3" id="target_note_LCL125_471_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Even the speeches given before Caesar and the triumvirs on behalf of members of the opposite party, though they do contain pleas, also adduce defences—unless, that is, we are to say that there is no robust defensive element in “What other object had we, Tubero, but to win the power that this man now has?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_471_4" id="target_note_LCL125_471_4"><sup>4</sup></a> But let us suppose we have one day to say, before the emperor or some other person who has power to decide whichever way he wishes, that the man for whom we are speaking does indeed deserve death, but that it is right for a merciful judge to spare even a man like this. In that case, first, we shall not now be dealing with an opponent but with the judge; secondly, we shall be adopting the form of a deliberative rather than a forensic subject, for we shall be persuading him to seek a reputation for humanity rather than the pleasure of revenge. With judges who are bound to pronounce sentence according to law, it is of course absurd to offer advice about the treatment of admitted guilt.</p>
<p>So a case which can neither be denied nor transferred must inevitably be defended, whatever its nature, or else one must give up the Cause. I have shown that there are two forms of denial: either “it was not done” or “what was done is not this.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_471_5" id="target_note_LCL125_471_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Cases which cannot be defended or transferred must inevitably be denied, and not only if a Definition might possibly help us, but also if there is no option except a bare denial. If there are witnesses, much can be said to discredit them. If there is a handwritten document, we can discuss the similarity of the letter forms.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_471_6" id="target_note_LCL125_471_6"><sup>6</sup></a> In
