cannot be justice. [Thus we must proceed from the Genus to the lowest Species: “Man is animal” is not enough, for this is the Genus. “Mortal,” though a species, is a definition common to other animals; if you add “rational,” nothing further remains to show what it is that you mean.]<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_395_54" id="target_note_LCL125_395_54"><sup>54</sup></a> (2) Species, on the other hand, offers a secure Proof of Genus, but a weak Refutation. For what is justice must certainly be a virtue; and what is not justice may still be a virtue, if it is courage, constancy, or self-control. Thus Genus will never be eliminated by Species, unless all the Species belonging to the Genus are eliminated; for instance “That which is neither immortal nor mortal is not an animal.”</p>
<p>(3) Properties and Differentiae are the next point. A Definition is confirmed by Properties, destroyed by Differentiae. A Property is either (a) that which belongs to one object alone (as speech or laughter to man) or (b) that which necessarily belongs to something, but not to this alone (as heat to fire). The same thing may have several Properties, as fire itself has those of light and heat. Consequently, the absence of any Property will destroy a Definition; but its presence, whatever it is, will not necessarily confirm it. Property is a very frequent subject of inquiry. Suppose it was said, on the ground of the Etymology, that it is the Property of a tyrannicide to kill a tyrant. We should deny this: an executioner is not said to be a tyrannicide, if the tyrant is handed over to him to be put to death; nor is one who kills a tyrant unwittingly or unwillingly.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_395_55" id="target_note_LCL125_395_55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>What is not a Property will be a Differentia. To be a slave and to be in servitude are different: hence the com­mon
