(1) The other side’s words can be chided, refuted, disparaged, turned back on them, or sidestepped. (2) Our own position can be indicated in a humorous way, and, as Cicero puts it, we can say things that are “subabsurd,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_75_17" id="target_note_LCL126_75_17"><sup>17</sup></a> for some remarks which are foolish if made inadvertently appear charming if they are a deliberate pretence. (3) The third category, as Cicero also says,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_75_18" id="target_note_LCL126_75_18"><sup>18</sup></a> consists in deceiving expectations, taking words in a perverse sense, and other procedures which do not affect either party, and so are called by me “neutral.”</p>

<p>(1) With reference to an action, laughter is aroused sometimes (a) by including an element of seriousness; when Marcus Caelius was praetor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_75_19" id="target_note_LCL126_75_19"><sup>19</sup></a> the consul Isauricus broke his curule chair; Caelius had another one put in its place, strung with leather straps (the consul was said to have been flogged at one time by his father); and sometimes (b) without any regard to modesty, as in the matter of Caelius’ box,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_75_20" id="target_note_LCL126_75_20"><sup>20</sup></a> which is quite unsuitable for an orator or indeed any serious man. The same may be said about ridiculous expressions or gestures, which do indeed have their attraction, but this is greater when they do not seem to be
