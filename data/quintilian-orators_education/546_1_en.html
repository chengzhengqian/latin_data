<span class="italic">Pro Vareno</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_199_22" id="target_note_LCL126_199_22"><sup>22</sup></a> compares individual arguments on the first charge, for the former . . . it would be rash to compare a stranger’s position with that of a mother. It is best therefore, if possible, for individual Arguments to be refuted individually; but if the separate parts cause us problems, we must fight on the whole front at once. And [if they accuse each other, or] if the defendant passes the guilt on to the adversary without actually accusing him (as Roscius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_199_23" id="target_note_LCL126_199_23"><sup>23</sup></a> does to his accusers, though he had not put them on trial) or again if the responsibility is laid on those whom we allege to have died by their own hand, the Arguments of the two sides are compared exactly as they are in cases of mutual accusation. This last mentioned type of case is not only often handled in the schools, but also in the courts. The sole question in the case of Naevius Arpinianus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_199_24" id="target_note_LCL126_199_24"><sup>24</sup></a> was whether his wife was thrown to her death by him or threw herself down of her own accord. (My speech in this Cause is the only one I have so far published, and I admit that I was induced to do so by a youthful desire for fame. The other speeches circulating under my name, corrupted as they are by the negligence of the shorthand-writers who took them down to make money, have very little of me in them.)</p>
<p>There is another type of “double Conjecture,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_199_25" id="target_note_LCL126_199_25"><sup>25</sup></a> quite different from this <span class="italic">antikatēgoria.</span> It is concerned with Rewards.</p>
