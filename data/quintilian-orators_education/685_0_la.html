concept which makes every possible emotional attitude correspond to a different Figure. He proceeds (26–45) to quote Cicero at length (<span class="italic">De oratore</span> 3.201–208, <span class="italic">Orator</span> 134–139) and regards his own subsequent discussion as more or less a commentary on the master’s (often obscure) text. This procedure (unique in Quintilian) recalls that of many later ancient and medieval rhetoricians for whom commentary on <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> or <span class="italic">De inventione,</span> or the works of Hermogenes, became an art form. We do not of course know whether Quintilian used this method in school.</p>
<p>Comparative material may be found in the texts mentioned in connection with Tropes (Book Eight), and also in Rutilius Lupus, whose work, which Quintilian cites, was based on that of Gorgias, the Athenian rhetor who taught Cicero’s son. Another source of parallel material, often valuable, is “Longinus” 17–29.</p>
<p>Figures of Thought come first, as in <span class="italic">De oratore.</span></p>
<p>In 9.2.1–5, Quintilian introduces the subject by pointing out how all rhetorical effects, though not in themselves Figures, allow or require Figures for their enhancement. Take Questions, for example (6–16; Lausberg §§ 767–770). They may of course be genuine inquiries, but often they are Figures employed to lend emotive force to the context. In this connection, Quintilian deals with a further set of devices, which he groups together as <span class="italic">praesumptio</span> (16–18; Lausberg § 785) and which consist of comments on the speaker’s own approach to his theme, or anticipations of his opponent’s. Their main object is to add credibility, and this is also true of pretended doubt (<span class="italic">dubitatio,</span> 19–20; Lausberg §§ 776–779) and the devices which take the form of consulting the adversary or the judge (<span class="italic">communicatio,</span>
