are the self-generated product of the happy richness of his immortal genius.

Who can give information more precisely, or stir feelings more deeply? Who had ever such a gift of charm? You believe him to be winning by consent what he is really extorting by force; and when he sweeps the judge along with his violence, the judge feels not that he is being hijacked, but that he is going along of his own accord. Indeed such is the authority in everything Cicero says that one is ashamed to disagree. Instead of the partisanship of an advocate, he displays the trustworthiness of a witness or a judge. And all the time these excellences, any one of which could hardly be attained by an ordinary person, however much he concentrated his effort, flow from Cicero without strain, and his oratory, than which nothing more beautiful has ever been heard, nevertheless displays all the marks of felicitous ease. It was not without reason that his contemporaries said he was “king” of the courts, and that for posterity Cicero has become not so much the name of a man as a synonym for eloquence itself. Let us fix our eyes on him, let him be the model we set before ourselves; if a student comes to love Cicero, let him assure himself that he has made progress.</p>
