<p>and cubs, kids and mother goats,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_449_40" id="target_note_LCL125_449_40"><sup>40</sup></a> which differ only in age. They also subdivide Contraries into pairs of things which are Opposite (night and day), Mutually Damaging (cold water and fever), Contradictory (truth and falsehood), or Disparate (hard and not hard). But I fail to see that this has any great relevance to our present subject.</p>
<p>It is more important to note that Arguments may be based (1) on Similarities in law: Cicero in the <span class="italic">Topics</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_449_41" id="target_note_LCL125_449_41"><sup>41</sup></a> “a man to whom the usufruct of a house has been left will not restore it for his heir, if it falls down, because he would not replace a slave if one died”; (2) on Contraries in law: “there is no bar to a legal marriage between parties who cohabit by consent, even if no contract has been signed, for signing a contract will have no value if it is agreed that there was no consent to the marriage”; (3) on Dissimilarities of law: Cicero in <span class="italic">Pro Caecina</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_449_42" id="target_note_LCL125_449_42"><sup>42</sup></a> “If anyone had forced me out of my house by armed violence, I should have ground for an action; so should I have none if he had prevented me from entering it?” (4) Dissimilarities may be exposed in the following way: “If a man who has bequeathed all his silver can be thought to have included also the silver coin, it does not follow that he is believed to have wished what is owed to him also to be paid to the legatee.”</p>
<p>Some have drawn a distinction between Analogy and Similarity, but I regard Analogy as a species of the genus Similarity. “As one is to ten, so is ten to a hundred” certainly involves Similarity, as does “a bad citizen is just like an enemy.” But these things often go too far: “If a liaison with a male slave is disgraceful for the mistress, so is a liaison with a slave girl for the master,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_449_43" id="target_note_LCL125_449_43"><sup>43</sup></a> or “If pleasure is the highest aim for dumb animals, so it is for man.” These arguments are very easily met by Arguments from Dissimi­lars
