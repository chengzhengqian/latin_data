idea of inquiring into truth; he is swept along by the tide, as it were, and yields to the swift current. Thus it is only the final verdict that reveals how effective the Arguments and witnesses have been; but the judge confesses the impact made by the orator on his emotions while he is still sitting in court and listening. When the tears, which are the aim of most perorations, start from his eyes, is not the decision given for all to see? So let the orator concentrate on this, “this is the task, this the toil”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_49_2" id="target_note_LCL126_49_2"><sup>2</sup></a> without this everything else is bare, thin, weak, and charmless.
