rudeness to pass for frankness, rashness for courage, and extravagance for abundance. Now the unskilled speaker is more openly and more frequently rude, even endangering his clients, and often also himself. But this itself earns good opinions, because people are only too pleased to listen to what they would not have been prepared to say themselves. The unskilled speaker is also less able to avoid the other danger, which is actually a matter of style: he makes desperate efforts, and hence, just because he is always looking for too much, sometimes succeeds in finding something impressive. But this is a rare piece of luck, and it does not compensate for his other faults.</p>
<p>Another reason why the untrained sometimes seem to have greater resources of language is that they say everything, whereas the trained speaker shows selection and restraint. The untrained also exempt themselves from the trouble of explaining their position. They thus avoid the chilly reception that our decadent courts give to Questions and Proofs, and seek only for effects which charm the ears of the audience, even if the pleasure is a perverse one.
