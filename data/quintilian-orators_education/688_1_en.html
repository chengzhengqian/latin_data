<h3><span class="italic">The difference between Figures and Tropes</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The last book having dealt with Tropes, there now follows the topic of Figures (<span class="italic">schēmata</span> as they are called in Greek), which is naturally connected with the preceding. Many in fact have held that Figures are Tropes; indeed, whether Tropes derive their name from being formed in a certain <span class="italic">way</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_11_1" id="target_note_LCL127_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or from their making <span class="italic">changes</span> in speech (hence their alternative name “Moves”),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_11_2" id="target_note_LCL127_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a> it has to be admitted that both these features are seen also in Figures. They have the same use too, for they both add force to the subject and provide charm.</p>
<p>There are some too who call Tropes Figures, among them Cartorius Proculus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_11_3" id="target_note_LCL127_11_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Indeed, the resemblance is so patent that it is not an easy matter to make a distinction between them. On the one hand, some species of them are clearly different, while retaining their generic likeness,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_11_4" id="target_note_LCL127_11_4"><sup>4</sup></a> inasmuch as both involve a rhetorically effective departure</p>
