lines just about Roman orators, yet without saying anything of his contemporaries, those at least who were alive at the time, except for Caesar and Marcellus;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_273_38" id="target_note_LCL127_273_38"><sup>38</sup></a> where will be the limit, then, if I 〈try toinclude〉 these and their successors, all the Greeks, and the philosophers, 〈poets, and historians〉? Safest is the brief advice given by Livy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_273_39" id="target_note_LCL127_273_39"><sup>39</sup></a> in his letter to his son, to read Demosthenes and Cicero, and then others as they are most like Demosthenes and Cicero. All the same, I must not conceal the main thrust of my own judgement. I believe that there will be found to be few, or rather hardly any, of those who have stood the test of time, who will not be of <span class="italic">some</span> use to any one who uses his judgement. Even Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_273_40" id="target_note_LCL127_273_40"><sup>40</sup></a> admits that he was greatly helped even by the very earliest writers, who had great talents but lacked art. I have much the same view about the moderns. How many of them can you find crazy enough not to have had some small hopes of being remembered by posterity on the basis of at least some aspect of their work? If there is any such, he will be found out within the first few lines, and so will release us before our experiment with him has wasted too much of our time. However, not everything that bears on some department of knowledge is necessarily also relevant to the formation of style (<span class="italic">phrasis</span>), which is our present subject.</p>
<p>Before I speak of individuals, I must make a few general points about the variety of opinions. Some think that only the ancients should be read and that there is no natural eloquence or truly masculine strength to be found elsewhere. Others find their pleasure in the wanton affectations
