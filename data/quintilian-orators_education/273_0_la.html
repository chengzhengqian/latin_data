<p>Chapter 2 proceeds to Narrative, and Quintilian’s treatment here too follows conventional lines, but with a strong practical bias. He discusses when a Narrative is essential and when not (4.2.4–23), and where it should be placed (4.2.24–30). Next come the traditional “virtues of Narrative”: Lucidity (36–39), Brevity (40–51), Credibility (52–60), to which some additional qualities (Grandeur, Vividness) are added (61–65). Various other topics follow: difficult cases, where the facts could tell against the client (66–82); whether chronological order should always be followed (83–87); false narratives (88–94); “colours” (i.e. “spin”) in narrative (94–102). The rest of the chapter is a rather scrappy collection of further precepts, with an emphasis on the importance of Figures and emotion (116–124), and some remarks on Second Narratives (128) and how to begin and end the Narrative (129–132).</p>

<p>Chapters 3 (Digression), 4 (Proposition, πρόθεσις), and 5 (Partition) deal with elements in the speech which are less clearly defined. “Digression” (Lausberg §§ 340–342; Anonymus Seguierianus 62; see also M. Heath, <span class="italic">Unity in Greek Poetics</span>
