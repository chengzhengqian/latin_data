<span class="label"><span class="italic">Enthymeme and Epicheireme, and how to refute them</span></span>
<p>The term Enthymeme is applied both to the Argument itself, that is to say the thing adduced to prove something else, and to the expression of the Argument. This, as I said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_501_1" id="target_note_LCL125_501_1"><sup>1</sup></a> takes two forms: (1) From Consequents: this form has a Proposition and, attached immediately to it, a Proof, as in <span class="italic">Pro Ligario</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_501_2" id="target_note_LCL125_501_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “At that time, the cause was in doubt, because there was something which could be proved on both sides; now, we have to judge that the cause which even the gods supported was the better.” Here we have a Reason and a Proposition, but no completed argument.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_501_3" id="target_note_LCL125_501_3"><sup>3</sup></a> It is thus an imperfect Syllogism. (2) From incompatibles: this is a much stronger Proof, and some restrict the name Enthymeme to this form.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_501_4" id="target_note_LCL125_501_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Thus Cicero in <span class="italic">Pro Milone</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_501_5" id="target_note_LCL125_501_5"><sup>5</sup></a> “So you are sitting here to avenge the death of a man whose life you would not wish restored, if you thought it in your power to restore it.” This form is sometimes multiplied, as by Cicero in the same defence:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_501_6" id="target_note_LCL125_501_6"><sup>6</sup></a> “So did he choose, at a time when it would cause some to complain, to kill the very man whom he refused to kill at a time when everyone would have been pleased? Did he, unhesitatingly, wrongfully, at an unfavourable place and time, and at risk to his own life, kill the very man whom he did not dare to attack lawfully, at a good place and time, and in perfect safety?”</p>
