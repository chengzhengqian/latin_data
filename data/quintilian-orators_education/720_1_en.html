<p>(1) The first of these uses is common in the schools. Here there are fictions involving conditions laid down by abdicating tyrants,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_75_121a" id="target_note_LCL127_75_121a"><sup>121</sup></a> or decrees of the senate following a civil war; it is made a capital offence to upbraid a defendant with his past, so that what is inexpedient in court is actually forbidden in the schools. But the conditions for the use of Figures are not the same in both. For you can speak with success against those declamation tyrants as openly as you please, so long as what you say can be given a different interpretation, because it is only the risk of conviction, not also offence that has to be avoided. If this danger can be eluded by an ambiguous remark, everybody is in favour of the trick. Real life, on the other hand, has never (so far) had this necessity for silence; but it is subject to an analogous necessity, one however which is much more difficult for the speaker to handle, when there are powerful personages presenting an obstruction, and the Cause cannot be maintained without blaming them. Consequently, one must be more wary and circumspect in using such Figures, since <span class="italic">how</span> you give offence makes no difference, and a Figure which is seen through loses its value as a Figure.

He then stands for office as a magistrate. A rival candidate opposes him. The rival, in speaking on his own behalf, has to avoid exposing himself to the capital charge of directly mentioning the extyrant’s past; he can say anything about the man, so long as it cannot be interpreted as amounting to a charge of tyranny. His danger (<span class="italic">periculum</span>) is that of being charged himself. It does not matter if he gives offence.
