by the observation of things conducive to health and sickness and, according to some, is based entirely on experience:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_383_8" id="target_note_LCL124_383_8"><sup>8</sup></a> somebody bandaged a wound before this art existed, and eased a fever by rest and starvation, not because he saw any reason for it, but because that is what the illness itself demanded. Let us not allow building to be an art either: primitive men constructed their huts without art. Music too: singing and dancing of some sort exist in all peoples. So if any speech whatever is to be called “rhetoric,” then I must agree that rhetoric existed before there was an art; but if it is not true that everyone who speaks is an orator, and people did not speak like orators in those days, then they must admit that the orator is produced by art, and did not exist before art.</p>
