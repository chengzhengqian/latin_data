<p>Issues of Conjecture, conclusions reached by Definition, cases dismissed on legal grounds, questions of Competence, cases based on Inference, Contrary Laws, or Ambiguities; there is hardly one of these which does not at some point or other involve the discussion of equity and goodness; and everybody knows that the majority of Causes rest entirely on Quality. Again, in Deliberation, what principle of persuasion is there which does not depend on the question of what is honourable?

Part of this set of problems overflows into Logic, and part into Ethics. All oratory
