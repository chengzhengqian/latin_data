<p>I turn now to things. Of these, actions are the most closely linked to persons, and must therefore be treated first.</p>
<p>With every action, the question is either why or where or when or how or by what means it was done.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_383_29" id="target_note_LCL125_383_29"><sup>29</sup></a> Arguments are therefore drawn (1) from the motives of past or future actions. The material of these motives [which some have called <span class="italic">hylē,</span> others <span class="italic">dynamis</span>]<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_383_30a" id="target_note_LCL125_383_30a"><sup>30</sup></a> falls into two genera, each of which is divided into four species. For the motive of any action is normally to do with the acquisition, increase, preservation, and use of good things, or with the avoidance, riddance, diminution, or tolerance of bad. (These points are also very important in Deliberation.)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_383_31" id="target_note_LCL125_383_31"><sup>31</sup></a> These at least are the motives of right actions; wrong actions, on the other hand, arise from false opinions, because they originate with beliefs about good and evil, and from this spring mistakes and evil emotions, such as anger, hatred, envy, greed, expectation, ambition, audacity, fear, and the like. To these are sometimes added accidental circumstances, drunkenness, or ignorance, which sometimes serve as excuses, and sometimes to prove an offence, as for example when a man is said to have killed one person while lying in wait for another. Furthermore, motives are often considered not only to obtain a conviction for the alleged offence, but also in defence, as when a person contends that he did something rightly, that is for an honourable motive.
