eyes of quails,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_365_6" id="target_note_LCL125_365_6"><sup>6</sup></a> it seems to me that they decided simply that this was a Sign of a pernicious character which would do harm to many if allowed to develop. So too the popular appeal of Spurius Maelius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_365_7" id="target_note_LCL125_365_7"><sup>7</sup></a> and Marcus Manlius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_365_8" id="target_note_LCL125_365_8"><sup>8</sup></a> was judged to be a Sign of their ambition to seize royal power. But I fear that this road is taking us too far. If it is a Sign of an adulteress that she goes to the baths with the men, it will also be one that she dines with young men, or has a close friendship with some men. And one could perhaps say that to have the body hair plucked, to walk with a mincing gait, or to wear clothes like a woman’s were Signs of an effeminate and unmanly character, if one believed that these features were a result of an immoral life in the sense that blood is a result of murder; a Sign, after all, is properly something which presents itself to our eyes, having arisen from the matter under investigation.</p>
<p>Again, the common observations which are generally called “Signs,” like the “prognostics”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_365_9" id="target_note_LCL125_365_9"><sup>9</sup></a>—</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">for wind, gold Phoebe blushes</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">—may well deserve the name, if the reasons for them come from the state of the atmosphere. For if the moon blushes red with wind, the blush is a Sign of wind. And if, as the same poet reasons, the condensation and rarefaction of the air produces “that concert of birds,” we shall think the same of this. There can in fact be small Signs of big things, like that crow; that there are big Signs of smaller things is no surprise to anybody.</p>
