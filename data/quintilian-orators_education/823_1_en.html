in his subject and to Antimachus in Disposition. Apollonius does not appear in the grammarians’ list, because Aristarchus and Aristophanes, who evaluated the poets, included none of their own contemporaries;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_281_54" id="target_note_LCL127_281_54"><sup>54</sup></a> but his consistent maintenance of a moderate level makes his work by no means contemptible. Aratus’ subject lacks movement—no variety, no emotion, no characters, no speeches—but he is well up to the task to which he thought he was equal. Theocritus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_281_55" id="target_note_LCL127_281_55"><sup>55</sup></a> is admirable in his own kind, but this rural, pastoral Muse shuns not only the forum but the city itself. I seem to hear people on all sides suggesting names of many poets. Did not Pisander<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_281_56" id="target_note_LCL127_281_56"><sup>56</sup></a> tell the deeds of Hercules well?

I am not ignorant therefore of poets I am passing over, nor do I necessarily ban them, seeing that I have said that there is some usefulness in all; but we should return to them when our powers are mature and stable.
