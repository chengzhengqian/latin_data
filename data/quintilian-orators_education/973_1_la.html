have different strengths: force and weight and abundance (36)—all Ciceronian qualities.</p>
<p>In what follows (40–48) Quintilian again pursues a <span class="italic">via media.</span> He opposes those who think that the only natural eloquence is that which is indistinguishable from everyday speech; oratory also is “natural,” because its weapons are given us by nature. Hence (45) there is no harm in conceding some indulgence to modern fashions—but not too much: we should have our hair cut, but not elaborately dressed (47).

<p>A further polemic follows (49–57), against some (unnamed) persons who make a sharp difference between speeches composed in writing and those which are created in delivery. Ideally, Quintilian insists, the orator should speak with the same precision as he writes; but this is not always possible, and the attitude of the audience must always be watched. The context of this polemic is obscure to us; its essence however goes back to the fourth century <span class="sc">bc</span> (see N. O’Sullivan, <span class="italic">Alcidamas, Aristophanes, and the Beginnings of Greek Stylistic Theory</span> (Hermes Einzelschriften 60), 1992, 42–62).</p>
<p>12.10.58 makes a fresh start: a second tripartite division is introduced, the famous “three styles”—the “slight,” the “grand,” and the “flowery” or “intermediate.” The history of this classification remains disputed, but it probably goes back to Theophrastus, and one of the most vivid accounts of it is in <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 4.11–17 (see Caplan ad loc.), not apparently used by Quintilian, though other parts of the same book seem to be familiar to him as “Cornificius.” Other important texts are Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <span class="italic">Demosthenes</span> 1–3 (1. 239–252 LCL), and certain passages
