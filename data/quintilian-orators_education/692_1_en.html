<p>Some have held that there was only one Genus of Figures, though they have taken various views even of this: some, on the ground that any change of words entailed also a change of sense, have said that all Figures were a matter of words; others, on the ground that words were adapted to things, have said that they were all a matter of sense. Both of these views are obvious sophistries: for (1) the same things are often said in different ways and the sense stays the same though the expression has been changed, and (2) a Figure of Thought can contain several Figures of Speech, because the former resides in the conception and the latter in the presentation of the thought; they do, however, very often come together, as in “Now, now, Dolabella, neither for you nor for your children . . .”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_19_16" id="target_note_LCL127_19_16"><sup>16</sup></a> Here the Apostrophe, the turning away from the jury, is a Figure of Thought, and <span class="italic">iam iam</span> and <span class="italic">liberum</span> are Figures of Speech.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_19_17" id="target_note_LCL127_19_17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
