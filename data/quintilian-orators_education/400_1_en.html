nature. On the other hand, neither are these of any use without skill.</p>
<p>Students of eloquence should also bear in mind (1) that the things I have pointed out cannot all be found in every Cause, (2) that, when the subject has been set, it is not necessary to chase up all these things one by one, and knock on every door, as it were, in order to discover whether they happen to meet the needs of our Proof—unless indeed one is still a learner and without practical experience. It would cause us infinite delay in preparing a speech if we always had to try out every single Argument and learn by experiment which one is apt and suitable. Indeed, all this may actually become a hindrance, unless some native capacity and the quick thinking that is developed by practice lead us straight to the points which are appropriate to our Cause. For just as the singing voice gives most pleasure with a string accompaniment, and yet, if the hand is slower than the voice and hesitates as to which strings should go with each note until it has looked at them and measured them one by one, it would be better to rest content with what the simple voice produces on its own—so also with the rules of eloquence: there must indeed be a theory fitted to them and tuned like a lyre; but it is long practice that is needed to ensure that, just as the musician’s hands (even if he himself is looking in another direction) move of their own accord to the low or high or middle note, so this variety and abundance of Arguments does nothing to obstruct the orator’s train of thought, but rather offers and presents itself to the mind, as it were, and follows his speech automatically, just as letters and syllables demand no conscious thought from the writer.</p>
