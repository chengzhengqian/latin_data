<p>I do not wish to deny that these processes are useful for some purposes, for example if we have to recall many names of things in the same order as we have heard them. Our experts then set them in the Sites they have learned: a table (for example) in the vestibule, a platform in the atrium, and so on; then, retracing their steps, they find them where they have put them. This may well have been an aid to those who, at the end of a sale, repeated what they had sold to each buyer, precisely as the cashiers’ records testified. Quintus Hortensius is said to have performed this feat.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_71_13" id="target_note_LCL494_71_13"><sup>13</sup></a> But the technique will be less useful for learning by heart what is to be a continuous speech. For on the one hand, <span class="italic">ideas</span> do not have the same images as objects, since we always have to invent a separate sign for them, but a Site may none the less somehow remind us of them, as it may of a conversation held there; on the other hand, how can a <span class="italic">verbal structure</span> be grasped by this art? I say nothing of the fact that there are some words which cannot be represented by any Symbols, for example Conjunctions. For suppose that, like shorthand writers, we have definite Images for all these things and (of course) infinite Sites for them—enough to have room for all the words in the five books of the second pleading against Verres!—and suppose we remember them all, as if they were safe in the bank: will not the run of our speech actually be held up by this double effort of memorizing? How can we produce a continuous flow of words if we have to refer to a distinct Symbol for every individual word? So Charmadas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_71_14" id="target_note_LCL494_71_14"><sup>14</sup></a> and Metrodorus of Scepsis, whom I mentioned just now, both of whom Cicero tells us made use of this sort of training, may be left to their own devices. Let our business be to give some simpler advice.</p>
