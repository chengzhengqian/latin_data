also conferred the power of ready speech will never find himself trapped or caught off his guard. He is always armed and (as it were) in battle order, and his oratory will no more fail him in a Cause than his power of speech in daily domestic matters. He will never shirk the burden on this account, so long as he has time to get up the Cause; for he will always have everything else at his command.</p>

<p class="noindent">It remains to discuss Style.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_281_1" id="target_note_LCL494_281_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This was to be the third subject proposed in my original division; for I promised to speak of (1) the art, (2) the artist, (3) the product.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_281_2" id="target_note_LCL494_281_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Now since Style is the product both of rhetoric and of the orator, and since there are (as I shall show) several forms of it, both the art and the artist are involved in all these, though they are all very different from one another, not only individually (as one statue differs from another, or one painting from another, or one pleading from another) but also generically, as Tuscanic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_281_3" id="target_note_LCL494_281_3"><sup>3</sup></a> statues differ from Greek or the Asianic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_281_4" id="target_note_LCL494_281_4"><sup>4</sup></a> speaker from the Attic. Now these different kinds of work of which I am speaking have each their own masters and indeed their own admirers; and the reason why the perfect orator does not yet exist (and why perhaps no art exists in perfection) is not only that different qualities predominate in different individuals, but that no single form has pleased everybody, partly because of the conditions of particular times or places, and partly because of the tastes and aims of each person.</p>
