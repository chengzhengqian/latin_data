<h2><span class="ac">Introduction</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">We now begin the systematic discussion of the Parts of a Speech.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 deals with the Prooemium (<span class="italic">exordium</span>). Quintilian accepts (4.1.5) the common view that Goodwill, Attentiveness, and Receptiveness are the three aims to be sought. He first (4.1.6–22) examines ways in which the means of securing Goodwill are determined by personal characteristics of pleader, plaintiff, opponents, and judge. Next (4.1.23–33) follows similar consideration of the nature of the Cause. In 4.1.33–39 he passes suddenly (the text is probably lacunose) to consider Attentiveness. Different types of Cause—he lists six—require different sorts of Prooemium (4.1.40–41), and some, in particular, may demand an indirect form, or Insinuation (42–50). After dismissing some opponents’ views, Quintilian proceeds (4.1.52ff.) to give practical advice on the style, manner, and length of Prooemia, and (63–70) on the use of Apostrophe. Finally, we are told that Prooemia are not always necessary (71–72), but may occur in various parts of the speech (73–75). The transition from Prooemium to Narrative is a tricky point (76–79).</p>
