was in the public interest. Necessity then. If so, the fight arose in a moment, and was unpremeditated. One of the two must therefore have set an ambush. Which? Clodius of course. Do you see now how the compulsion of the facts itself provides the Division of the defence? Go a step further. Either he wanted to kill the ambusher, Clodius, or he did not. It is safer if he did not. In that case, Milo’s slaves did it, without Milo’s orders or knowledge.
