So let the fictitious themes themselves be as close to real life as they can be, and the declamation itself, so far as possible, reproduce the pleadings for which it was devised as a training. We shall look in vain, among the forfeits and the interdicts,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_327_3" id="target_note_LCL124_327_3"><sup>3</sup></a> for the magicians, the plagues, the oracles, the stepmothers more cruel than any in tragedy, and the other still more fabulous elements.
