is old now was new once”—and willing to accept expressions which would have been thought questionable in his own youth. A brief word on metaphor (3.38–39) concludes this section; metaphor will be discussed in detail under Tropes.</p>
<p>The discussion of “words in combination” (3.40–90) begins with a list of faults to be avoided (3.41–60; Lausberg §§ 1074–1077), of which the most interesting is the kind of affectation called <span class="italic">cacozelia</span> (3.56): this word has an important role as a critical term. Coming at last to positive features (3.61), Quintilian takes first a particular heightening of the quality of lucidity which he calls by the Greek name <span class="italic">enargeia;</span> this is the vividness which makes the hearer believe he can actually see what is being described (3.61–71). This topic has already been raised in 6.2.29–36, where its relation to imagination (and hence to emotion) was in question: see Introduction to Book Six. Quintilian’s example of the sack of a city (3.67–69; probably suggested by Livy’s Sack of Alba, 1.29) gives a further valuable glimpse into his teaching methods. Closely connected with this is the following discussion of similes (3.72–82)—a topic already raised in 5.11, and to be developed further under Figures, 9.3—which are here viewed as a means of making the subject more vivid. Another means is <span class="italic">emphasis</span> (3.83–86; Lausberg § 578), which also (8.2.11) had a part in Lucidity. The chapter concludes (3.83–90) with some remarks on certain qualities of style—simplicity, abundance, forcefulness, bitterness—of which we should like to have heard more, since they bring to mind the multiplicity of stylistic types (<span class="italic">ideai</span>) found in later theorists, especially Hermogenes. (For the development of this line of thinking, see especially I. Rutherford, 1998.) But all this is hurried
