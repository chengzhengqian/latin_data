<p>What in Latin is called <span class="italic">principium</span> or <span class="italic">exordium,</span> the Greeks seem to have had rather better reasons for calling <span class="italic">prooimion,</span> because our words merely signify “beginning,” whereas theirs makes it clear that this is the part which precedes the introduction of the subject to be treated. Now <span class="italic">oim</span>ē means song, and lyre-players<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_181_1" id="target_note_LCL125_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a> gave the name <span class="italic">prooimion</span> to the short pieces they perform to win favour before they begin the formal competition; it may be for this reason, therefore, that orators also chose this name to denote what they say with the object of winning over the minds of the judges before they start on the actual case.
