it” he will force his adversary to use Conjecture, whereas if he says “You have no case in law” it has to be Inference), we may concede that the Issue originates with the defence. Even so, it will all come back to the fact that the Issue will sometimes be determined by the initiator of the action and sometimes by the respondent.</p>
<p>Let us suppose the charge made by the accuser is “You killed the man.” If the defendant denies it, it is he who produces the Issue. But suppose he admits the fact, but says the adulterer was justifiably killed by him. (It is of course established that there is a law permitting this.)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_57_13" id="target_note_LCL125_57_13"><sup>13</sup></a> Unless the accuser makes some reply, there is no dispute. If he says, “He was not an adulterer,” then the rebuttal of the charge is now the prosecutor’s business, and he will produce the Issue. So the Issue comes from the first rebuttal, and this will originate with the accuser, not with the defendant. Again: the same Question can make the same person either an accuser or a defendant. “No person who has exercised the profession of actor shall sit in the first fourteen rows.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_57_14" id="target_note_LCL125_57_14"><sup>14</sup></a> A man who had performed before the praetor in his private garden, but had never appeared on the public stage, took a seat in the first fourteen front rows.” The accusation is: “You exercised the profession of actor.” The rebuttal is: “No, I did not.” The Question is: “What is meant by ‘exercising the profession of actor’?” If he is accused under the theatre law, the rebuttal will come from the defendant; if he has been thrown out of the theatre and brings an action for injuries, the rebuttal will come from the accuser. However, the common view<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_57_15" id="target_note_LCL125_57_15"><sup>15</sup></a> will suit most situations.</p>
