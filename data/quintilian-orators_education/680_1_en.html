of another, as by Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_467_99" id="target_note_LCL126_467_99"><sup>99</sup></a> in attacking Antony: “What Charybdis is so greedy? Charybdis, do I say? If there ever was a Charybdis, she was only one animal. No: the Ocean, heaven help us, could hardly have swallowed up so many things, so widely scattered, in such distant places, and so quickly!” I have found, I think, a choice model of this in the book entitled <span class="italic">Hymns</span> by the greatest of the lyric poets, Pindar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_467_100" id="target_note_LCL126_467_100"><sup>100</sup></a> When he describes the attack by Hercules upon the Meropes, who are said to have inhabited the island of Cos, he says he was “not like fire nor like the winds nor like the sea, but like the lightning,” as though all the other comparisons were inadequate, and only the last matched the facts. Cicero imitated this when he wrote this passage in the <span class="italic">Verrines</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_467_101" id="target_note_LCL126_467_101"><sup>101</sup></a> “After a long gap, there was now abroad in Sicily not a new Dionysius or a new Phalaris (for that island once bred many cruel tyrants) but a new monster, of that dreadful breed which is said to have haunted those same regions. In my judgement, neither Scylla nor Charybdis was such a menace to ships as he was, in those same narrow seas.”</p>
<p>The types of Attenuation by Hyperbole are just as numerous: “they scarcely stick to their bones,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_467_102" id="target_note_LCL126_467_102"><sup>102</sup></a> or, as [Cicero] in a humorous book:</p>
