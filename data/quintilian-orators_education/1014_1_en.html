These things are never praised while they are being done, but only afterwards; and thus even the most ambitious for renown will find greater reward here. For when the thunders of these perverse displays of oratory have died away to the sound of the preconcerted applause, the renown of real virtue rises stronger still; the judges do not conceal what it was that moved them, well-informed critics are believed;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_273_1" id="target_note_LCL494_273_1"><sup>1</sup></a> there is no true praise for a speech till after it is finished.</p>
