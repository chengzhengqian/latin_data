<p>The first consideration is the nature of a person’s voice, the second its use.</p>
<p>(1) The nature of the voice is seen in terms of volume and quality. Volume is simpler: in brief, the voice is either strong or weak, though there are intermediate kinds between these extremes, and many degrees between the top and the bottom of this scale. Quality is more complex. A voice may be clear or husky, full or thin, smooth or harsh, limited or rich, hard or flexible, resonant or dull.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_93_11" id="target_note_LCL494_93_11"><sup>11</sup></a> The breathing too may be longer or shorter. It is not necessary for our present purpose to investigate the causes of all these variations—whether the difference lies in the part of the body where the breath is formed, or in the pipes, as it were, through which it passes; whether the voice has a nature of its own or just reacts to movements; and whether strength of lungs or chest or even head does more to help it. All in fact are needed, and not only a sweet oral tone: the sound produced by the nose, through which the residue of the voice is expelled, should also be agreeable and not grating.</p>
<p>(2) The use of the voice has many aspects. Apart from the threefold division into Acute, Grave and Circumflex,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_93_12" id="target_note_LCL494_93_12"><sup>12</sup></a> we also need intonations which are from time to time intense or relaxed, higher or lower, and in slower or in quicker time. Between these extremes themselves there are many intermediate stages; just as the face, though made up of very few features, possesses infinite variety, so it is with the voice: there are few varieties to which we can give a name, yet every individual has his own special voice,
