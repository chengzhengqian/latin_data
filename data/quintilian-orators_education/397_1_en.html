superfluous unless you have first seen to what they should be applied. This is something that cannot be covered by textbooks; and this is why, when a number of people have learned the same rules, they will use similar types of Arguments, though one will find more to use than another. Let us take for example a <span class="italic">controversia</span> in which the Questions have very little in common with other themes. “When Alexander sacked Thebes, he found documents showing that the Thebans had lent a hundred talents to the Thessalians. Because he had had the military assistance of the Thessalians, he made them a present of the documents. Later, when the Thebans were restored by Cassander, they claimed repayment from the Thessalians. The case is pleaded before the Amphictyones.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_423_101" id="target_note_LCL125_423_101"><sup>101</sup></a> It is agreed that they lent the hundred talents and have not got it back. The whole dispute hangs on the fact that Alexander is said to have given this present to the Thessalians. It is also agreed that they were not given any money by Alexander. The question therefore is whether his gift is tantamount to his having given money. What use will the Places of Arguments be, unless I first see that his gift had no effect, that he had no power to make it, and that in fact he did not make it?

To answer this, we have to discover in what respect this Cause differs from others relating to property that falls into the power of a conqueror. The problem lies not in the Proof, but in the proposition to be put forward. (1) Let us
