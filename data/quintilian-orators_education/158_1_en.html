conversation is taken up by Polus, whose youthful ardour makes him less circumspect, and it is against Polus that the passage about “shadow” and “flattery” is directed. Then comes Callicles, who is even more ardent, but who is nevertheless led to the conclusion that “the man who is going to be a rhetorician in the correct way must therefore be just and have knowledge of what is just.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_365_33" id="target_note_LCL124_365_33"><sup>33</sup></a> It is obvious, then, that Plato does not think that rhetoric is a bad thing, but that real rhetoric can be attained only by the just and good man.</p>
<p>He makes it even clearer in the <span class="italic">Phaedrus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_365_34" id="target_note_LCL124_365_34"><sup>34</sup></a> that this art cannot be perfect without a knowledge of justice also. I agree with this. Otherwise, would Plato have written his Defence of Socrates and his encomium of the men who fell fighting for their country?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_365_35" id="target_note_LCL124_365_35"><sup>35</sup></a> These are certainly orator’s work. His attack was directed, however, against the class of men who made bad use of their facility in speaking. Socrates even thought the speech which Lysias composed for his defence dishonourable for him to use,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_365_36a" id="target_note_LCL124_365_36a"><sup>36</sup></a> although it was the practice in those days to write speeches for litigants to deliver in court, thereby circumventing the law which forbade one man to speak on behalf of another. The teachers of rhetoric also seemed unsatisfactory to Plato, because they separated rhetoric from justice and preferred the credible to the true: he says this also in the <span class="italic">Phaedrus.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_365_37" id="target_note_LCL124_365_37"><sup>37</sup></a> Cornelius Celsus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_365_38" id="target_note_LCL124_365_38"><sup>38</sup></a> seems to have been of the same opinion as these early rhetors, for he says “The orator seeks only
