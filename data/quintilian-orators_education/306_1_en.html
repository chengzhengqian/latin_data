<p>The Narrative will be brief (1) if we begin to expound the facts from the point where they first concern the judge; (2) if we avoid saying anything irrelevant to the Cause; and (3) if we prune away everything which can be removed without in any way damaging either the process of judgement or our own interest. There is often a sort of conciseness in detail which nevertheless makes the whole thing too long. For example: “I arrived at the harbour, I saw the ship, I asked how much a passage would cost, we agreed the price, I went on board, the anchor was raised, we cast off, we set out on our way.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_241_33" id="target_note_LCL125_241_33"><sup>33</sup></a> None of these details could be put more rapidly, but it would be enough to say “I sailed from the harbour.” And whenever the outcome of an event makes the earlier stages obvious, we ought to rest content with the point that enables all the rest to be understood. So, when it is open to us to say “I have a young son,” it is superfluous to say “As I wanted children, I married a wife; a child was born, I acknowledged him, reared him, and have now brought him to manhood.” For this reason some of the Greeks make a distinction between a concise (<span class="italic">syntomos</span>)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_241_34" id="target_note_LCL125_241_34"><sup>34</sup></a> exposition and a brief one, the former being free from superfluities, and the latter deficient in some necessary points. Our definition of brevity however is not “saying less than one ought to say,” but “not saying more.” I pass over iterations and tautologies and excess verbiage (<span class="italic">perissologia</span>) which some textbook writers say must be avoided in Narrative:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_241_35a" id="target_note_LCL125_241_35a"><sup>35</sup></a> these are faults to be shunned for
