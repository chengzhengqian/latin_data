like “the words fell from the cross.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_329_9" id="target_note_LCL126_329_9"><sup>9</sup></a> However, it does not follow that whatever fails to exhibit Propriety automatically suffers from the fault of Impropriety, because, in the first place, there are many things which have no name either in Greek or in Latin. For example, the verb <span class="italic">iaculari</span> is used of someone throwing a javelin (<span class="italic">iaculum</span>), but there is no special word for the person who throws a ball or a stick. Again it is plain that <span class="italic">lapidare</span> means “to stone,” but there is no word for throwing clods of earth or pieces of pot. Thus “abuse” (<span class="italic">katachrēsis</span>)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_329_10" id="target_note_LCL126_329_10"><sup>10</sup></a> becomes necessary. Metaphor too, which is the greatest ornament of oratory, fits words to things which do not belong to them. Propriety, therefore, is relative not to the word, but to its semantic value, and is to be judged not by the ear but by the understanding.</p>
<p>(2) In the second sense of Propriety, when there are a number of things which share the same term, the “proper” use is that from which the others are derived. For example, <span class="italic">vertex</span> means a whirlpool or anything which spins round in the same way; next, because of the coils of the hair, it comes to mean the top of the head, and from this it is extended to the highest points of mountains.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_329_11" id="target_note_LCL126_329_11"><sup>11</sup></a> All these are rightly called <span class="italic">vertex,</span> but only the original meaning is the “proper” one. So too <span class="italic">solea</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_329_12" id="target_note_LCL126_329_12"><sup>12</sup></a> and <span class="italic">turdus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_329_13" id="target_note_LCL126_329_13"><sup>13</sup></a> are used as names of fish, and so on.</p>
<p>(3) The third kind of Propriety is the reverse of this. It occurs when a thing which is common to various circumstances has a special name in one of them, as a funeral song
