<p>however, must have some features of a Prooemium; it must not start abruptly or wherever we fancy, because in every subject there is something which naturally comes first. In the senate, and certainly in popular assemblies, the same principle of generally winning the goodwill of our audience applies as in the courts. And no wonder, since we seek to win the favour of our hearers even in Panegyrics, where the reward consists not in any actual advantage but solely in praise. Aristotle,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_121_9" id="target_note_LCL125_121_9"><sup>9</sup></a> it is true, holds, and not without reason, that the Prooemium in Deliberative is often based on our own personality or on our opponent’s (as though we were borrowing this feature from the forensic speech), and also that it is sometimes intended to make the subject seem of greater or less importance than it is. In Epideictic, on the other hand, he thinks the Prooemia can be very free, since they can be drawn both from an area remote from the subject (as by Isocrates in his Encomium of Helen)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_121_10" id="target_note_LCL125_121_10"><sup>10</sup></a> and from areas closer to hand (as by Isocrates again in the <span class="italic">Panegyricus,</span> where he complains that more honour is given to physical than to mental prowess, and by Gorgias in the <span class="italic">Olympicus,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_121_11" id="target_note_LCL125_121_11"><sup>11</sup></a> where he praises the founders of such festivals).
