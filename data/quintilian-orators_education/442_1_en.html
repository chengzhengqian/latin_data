<p>“Virtue is a good thing” is true; but if you were to add as a Reason “because it makes men rich,” there would be a false Reason for a true Major Premiss.</p>
<p>(3) With the Conclusion (<span class="italic">conexio</span>), one may either (a) deny its truth (when it makes an inference other than that established by the Premisses) or (b) say that it is irrelevant to the Question. (a) Denial of truth: “An ambusher is justifiably killed; for as he threatens life as an enemy does, he should be repelled like an enemy; Clodius was therefore justifiably killed as an enemy.” Not necessarily, for we have not shown that Clodius set an ambush.

<p>(2) Enthymeme from Consequents: “Virtue, which no one can put to bad use, is a good.” Contrast (3): “Money is not a good; for what can be put to bad use is not a good;
