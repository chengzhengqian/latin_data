<p>But before I discuss Ornament of speech, I must say something about the characteristics which are contrary to this excellence: after all, the primary virtue is to be without vice.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_365_58" id="target_note_LCL126_365_58"><sup>58</sup></a> First of all, then, let us not expect any style to possess Ornament which is not itself acceptable. An acceptable style, according to Cicero,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_365_59" id="target_note_LCL126_365_59"><sup>59</sup></a> is one which is not too well dressed. It is not that style should not be spruced up and polished (that too is a part of Ornament), but excess is everywhere a vice. He therefore calls for authority in the words, and gravity or suitability to human opinions and character in the thoughts. These assured, we can add the means by which he thinks style acquires distinction: choice words, Metaphor, Hyperbole, Epithets, Repetition, Synonyms, and whatever does not conflict with &lt;the case and&gt; the reality to be expressed.</p>
<p>But since I have undertaken first to indicate faults, let us begin with what is called <span class="italic">cacemphaton.</span> This consists either (1) in a phrase perverted by bad usage so as to give an obscene meaning, as by those who (if you can believe it) get a laugh out of <span class="italic">ductare exercitus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_365_60" id="target_note_LCL126_365_60"><sup>60</sup></a> and <span class="italic">patrare bellum,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_365_61a" id="target_note_LCL126_365_61a"><sup>61</sup></a> which are respectable but old-fashioned expressions in Sallust (this is not, in my judgement, the writers’ fault but the readers’, but it is none the less to be avoided, inasmuch as our moral decline has led to the loss of respectable words, and we have to yield even to vices if they are winning); or (2) in a collocation of words which has an unfortunate sound: if we say <span class="italic">cum hominibus notis loqui</span></p>
