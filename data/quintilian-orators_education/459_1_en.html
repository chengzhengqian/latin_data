<p>The Peroration also provides freer opportunities for arousing envy, loathing, and anger. It is undue influence that makes a judge envious, moral turpitude that makes him hate, and disrespect that makes him angry if the defendant is obstinate, arrogant, or too self-confident; and all these feelings are aroused not only by actions and words but by expression, bearing, and appearance. When I was a young man, we greatly admired the remark of the prosecutor of Cossutianus Capito; it was in Greek, but the sense was “Do you blush to be afraid of Caesar?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_25_11" id="target_note_LCL126_25_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>However, the chief way for the prosecution to arouse emotion is to make the charge seem as outrageous or even, if possible, as pitiable as possible.
