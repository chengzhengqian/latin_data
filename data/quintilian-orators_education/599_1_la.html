limiting his treatment to what is oratorically useful, and a refutation of the view that Tropes are simply word changes, and do not involve sentences or word order. He then plunges into Metaphor (6.4–18; Lausberg §§ 558–564), the most important Trope of all. He explains the criteria by which it is justified (necessity, vividness, decency) and treats it as a “shorter simile.” His primary classification (6.9–10) is based on distinguishing “animate” and “inanimate” terms in the analogy which Metaphor sets up. He couples this (6.13) with a further subdivision into Metaphor “from rational to nonrational and vice versa” and “from whole to part and vice versa.” These classifications (which are distinct from, but owe something to, Aristotle’s seminal discussions in <span class="italic">Poetics</span> 21 and <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 3) are found in <span class="italic">VPH</span> (2–26), Trypho (192 Spengel) and later rhetors such as Bede (<span class="italic">RLM</span> 611).</p>
<p>The remaining Tropes are discussed in an order partly based on a classification associated with the Stoics (Barwick (1957) 88–97), though Quintilian does not consistently use Stoic concepts, but conflates them with Aristotelian ones. The essential classification is into variations from the norm suggested by (1) similarity (as in Metaphor), (2) <span class="italic">vicinitas,</span> “neighbourhood,” “proximity” (as in Synecdoche), and (3) “contrariety” (as in some Allegory). Metaphor having already been discussed, we have first three <span class="italic">vicinitas</span> tropes: (a) Synecdoche (6.19–22; <span class="italic">VPH</span> 22, <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 4.44–46; Lausberg §§ 572–577); (b) Metonymy (6.23–28; <span class="italic">VPH</span> 23, <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 4.43; Lausberg §§ 565–571); (c) Antonomasia (6.29–30; <span class="italic">VPH</span> 24; <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 4.42; Lausberg §§ 580–581). Next comes Onomatopoeia (6.31–33; <span class="italic">VPH</span> 16; <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 4.42; Demetrius 94–95), which here means word-coining, not necessarily
