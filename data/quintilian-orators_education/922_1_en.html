Delivery, and he gave it the second and the third place too, until they stopped asking; we must therefore suppose that he thought of it not just as the first faculty needed, but as the only one. (This is why he himself studied with such diligence under the actor Andronicus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_89_4" id="target_note_LCL494_89_4"><sup>4</sup></a> that, when the Rhodians admired the written version of his great speech, Aeschines is thought to have said (and very justifiably) “If only you had heard him in person!”)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_89_5" id="target_note_LCL494_89_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Likewise Cicero: he too thinks that Delivery has a unique dominance in oratory. He tells us that Gnaeus Lentulus got more reputation from this than from his eloquence,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_89_6" id="target_note_LCL494_89_6"><sup>6</sup></a> that Gaius Gracchus moved the whole Roman people to tears by this means, when he wept for his brother’s death,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_89_7" id="target_note_LCL494_89_7"><sup>7</sup></a> and that Antonius and Crassus were very strong in this way, but Quintus Hortensius strongest of all.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_89_8" id="target_note_LCL494_89_8"><sup>8</sup></a> This is supported by the fact that Hortensius’ written works are far from justifying the reputation which caused him to be long regarded as the leading orator, then for a time as Cicero’s rival, and finally, for the rest of his life, as second only to Cicero. There must obviously have been some attractions in his speaking which we do not find when we read him. Indeed, since words are very powerful by themselves, and the voice adds its own contribution to the content, and gestures and movements have a meaning, then, when they all come together, the result must be perfection.</p>
<p>However, there are those who think that raw delivery, such as is produced by the impulse of a person’s feelings, is stronger, and is in fact the only kind worthy of a real man. These are in general the same people who habitually disapprove</p>
