right is given once, does it apply on more occasions? “A priestess convicted of incest and thrown off the Rock survived; she is charged again.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_279_3" id="target_note_LCL126_279_3"><sup>3</sup></a> (2) If a provision applies to one event, does it apply to several? “A man who has killed two tyrants at one time claims two rewards.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_279_4" id="target_note_LCL126_279_4"><sup>4</sup></a> (3) Does what applied before an event also apply afterwards? “A rapist fled the country, his victim married; he has returned, and she now demands her choice.” (4) Does what applies to the whole apply to a part? “It is forbidden to accept a plough as a pledge; he has accepted the ploughshare.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_279_5" id="target_note_LCL126_279_5"><sup>5</sup></a> (5) Does what applies to the part apply to the whole? “It is forbidden to export wool from Tarentum; he has exported sheep.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_279_6" id="target_note_LCL126_279_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>In these cases, the Syllogism relies also on the Letter of the law; for the prosecutor says that the provisions are adequate—“I demand that the unchaste priestess shall be thrown off the Rock; this is the law”; “the victim claims her choice”; “wool is on a sheep,” and so on; but, as the other side can reply “It is not stated that the condemned woman should be thrown over twice” or “that a victim of rape should exercise her choice at any time” or “that a tyrannicide should receive two rewards,” or again that “nothing is said about a ploughshare” or “about sheep,” it follows that an inference is being made from a certain fact to an uncertain one. (6) It is a more difficult business to infer from the Letter what is not stated: that is, “since A, therefore B.” “A man who has killed his father shall be sewn up in a sack.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_279_7" id="target_note_LCL126_279_7"><sup>7</sup></a> He has killed his <span class="italic">mother.</span>” “It is illegal to drag a man to court from his house.
