had begun with the whole physique, it would have been an anticlimax to come down to the lungs and the throat. There is also a natural order: “men and women,” “day and night,” “rising and setting,” though the reverse does occur also. Some words become superfluous when you change the order. Take <span class="italic">fratres gemini,</span> “twin brothers”: if <span class="italic">gemini</span> has come first, there is no need to add <span class="italic">fratres.</span> The rule given by some theorists, that nouns should precede verbs, verbs adverbs, nouns adjectives, and pronouns nouns, is much too rigid, for the contrary order is often excellent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_175_18a" id="target_note_LCL127_175_18a"><sup>18</sup></a> Another piece of gross superstition is the idea that as things come first in time, so they should also come first in order. It is not that this is not frequently the better course, but earlier events are sometimes more important and so have to be given a position of climax over the less significant.</p>
<p>If Composition allows, it is much best to end with a verb, for the force of language is in the verbs. If this proves harsh, the principle will give way to Rhythm, as often happens in the greatest orators, both Greek and Latin. Of course, every verb which does not come at the end will give us a Hyperbaton; but this itself counts as a Trope or a Figure, and these are good features.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_175_19" id="target_note_LCL127_175_19"><sup>19</sup></a> The point is that words are not measured according to metrical feet; they are therefore moved from one place to another so as to join where they fit best, just as, in constructions made of unhewn stones, the irregularity itself suggests the right stones which each piece can fit or rest upon. However, the most successful style is that in which natural Order, well-fitting Linkage, and appropriate Rhythm are all found.
