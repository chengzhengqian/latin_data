<p>is a rare thing, but it can be of use. Cicero employs it in his speech <span class="italic">On the Replies of the Soothsayers,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_455_54" id="target_note_LCL125_455_54"><sup>54</sup></a> in his address to the Assembly against Catiline,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_455_55" id="target_note_LCL125_455_55"><sup>55</sup></a> when he points to the figure of Jupiter on the top of the column, and in <span class="italic">Pro Ligario,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_455_56" id="target_note_LCL125_455_56"><sup>56</sup></a> when he confesses that Caesar’s cause was the better one, because the gods judged it so. When these belong to the Cause, they are called “divine testimonies”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_455_57" id="target_note_LCL125_455_57"><sup>57</sup></a> when they are adduced from other sources, they are Arguments.</p>
<p>It is sometimes also possible to take some remark or action of the judge or your opponent or your opponent’s advocate in order to strengthen your point. This has led some writers to treat Examples and these Authorities under Nontechnical Proofs, because the orator does not discover them but has them handed to him. But there is a great difference. Witnesses, examinations under torture, and the like make statements about the actual matter before the court; anything brought in from outside, unless one has the ability to apply it to some useful purpose in the current dispute, has no value in itself.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">Uses of Arguments</span></span>
<p>This is pretty well everything I know at present about Proof, either from the writings of others or from my own experience. I have not the confidence to assert that this is all there is; indeed, I urge further research, and admit that discoveries may yet be made. However, whatever comes to be added will not be very different. I now add a few remarks on how Arguments should be used.</p>
