series, they have a jerky effect. Ascent from short to long lends vigour; descent from long to short makes for a gentler tone. It is best to begin with long syllables, but it may sometimes be right to begin with a short, as in <span class="italic">n</span>ŏ<span class="italic">vum crimen</span>;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_213_91" id="target_note_LCL127_213_91"><sup>91</sup></a> a lighter effect is given by two shorts, as in ă<span class="italic">nĭmadverti, iudices,</span> but this is perfectly right for <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_213_92" id="target_note_LCL127_213_92"><sup>92</sup></a> because the beginning of that speech resembles a Partition, and Partitions like rapidity. The clausula also is most secure if it consists of long syllables; but a sentence does sometimes end on shorts, although the final syllable is regarded as indifferent. I am aware of course that a short is treated as a long in final position, because there seems to be a bit of vacant time accruing to it from what follows; however, when I consult my own ears, I realize that it makes a great difference whether the closing syllable is really long or merely treated as long, for there is not the same fullness in <span class="italic">dicere incipientem timer</span>ĕ as in <span class="italic">ausus est confiterī.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_213_93" id="target_note_LCL127_213_93"><sup>93</sup></a> However, if it is indeed irrelevant whether the final syllable is short or long, the foot will be the same in either case; yet, somehow, the long will mark an ending, the short only a brief stop. This consideration has induced some scholars to assign three time units to a final long syllable, making the extra time which a short syllable acquires from its position accrue to a long syllable as well.</p>
<p>And it is not only the closing foot that matters, but the one that precedes it. One should go back not more than three feet from the end (far be it from us to keep poets’ rules!) and then only if they are not three-syllable feet, but at least two, because otherwise the clausula will be a foot and not a Rhythm. However, a single foot may be enough, either a Dichoreus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_213_94" id="target_note_LCL127_213_94"><sup>94</sup></a> (if we can regard this compound of two Chorei as a single foot) or the form of Paean which is a
