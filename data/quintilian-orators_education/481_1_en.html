voice to confess it, but convulses the whole body with its violence. And (as I said)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_69_5" id="target_note_LCL126_69_5"><sup>5</sup></a> it often turns the scale in very important matters, as it frequently dispels hatred and anger. A proof of this is the story of the young men of Tarentum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_69_6" id="target_note_LCL126_69_6"><sup>6</sup></a> who had said a lot of bad things about King Pyrrhus at dinner. Called upon to explain themselves, as the offence could be neither denied nor justified, they escaped by means of a laugh and a timely joke. One of them said “To tell you the truth, if there had been any more in the bottle, we should have killed you,” and this witticism made all the animosity of the charge evaporate.</p>
<p>Whatever this quality is, however, though I should not dare to say that it is entirely without art (for it does involve some observance of principles, and rules relating to it have been drawn up by both Greek and Latin writers), I am quite clear that it mainly depends on nature and on opportunity. (1) The effect of nature is not only that one person is more acute or more inventive than another (this of course could be developed by teaching) but that some people have a particular grace of bearing or countenance, so that the same remarks made by others seem less witty. (2) Opportunity (which is so powerful that it often helps not only the unlearned but simple country folk to say witty things) depends both on situations and on what a previous speaker has said; for all these things have much more charm as repartees than as challenges.</p>
<p>The difficulty is increased by the fact that there are no exercises and no teachers of this subject. Many people therefore display their wit at dinner parties and in conversation, because we may progress in this by daily practice, whereas specifically oratorical wit is rare, for it does not come from any special skill, but is borrowed from this
