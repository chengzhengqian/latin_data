<p>I have come to mention Quality thus incidentally; but it is in fact next in order.</p>
<h3><span class="ac">Chapter 4</span></h3>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Division in Issues of Quality</span></span>
<p>There is another<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_237_1" id="target_note_LCL126_237_1"><sup>1</sup></a> sort of Quality, concerned with things in general, and a complex one at that, since we can ask about both the nature and the form of a thing—whether the soul is immortal, whether god has a human appearance—and also about its size and number—how big is the sun, whether there is only one universe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_237_2" id="target_note_LCL126_237_2"><sup>2</sup></a> All these problems are argued by Conjecture, but the Question they contain is one of a thing’s Quality. They are sometimes treated in deliberative exercises too; for example, if Caesar is debating whether to attack Britain, we must bring into the debate the nature of the Ocean, whether Britain is an island (this was not known at the time),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_237_3a" id="target_note_LCL126_237_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> what its area is, and what size of force is needed for the invasion. To Quality in this sense also belongs what should or should not be done, or should be sought or avoided.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_237_4" id="target_note_LCL126_237_4"><sup>4</sup></a> These topics occur mainly of course in deliberative exercises, but they are common also in forensic, with the one difference that the former deals with the future and the latter with the past. Again, all the themes of Epideictic come under this Issue: the fact is admitted, the question turns on the Quality of the fact.</p>
<p>Every dispute involves &lt;equity and its opposite,&gt; reward,
