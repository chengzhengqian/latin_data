<p>(2) Outside the Cause, witnesses are often asked many things which may be of value to us, about the life of other witnesses or about their own: for example any scandal or degradation, friendship with the accuser, or hostility towards the defendant. Here they may either say something which is in our favour, or be caught out in a lie or in the wish to do harm. Above all, however, the interrogation must be, on the one hand, circumspect (because witnesses often make clever answers to disconcert defence advocates, and this is something commonly viewed with great favour) and, on the other hand, couched, so far as possible, in the language of ordinary speech, so that the witness (who is more often than not a person of no education) understands, or does not claim not to understand (this could be a serious embarrassment to the interrogator).</p>
<p>It is a disreputable practice, however, to do a deal with a witness and send him to sit on the opposing benches, so that, being called from that side, he does more damage, either by speaking against the defendant with whom he has been sitting, or else, while appearing to have helped him with his testimony, by deliberately giving much of it in an extravagant and exaggerated manner, so as not only to discredit his own statement but to cancel out the value of others who had previously been helpful. I mention these devices not to recommend them, but to warn against them.</p>

<p>Written evidence and oral evidence often conflict. There are general arguments on both sides. One party relies on the oath, the other on the agreement of the signatories.</p>
