whole affair!—while others go too far: I once heard someone say about the Germans “And the head somewhere up there,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_421_39" id="target_note_LCL126_421_39"><sup>39</sup></a> and of a war hero “He beats back wars with his shield boss.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_421_40" id="target_note_LCL126_421_40"><sup>40</sup></a> But we shall never be finished, if I list all the various forms of decadence. I turn to a more vital matter.</p>
<p>There are two opposing schools of thought, those for whom <span class="italic">sententiae</span> are almost the sole object, and those who ban them altogether. I do not much like either view. Crowded together, <span class="italic">sententiae</span> get in one another’s way, just as with all crops and fruit on trees nothing can develop to its proper size if it lacks room to grow. In a painting, too, nothing stands out except against a surrounding background; this is why artists who include a number of subjects in the same picture separate them by some distance, so that no shadows fall upon the bodies. Such density also produces a fragmented effect, because each <span class="italic">sententia</span> stands on its own, and there must therefore be a fresh beginning after it. This leads as a rule to a broken style, made up not of <span class="italic">cola</span> but of tiny scraps, and devoid of structure, because these rounded and whittled-down phrases cannot support one another. Besides, the whole tone of the speech, brilliant as it may be, is bespattered, as it were, with dirty marks of various kinds. Again, a stripe or some purple in the right place adds a touch of splendour,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_421_41" id="target_note_LCL126_421_41"><sup>41</sup></a> but a dress with a number of different marks in the weave would suit no one. Hence, though these things seem to glitter and to some extent to stand out, their brilliance may be said to resemble not so much a flame as a few sparks emerging
