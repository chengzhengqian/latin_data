problems produced by the attitude of the client. Declamation (once again!) can be a bad teacher for real life (1.43–45). Appeals to pity can be subverted (1.46–49). Epilogues are not always emotional, and emotional appeals are in place also in other parts of the speech (1.51–54).</p>
<p>This leads (6.2) to Quintilian’s more general discussion of <span class="italic">pathos,</span> one of the most interesting parts of the work. Here, as so often, he is much indebted to Cicero (<span class="italic">De oratore</span> 2.178–216, well set in context by Leeman–Pinkster–Rabbie <span class="italic">ad loc.,</span> and by W. Wisse, <span class="italic">Ethos and Pathos from Aristotle to Cicero</span> (Amsterdam, 1989)), who also stresses the dominant power of emotion. For Quintilian, as for Cicero, <span class="italic">pathos</span> and <span class="italic">ēthos</span> (i.e. attractiveness of character) are complementary means of achieving rhetorical success; the speaker must be able to adopt different tones and levels of intensity as his subject requires (see in general Lausberg § 257; C. Gill, <span class="italic">Classical Quarterly</span> 34 (1984) 149–166). But it is natural also to think of “Longinus,” quite possibly Quintilian’s contemporary: but “Longinus’” agenda is different, for he is more concerned with the psychological basis of “sublimity,” and sees <span class="italic">pathos</span> and <span class="italic">ēthos</span> as fundamentally opposed to each other. And later in our chapter, after he has dealt with the general uses of emotion and the particular <span class="italic">pathē</span> of fear and indignation (2.8–24), Quintilian proceeds to a discussion which very strongly recalls “Longinus” (15): he advances a theory of <span class="italic">how</span> we can come to feel the emotions ourselves (which everyone agrees we should do), namely by utilizing our natural capacity, idly displayed in daydreaming, for imagining or visualizing situations (<span class="italic">phantasia, enargeia</span>).</p>
