<p>In dividing words also, one has to consider whether a middle consonant belongs to the preceding syllable or the following one: in <span class="italic">haruspex,</span> the second part of which comes from <span class="italic">specto,</span> the <span class="italic">s</span> belongs to the third syllable; whereas in <span class="italic">abstemius,</span> which is a compound meaning <span class="italic">abstinentia temeti,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_189_9" id="target_note_LCL124_189_9"><sup>9</sup></a> the <span class="italic">s</span> stays with the first syllable.</p>
<p>As for <span class="italic">k,</span> my view is that it should not be used in any words except those which it stands for even if it is put by itself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_189_10" id="target_note_LCL124_189_10"><sup>10</sup></a> I mention this because some hold that it is obligatory when <span class="italic">a</span> follows, although we possess <span class="italic">c,</span> which is capable of passing its force on to any vowel.</p>

I pass over the earliest period, when there were fewer letters and the shapes were different from ours, and also the value. Thus in Greek the letter <span class="italic">o</span> was sometimes long and short (as with us) and sometimes stood for the syllable which its name expresses;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_189_11" id="target_note_LCL124_189_11"><sup>11</sup></a> just as the fact that in old Latin writings <span class="italic">d</span> was added at the end of many words<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_189_12" id="target_note_LCL124_189_12"><sup>12</sup></a> is established by the column with the beaks of ships erected in honour of Duilius in the Forum;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_189_13" id="target_note_LCL124_189_13"><sup>13</sup></a> so some times also is <span class="italic">g,</span> as in <span class="italic">vesperug</span> on the</p>
