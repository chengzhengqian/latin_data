<p>So let us above all put ample time and place at the disposal of the parties to the affair, and positively encourage them to tell their story as fully as they like, and go back as far as they want, giving them time to do so. It is less harmful to listen to irrelevances than to be ignorant of essentials. The orator will often discover both damage and the remedy for the damage in facts which the litigant believed to have no importance one way or another. The person who has to plead should not trust his memory so completely as not to take the trouble to write down what he hears, nor should he be satisfied with hearing it once: the litigant should be made to repeat his statement twice or even more, not only because some points may have escaped him in his first statement (especially if, as often happens, he is inexperienced), but so that we can know whether he keeps to the same story. Most litigants lie, and talk as if they were pleading the case, not giving instructions, and addressing the judge, not briefing their advocate. We must therefore never quite believe the client, but test him in every way, and try to confuse him and draw him out. Just as doctors have not only to cure the diseases that present themselves but to discover hidden ones, which the patients themselves often conceal, so too the advocate must look for more than is disclosed to him.</p>
<p>Thus when he has devoted enough patience to listening, he must change his role again and act the part of the adversary, putting forward every conceivable objection and every consideration which the nature of the case makes possible in a discussion of this kind. The client must be subjected to a thoroughly hostile examination, and pressed hard. By looking for everything, we sometimes arrive at the truth where we least expected to find it.</p>
