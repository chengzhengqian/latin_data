Halm = 23 Giomini–Celentano; Hermogenes 59,11ff. Rabe (Heath (1995) 43ff.); Lausberg §§ 166–170). Definition is the next resource of the defendant who cannot deny the fact (1–2); all Definitions comprise Genus, Species, Differentia, and Properties (3). The Question may be either what should fall under a certain name, or what name a certain thing should be given (4). It may be related to Conjecture or to Quality (5–6)—indeed (13) some scholars deny the separate existence of this Issue altogether. Quintilian himself (9–11) distinguishes three types: Is the word applicable? Which of two terms is applicable? Should two things differing in species be given the same generic name? Some think (14) that the whole business is for philosophical debaters, not for pleaders in court; and Quintilian so far agrees with this as to warn that a Definition must be quite impregnable (18) if it is to be any use. The <span class="italic">divisio</span> falls into two: “what a thing is” (19–27) and “whether it is this” (28–30). The chapter concludes (30–34) with one of Quintilian’s more amusing declamation themes—the young men who build a mock tomb on the beach—and with a transition (35) to the discussion of Quality.</p>
<p>Quality (7.4) covers many different types of case. Outline in Lausberg §§ 174–195; important texts include <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 2.19–26, Cicero, <span class="italic">De inventione</span> 2.69–115, Hermogenes 65–76 Rabe (with Heath (1995) 46–49, who calls this Issue “Counterplea”). Quintilian’s treatment is fairly methodical. After a brief introduction (1–3), discussing Quality in deliberative and epideictic oratory, he turns (4–6) to the first main branch, <span class="italic">qualitas absoluta</span> (Greek <span class="italic">antilēpsis</span>), i.e. the claim that the act alleged is honourable. The second type (<span class="italic">qualitas assumptiva:</span> Greek <span class="italic">antithesis</span>)
