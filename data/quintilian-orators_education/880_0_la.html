and his ideal of the orator as <span class="italic">vir bonus</span> and not simply a technician, is extraordinarily full, and strongly oriented towards practical needs. He begins (11.1.1–5) by discussing Cicero’s treatment in his oratorical works. Next (6–7) he briefly shows that the different parts of a speech have different requirements of “aptness.” There follows (8–15) a passage in which, while admitting that “that which is becoming” (<span class="italic">quod decet</span>) and “that which is expedient” (<span class="italic">quod expedit</span>) may be different, Quintilian argues that they usually coincide, and that anyway the honourable course is always “becoming,” whatever concessions may be made to particular circumstances. In 15–28 he discusses the problem of how to praise oneself, an area in which Cicero has been seen to be at fault; we have a good discussion of this, which complements Quintilian, in Plutarch, <span class="italic">Moralia</span> 539A–547F: see also Quintilian’s pupil Pliny, <span class="italic">Epist</span>. 1.8. Propriety in delivery (29–30) claims attention next; then propriety in the sense of appropriateness to the person (a) of the speaker (31–41), (b) of the client, the judge, and others present (42). Appropriateness to circumstances is a separate head (43–56), and we have a short account (57–59) of the requirement of appropriateness to opponents. But a third of the whole chapter (60–93) is devoted to difficult cases of various kinds, with (as usual) abundant examples from Cicero.</p>
<p>11.2, Quintilian’s treatise on memory, is to be compared with <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 3.28–40, Cicero, <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 2.350–360, Cassius Longinus, <span class="italic">Ars rhetorica</span> 197–206 Spengel–Hammer; Fortunatianus (<span class="italic">RLM</span> 128–130 Halm) summarizes Quintilian. Memory training goes back to early times: a text usually dated c. 400 <span class="sc">bc</span> (<span class="italic">Dissoi Logoi</span>) recommends tricks like thinking of “gold” (<span class="italic">chrysos</span>) and “a
