Domitius is the superior in art and in his whole style of oratory. One would not be afraid to count him among the ancients. Africanus was more lively, but too meticulous in his choice of words, often diffuse in Composition, and extravagant in his metaphors. There have been distinguished talents also in more recent days. Trachalus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_317_154" id="target_note_LCL127_317_154"><sup>154</sup></a> was in general elevated and pretty clear; one could believe that his ideals were high. But he was better to listen to than to read, for he had every possible external advantage—a lovely voice, unique in my experience, a delivery which would have graced the stage, and great personal beauty. Vibius Crispus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_317_155" id="target_note_LCL127_317_155"><sup>155</sup></a> too, was smooth, agreeable, born to please, but better in private cases than in public ones. Julius Secundus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_317_156" id="target_note_LCL127_317_156"><sup>156</sup></a> had he enjoyed a longer life, would certainly have had a great reputation with posterity as an orator, for he would have added to his other virtues (as indeed he was already doing) the element that can be thought lacking in him, namely a much more aggressive attitude and a willingness to attend more often to the content rather than the words. Yet, even though his career was cut short, he can claim an important place, thanks to his facility, the grace with which he sets out what he wants, his lucid, smooth, and beautiful style, his propriety in the use of words (even those transferred from other senses),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_317_157" id="target_note_LCL127_317_157"><sup>157</sup></a> and the pregnant force of some of his most hazardous expressions.</p>
<p>Those who write about orators in the future will find ample material for genuine praise in those who are now in their prime, for the talents which grace the courts today are very great. The mature advocates rival the ancients,
