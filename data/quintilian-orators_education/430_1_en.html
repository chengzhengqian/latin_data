superfluous task, for it is a criticism not of the Cause but of the speaker. For my part, I should always wish the speaker to be thought a person of eloquence, so that anything he says to the advantage of his case can be credited to his talents and not to the Cause, while if he says what damages it, the blame can be attached to the Cause and not to his talents. So Cicero’s criticisms (for example) of obscurity (as against Rullus),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_487_32" id="target_note_LCL125_487_32"><sup>32</sup></a> incapacity as a speaker (as against Piso),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_487_33" id="target_note_LCL125_487_33"><sup>33</sup></a> ignorance of things and words and utter tastelessness (as against Antony)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_487_34" id="target_note_LCL125_487_34"><sup>34</sup></a> are a concession to passion and justified resentment; they have a practical use in stirring up ill feeling against those whom you wish to make disliked.</p>
<p>Replying to advocates requires a different method, and occasionally it may be right to criticize not only their speech, but their way of life, their expression, their walk, or their bearing. Thus Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_489_35" id="target_note_LCL125_489_35"><sup>35</sup></a> in his attack on Quintius inveighs not only against all these, but even against the way his toga falls about his heels; for Quintius had attacked Cluentius in violent public speeches. Sometimes, to dispel unpopularity, a sharp remark can be turned aside with a joke, as Cicero did with Triarius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_489_36" id="target_note_LCL125_489_36"><sup>36</sup></a> For when the latter said that Scaurus’ columns were carried through Rome on waggons, Cicero retorted: “Why, I have columns from Alba, and did I bring them in panniers?” This move is more permissible against the accusers, whom one’s duty as defence advocate sometimes obliges one to insult. On the other hand, it is an acceptable and by no means discourteous complaint against any speaker to observe that he has disingenuously passed over, cut short, obscured, or postponed some point or other. Anticipated tactics on the part
