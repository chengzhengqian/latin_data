<p>There remain the writers on philosophy. Roman literature has so far produced very few eloquent authors of this kind. Cicero, as in everything else, stands out here too as a rival to Plato. Brutus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_319_158" id="target_note_LCL127_319_158"><sup>158</sup></a>—excellent in this, and much better than in his speeches—had the strength to support the weight of the subject; you can tell he feels what he says. Cornelius Celsus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_319_159" id="target_note_LCL127_319_159"><sup>159</sup></a> a follower of the Sextii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_319_160" id="target_note_LCL127_319_160"><sup>160</sup></a> wrote a good deal, and with elegance and polish.

This came about when I was trying to recall a decadent manner of writing, enfeebled by all kinds of errors, to a severer standard.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_319_163" id="target_note_LCL127_319_163"><sup>163</sup></a> Now at that time Seneca was almost the only author in young men’s hands.
