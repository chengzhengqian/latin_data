(On the nature of Stoic rhetoric and Quintilian’s reaction to it, see C. Atherton, <span class="italic">Classical Quarterly</span> 38 (1988) 392–427.) Quintilian offers a worldly version of this. Acknowledging that rhetoric may be a “non-art” or a “bad” or “pointless” art, he would claim that the ideal rhetoric towards which his education is intended to lead is indeed a “virtue.” (For his general view of the relation between oratory and morality, see M. Winterbottom in <span class="italic">Journal of Roman Studies</span> 54 (1964) 90–97 and the same writer’s “Quintilian the Moralist” in <span class="italic">QHAR</span> 1. 317–336.)</p>
<p>Finally (2.21) Quintilian deals with another topic of the Hellenistic debate, and opposes the view that rhetoric cannot be an art because it has no special subject matter.</p>
