<p>our palms away to the left to express horror, or (3) making an objection by thrusting them forward, or (4) stretching both hands out sideways, or (5) lowering them in apology or supplication (but note that these are distinct Gestures), or finally (6) raising them in prayer or stretching them out to point to something or in an invocation: “Ye hills and groves of Alba”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_145_75" id="target_note_LCL494_145_75"><sup>75</sup></a> or Gracchus’ “Where shall I turn in my misery?

The use of the two hands together produces more emotion in such passages; when the subject is unimportant, unthreatening, or sad, they are held close to the body; with grander themes, or when joy or outrage is called for, they are thrust further forward.</p>
<p>I must mention here faults of hand gestures into which even experienced pleaders often fall. The Gesture of demanding a cup, threatening a flogging, or indicating the number 500 by crooking the thumb,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_145_77" id="target_note_LCL494_145_77"><sup>77</sup></a> all of which are mentioned by some writers, I have never seen, even in uneducated speakers. But I know some things that do often happen: an arm is exposed and we catch a glimpse of the speaker’s side; a man dares not stick his hand out beyond the fold of his toga; another stretches his arm out to its full length, raises it towards the roof, or swings it back and forth over his left shoulder, raining down blows to the rear, so that it is dangerous to be standing behind him;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_145_78" id="target_note_LCL494_145_78"><sup>78</sup></a> another makes a leftwards sweep, waves his hand around at random and hits his neighbours, or else flaps both elbows
