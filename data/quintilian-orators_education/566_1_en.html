penalty, or the amount of these.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_239_5" id="target_note_LCL126_239_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Causes may be simple or comparative. In the former case, the question is what is fair; in the latter, what is fairer or fairest. When the judgement concerns a penalty, the pleader must either defend, extenuate, or excuse the alleged act, or, as some think, beg for mercy.</p>

<p>Much the strongest defence is to say that the act alleged is itself honourable. A son is disinherited because he has served as a soldier, sought office, or married, against his father’s wishes. We defend what we did.

All justice rests either (1) on nature or (2) on convention. (1) “Nature” includes whatever is done because of the intrinsic value of the particular action. Under this head come piety, good faith, self-control, and the like. Some add “parity,” but this is not a point to consider without careful thought, because the use of force against force and the “eye for an eye” principle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_239_9" id="target_note_LCL126_239_9"><sup>9</sup></a> involve no injustice towards the aggressor, while parity of actions does not imply that the first action was just.
