basic process as Hermagoras saw it. It involved (1) the accuser’s <span class="italic">intentio,</span> (2) the defendant’s <span class="italic">depulsio</span>: from these emerged the <span class="italic">quaestio</span> (<span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 1.18). Next (3) the defendant produced his <span class="italic">ratio,</span> and (4) the accuser tried to refute it (<span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> calls this stage <span class="italic">firmamentum,</span> a term mentioned also by Quintilian, 3.11.1). From (3) and (4) derived the Point for Decision (τò κρινóμενoν). The example in <span class="italic">De inventione</span> 2.78, the charge against Horatius for killing his sister, illustrates this clearly. (1) “You killed your sister without justification”; (2) “I was justified”; the Question is “Was he justified?”; (3) “She was distressed at our victory, and grieved by the enemy’s death”; (4) “But she ought not to have been killed by her brother without trial.” Point for Decision: “Given all the circumstances, should he have killed her without trial?”</p>
<p>Quintilian deals first (11.1–3) with the definition of the “principal Question”; then with Line of Defence <span class="italic">(ratio)</span> and Point for Decision (11.4–8), with a discussion of terminology and illustration from the stock case of Orestes; next comes “Core” (11.9); he then proceeds to discuss various problems, illustrating them again from stock cases (11.10–17). Inconsistencies in Cicero come in for criticism (11.18–20); but Quintilian is mainly concerned (11.21–26) with simplifying the subject and reducing it to what the student really needs to know. His impatience with the pedantry and vanity of the scholars is clear, and characteristic. His own account is, it must be said, not at all clear: see M. Heath in <span class="italic">Classical Quarterly</span> 44 (1994) 122–123.</p>
