<p>relates to the outcome, not to the Cause, and to the decision of the judge, not to the reason which makes him give the decision. Compare: “You deserve to be punished,” “No, I don’t.” Here the judge will decide whether he deserves to be punished or not. There is no Question here, and no Issue. So where is it? “You deserve to be punished, for you killed a man”; “I did not kill him.” The Question is whether he did kill him. Again: “I deserve to be honoured,” “You do not.” Is there an Issue here? In my opinion, no. “I deserve to be honoured because I killed the tyrant,” “You didn’t kill him.” Here there is both a Question and an Issue. Likewise: “You are not right to bring this action,” “I am” has no Issue. So where is the Issue? “You are not right to bring the action because you have been deprived of your rights.” The Question now is whether he has been so deprived, or whether a person so deprived is capable of bringing an action. Here there are Questions and Issues. Thus there is a type of Cause which is “transferential,” as there is a “comparative” type and a type of “mutual accusation.”</p>
<p>But (it may be said) “You killed him,” “I did so justifiably” is just like “I have the right,” “No, you don’t.” I do not deny this, but neither does this produce an Issue. For these are not Propositions (without which the Cause will not be able to be developed) unless their reasons are added. “Horatius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_87_77" id="target_note_LCL125_87_77"><sup>77</sup></a> committed a crime, because he killed his sister.” “He did not commit a crime, because it was his duty to kill a woman who was mourning for the death of an enemy.” The Question here is whether the cause was just; so the Issue is Quality. Similarly in Transference: “You do not have the right to disown,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_87_78" id="target_note_LCL125_87_78"><sup>78</sup></a> because a man deprived of citizen rights has no right of action”; “I do have the right to
