<p>It was of great concern to the ancients to seek elegance of speech by means of 〈similar,〉 equal, and balancing words. Gorgias went too far in this, and Isocrates used the device abundantly, at least in his early period. Even Cicero took delight in it, but he applied restraint to a pleasure which is indeed attractive unless it is used in excess, and gave substance to what is other wise a trivial device by the weightiness of his thoughts. In itself a feeble and empty affectation, it seems to acquire a natural and not just an artificial 〈charm〉 if it occurs in a sentence which has a real point.</p>
