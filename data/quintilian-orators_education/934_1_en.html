natural breaks between phrases. We must however train our breathing to last as long as possible. For this purpose Demosthenes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_113_36" id="target_note_LCL494_113_36"><sup>36</sup></a> used to recite as many lines as he could without pausing while walking uphill. He also used to roll pebbles under his tongue when practising at home, in order to improve his articulation.</p>
<p>The breath may sometimes be long, full, and clear, but still not held firmly enough, and therefore tremulous—like bodies which look healthy but lack muscle. The Greeks call this <span class="italic">brasmos</span>. <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_113_37" id="target_note_LCL494_113_37"><sup>37</sup></a> Some people do not so much take in breath as suck it in with a hiss through the gaps in their teeth. There are others whose frequent panting and noisy internal wheezing remind one of overloaded draught animals straining under the load and the yoke. They actually do this deliberately, to suggest that they are overwhelmed by the richness of their Invention and that there is a greater head of eloquence developing within them than can find its way out through the throat. With others, the mouth will not open, and they wrestle with their words. As for coughing and spitting frequently, hawking up phlegm from the bottom of the lungs with a rattle like a windlass, sprinkling everyone around you with the moisture of your mouth, and letting out most of your breath through the nose while you are speaking—these are not of course faults <span class="italic">of</span> the voice, but they are <span class="italic">due to</span> the voice, so that this is perhaps the best place to mention them.</p>
<p>Yet all these faults are tolerable compared with the sing-song manner which is the chief problem in every Cause and every school nowadays<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_113_38" id="target_note_LCL494_113_38"><sup>38</sup></a>—and whether it is more useless than disgusting I do not know! What is less
