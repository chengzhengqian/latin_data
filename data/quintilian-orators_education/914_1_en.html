<p>If a longish speech has to be held in the memory, it will be best to learn it section by section (memory suffers most by being overburdened), but these sections should not be too small, or there will be a lot of them, and they will distract and fragment the memory. I do not want to lay down a definite length, but, if possible, the sections should coincide with the ends of topics, unless a topic is so complex that it needs to be subdivided. Some well-defined stopping points should be established, so that the sequence of the words (which is the most difficult thing) is assured by continuous and frequent revision, and the sequence of the parts by the repeated recall of the order. If some things do not stick easily in the mind, it is quite useful to attach some marks to them, the recall of which will warn and jog the memory. No one surely will be so ill-endowed as not to remember what Symbol he has assigned to any given passage. But if a student is slow at this, let him use the further device (which is quite a useful contribution of the Art of Memory!) of suiting his marks to the ideas which he is liable to forget—an anchor, as I suggested, if he has to speak about a ship, or a javelin if it is about a battle. Symbols are very effective, and one memory leads to another—just as a ring put on a different finger or tied with a thread reminds us why we did these things. These Symbols acquire even more binding force when people transfer memory from some similar object to the item which has to be remembered. Take names for example: if we have to remember the name Fabius, let us think of the famous Cunctator,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_73_15" id="target_note_LCL494_73_15"><sup>15</sup></a> whom we cannot possibly forget, or of some personal friend of the same name. This is easier with names like
