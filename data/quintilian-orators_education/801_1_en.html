and sonorous sounds; they like the amplitude of the Dactyl too and the Paean, feet which, even though they have more short syllables than long, have a full complement of time units. Harshness, on the other hand, is best produced by Iambi, not only because these consist of only two syllables, so that their beat is more frequent as it were (a feature quite contrary to smoothness), but also because they have a rising motion at each foot, and climb and swell from short to long; this is why they are preferable to Chorei, which drop from long to short. Subdued passages, such as are found in Epilogues, also call for slow syllables, but with less volume of sound.</p>
<p>Celsus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_237_147a" id="target_note_LCL127_237_147a"><sup>147</sup></a> proposes that there is also a more “supine” type of Composition. If I knew of one, I should not teach it. It must of course be slow and “supine,” but unless the effect is obtained by words and thoughts which are in themselves like this (?), it will not be able to be slack enough.</p>
<p>Finally, to sum all this up, our Composition must generally correspond to our Delivery. Are we not, as a rule, subdued in the Prooemium (unless we need to stir up the judge in a prosecution, or fill him with indignation about something); full and explicit in the Narrative; quick in the Arguments, and rapid even in our body movements; expansive and fluent in Commonplaces and Descriptions; downcast and submissive for the most part in the Epilogue?
