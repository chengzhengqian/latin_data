<p>But this itself depends on the previous question. For if the duties of the <span class="italic">grammaticus</span> are extended to include <span class="italic">suasoriae,</span> the rhetor will not be needed till later. But if the rhetor does not shirk the first duties of his task, he is needed as soon as the pupil gets to Narratives and short Encomia and Vituperations. Have we forgotten that the ancients developed their eloquence by the exercises of Thesis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_267_3" id="target_note_LCL124_267_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and Commonplace,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_267_4" id="target_note_LCL124_267_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and others which do not have a particular context of circumstances and persons, such as form the substance of real and imaginary <span class="italic">controversiae</span>?

And what is there in the exercises of which I have just spoken which does not fall within the general functions of the rhetor, and indeed also within the forensic genre? Do we not have to give Narratives in court? I suspect it may be the most important thing we do there. Are not Encomium and Vituperation frequently introduced in our contests? Do not Commonplaces belong at the very heart of lawsuits, whether they are like those which we read that Cicero composed, against vices, or are general discussions of questions, like those published also by Quintus Hortensius—“should small arguments carry weight?” “for witnesses,” and “against witnesses?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_267_5a" id="target_note_LCL124_267_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> These are, in a sense, weapons always to be kept ready,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_267_6" id="target_note_LCL124_267_6"><sup>6</sup></a> to be</p>
