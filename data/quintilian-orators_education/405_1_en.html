should deny it. This is rather a long passage, and so I have not given it in Cicero’s words. For a brief instance of a Contrary, we may turn to Vergil:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">But Achilles, whom you falsely claim as father,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">was not like this towards his enemy Priam.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_439_20" id="target_note_LCL125_439_20"><sup>20</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Some historical examples may be narrated in full, as Cicero does in <span class="italic">Pro Milone</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_439_21" id="target_note_LCL125_439_21"><sup>21</sup></a> “When a military tribune in Gaius Marius’ army, a relation of the commander, sexually assaulted a soldier, he was killed by the man whom he was assaulting; that virtuous young man preferred the dangers of action to the disgrace of submission.

<span class="label"><span class="italic">Poetic fables</span></span>
<p>The same principle applies to examples drawn from poetic fables, except that these are of less probative force. How they should be used is demonstrated by the same great writer and teacher of eloquence. An Example of this kind in fact will be found in that same speech:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_439_23" id="target_note_LCL125_439_23"><sup>23</sup></a> “It is not without reason therefore, members of the jury, that even in their fictions learned men have recorded that a man who had killed his mother to avenge his father, when the verdicts of the human judges were divided, was freed by a
