Witnesses are confused, and are drawn into traps by the advocates on the other side; they do more damage by being caught like this than they would have done good by a firm and fearless performance.

This will ensure either that they are consistent or at least, if they should stumble, that they are put back on their feet, as it were, by a timely question from the advocate who has produced them. And even with those who have been consistent, we must avoid a possible ambush; for witnesses are often put forward fraudulently by the other side, and, having promised evidence wholly in our favour, give answers of quite an opposite kind, and make themselves felt not as disproving the charge but as admitting it. We must therefore find out what reasons they have for harming our opponent.
