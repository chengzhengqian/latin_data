<p>In answering these people in the first instance in relation to my own work, I shall be satisfying them also as regards the duty of a good man, who may sometimes have reason to undertake the defence of the guilty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_215_24" id="target_note_LCL494_215_24"><sup>24</sup></a> It is not useless to consider how one may on occasion speak for a falsehood or even for an injustice, if only because this enables us to detect and refute such things more easily, just as the person who knows what things are harmful will be better at applying remedies for them. After all, the Academics argue both sides of a question, but live according to one side only, and the great Carneades, who is said to have spoken at Rome in the presence of the censor Cato just as vigorously against justice as he had spoken in defence of justice the day before, was a perfectly just man.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_215_25" id="target_note_LCL494_215_25"><sup>25</sup></a> In fact, what virtue is is revealed by its opposite, vice; equity is better understood by looking at its opposite; and in general most things are shown to be good by comparison with their contraries. The orator therefore must know his adversaries’ plans as the general does the enemy’s.</p>
<p>However—hard as this seems when it is first stated—rational consideration may also lead a good man, in his defence of his Cause, occasionally to want to cheat the judge of the truth. If anyone is surprised at my saying this (though it is not my own idea, but comes from persons whom antiquity regarded as authoritative philosophers),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_215_26" id="target_note_LCL494_215_26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
