<p>Some things indeed cannot be taught by art. Suppose the case of a noun is to be changed, if the case we started with sounds unduly harsh: where are the rules to tell us which to change to which? A change of Figure—both of Speech and of Thought—often comes to the rescue of a troubled piece of Composition. Are there any rules for this? We must seize opportunities, and look to the immediate situation for advice. And as for the intervals, which are so very important in all this, how can they be judged except by the ear? Why are some sentences complete, even too full, though there are fewer words, while others, with more words, seem brief and cut short? Why does there seem to be some empty space in periods, even when the sense is complete? “Members of the jury, I am sure none of you is unaware that, throughout these (<span class="italic">hosce</span>) days, this has been the common talk, this the opinion of the Roman people.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_227_130" id="target_note_LCL127_227_130"><sup>130</sup></a> Why <span class="italic">hosce</span> rather than <span class="italic">hos?</span> There would have been no roughness in <span class="italic">hos.</span> Perhaps I shall not be able to give a reason, but I shall feel it is better. And why was it not good enough to mention only “the common talk”? Composition raised no problem. I shall admit ignorance, but, as I hear these words, my mind accepts that the sentence is incomplete without this duplication. We have to refer these things to our senses. They will understand well enough what is strong, severe, or agreeable; they will do better with nature to guide them than with art; but there will be art inherent in nature.</p>
