<p>A litigant who declines to accept an oath when offered will say that many people also shrug off the terrors of an oath (we even find philosophers who deny that the gods care about human affairs),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_335_1" id="target_note_LCL125_335_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but a man who is ready to take an oath without being asked to do so is trying to give judgement in his own Cause and show how trivial and easy a thing it is that he is offering. On the other hand, the man who puts his opponent on oath is thought to be acting modestly in making his opponent the judge of the dispute, and also frees the person who hears the case from a burden, since he would surely prefer the decision to rest on another man’s oath than on his own. This makes refusal to take an oath all the more difficult, unless the affair is such that one can be believed not to have knowledge of it. Failing this excuse, the only course left is to say that one’s opponent is trying to stir up bad feeling and that his object is to have ground for complaint in a Cause which he cannot win; consequently (one may say) a dishonest man would have snatched at this proposal, but “I prefer to prove my statements rather than leave a doubt in anyone’s mind as to whether I have committed perjury.”</p>
<p>When I was young, however, the old hands at pleading used to advise us never to ask an opponent to take an oath, just as one would never give him the choice of a judge, or select a judge from among the advocates on the opposite side; for (they would say), if it was thought a disgrace for a lawyer to say anything damaging to his client, it must be even more disgraceful to do something to harm him.</p>
