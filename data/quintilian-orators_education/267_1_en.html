<p>cannot rest in the same point as the Question, and Cicero says as much in his <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> and in his <span class="italic">Partitiones.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_163_6" id="target_note_LCL125_163_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Now in Conjecture, the Question arising out of “Done, not done” is whether it was done. So the Point for Decision is on the same point as the Question, because the first Question and the final decision relate to the same matter. In Quality, on the other hand—“Orestes killed his mother: justifiably, not justifiably”—the Question is whether he killed her justifiably, but this is not as yet the Point for Decision. So when does that come? “She had killed my father.” “But that does not mean you ought to have killed your mother.” Ought he? That is where the Point for Decision lies. As to the Core, I will quote Cicero himself: “Suppose Orestes chooses to say that his mother’s attitude to his father, himself, his sister, the kingdom, and the reputation of their race and their family is such that it is the overriding duty of the children to exact punishment from her.” Others also use examples like the following: “A man who has exhausted his patrimony is not allowed to address the people. This man has exhausted his patrimony on public works.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_163_7" id="target_note_LCL125_163_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Here the Question is whether everyone who exhausts his means is so debarred; the Point for Decision is whether this holds of a man who exhausted his means in this particular way. Or take the case of the soldier Arruntius who killed the tribune Lusius for attempting to abuse him sexually.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_163_8" id="target_note_LCL125_163_8"><sup>8</sup></a> The Question is whether he acted justifiably. The Line of Defence is that the tribune tried to abuse him. The Point for Decision is whether it was right for a man to be killed uncondemned, or for a tribune to be killed by a soldier.</p>
<p>Some actually think that a Question can involve one Issue, when the Point for Decision involves another.
