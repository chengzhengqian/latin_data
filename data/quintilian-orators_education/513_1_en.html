temporary joys of a vain hope. It is therefore well to conceal some of the documents available to us. Opponents often press for these, stake everything on something they believe we do not have, and lend weight to our proofs by their very insistence on our producing them. It is good policy also to give the opponent something which he can think is to his advantage, in grasping which he may be forced to let go something more significant; or again, sometimes, to give him a choice of two alternatives, either of which will be a bad choice for him. This is more effective in the Altercation than in the set speech, because in the latter we answer ourselves, but here we have our opponent, as it were, held fast by his own confession.</p>
<p>It takes a very sharp mind to see what remarks will impress the judge, and what he will reject; this is often discernible from his face and occasionally also from something he says or does. We should both press home points which help, and retreat as quietly as possible from those which do not. Doctors too do this; they either continue with a treatment or stop it, according to whether they see it accepted or rejected.</p>

Practising Altercation, however, is much easier. It is very useful to make a frequent habit of cooperating
