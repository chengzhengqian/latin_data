<p>as Myron’s famous Discobolus?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_345_5" id="target_note_LCL124_345_5"><sup>5</sup></a> But would not any critic who disapproved of it because it was not upright show how far he was from understanding its art, in which the very novelty and difficulty of the pose are what most deserve praise?</p>
<p>The same grace and charm are produced by Figures, whether of Thought or of Speech. They represent a deviation from the norm, and make a virtue of their distance from common or vulgar usage. In a picture, the full face displays the beauty; yet Apelles painted Antigonus in profile, so as to conceal the blemish of his lost eye.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_345_6" id="target_note_LCL124_345_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Are not certain things likewise to be covered up in a speech, either because they ought not to be disclosed or because they cannot be expressed adequately? This is what Timanthes of Cythnus (I think it was he) did in the picture with which he won the prize over Colotes of Teos.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_345_7" id="target_note_LCL124_345_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Having depicted, in his Sacrifice of Iphigenia, Calchas sad, Ulysses even sadder, and given Menelaus the most complete expression of grief that his art could produce, he found he had used up all his means of representing emotion and could discover no way of adequately portraying her father’s face; so he covered his head in a veil, and left it to the imagination of the spectators. There is a parallel to this, surely, in Sallust’s words: “As to Carthage, I think it better to say nothing than to say too little.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_345_8" id="target_note_LCL124_345_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Because of this, it has always been my custom to tie myself down as little as possible to what the Greeks call “catholic”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_345_9" id="target_note_LCL124_345_9"><sup>9</sup></a> rules—that is (to translate as well as we can)</p>
