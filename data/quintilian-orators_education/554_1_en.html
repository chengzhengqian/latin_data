not, I shall separate them. (However, in case anyone thinks I have been careless in letting slip the remark that adultery is “generally”—not “always”—a crime of two persons, let me point out that a woman alone may be accused of adultery with an unknown man: “presents were found in the house; money from an unknown source; letters to an unknown person.”) Similarly with forgery: there are either several accused or only one, and the writer of the document always finds it necessary to support the signatory, but the signatory does not always support the writer, because he may in fact have been deceived. On the other hand, the man who is said to have called them in, and for whom the thing is said to have been done, will defend both the writer and the signatories. The same Topics of Argument apply in cases of treachery and attempted tyranny.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_215_37" id="target_note_LCL126_215_37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>The school custom of regarding everything not stated in the “theme” as favourable to one’s own case can be damaging to future practitioners in the courts. You bring a charge of adultery: “Who is the witness? Who is the informer?” &lt;Of treachery&gt;: “What was the reward? Who was my accomplice?” Of poisoning: “Where did I buy it? From whom? When? For how much? Whom did I get to give the dose?” For the defence in a charge of attempted tyranny: “Where are the arms? What bodyguards have I hired?” I do not say that students should not say these things themselves, or not use them on behalf of the side they have taken. And even in court I shall make some such demands when my opponent is unable to prove his point. In court, however, I should not wish demands to be made so readily, for there we hardly find a case in which one or more of those facts are not given us. Similar to this is the practice
