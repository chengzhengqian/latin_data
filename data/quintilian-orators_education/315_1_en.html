facts which can be minimized, and, to achieve this, must at any rate be stated? To put it another way, what is the difference between Proof and Narrative, except that the Narrative is a preliminary statement of the Proof given at length, and the Proof is a confirmation which conforms to the Narrative? Let us consider therefore whether this statement needs now to be longer and somewhat wordier than usual, because it includes the preparatory remarks and some Arguments (Arguments, be it noted, not Argumentation!);<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_259_53" id="target_note_LCL125_259_53"><sup>53</sup></a> what will help it most, however, is a frequent repetition of the assurance that we shall make good what we say later on: “The force of the facts cannot be brought out at the first telling of them; wait, keep your minds open, and have confidence.”</p>
<p>In any case, we must certainly include in the Narrative anything which can be treated in a different way from that in which it was treated by the opponent; otherwise, one would have to say that in these Causes there is no need for Prooemia either, for what can they do except make the judge better prepared to understand the facts? Yet it will be agreed that they are never more useful than when his mind has to be diverted from a prejudice which he has formed against us.</p>
<p>Conjectural Causes, in which the question is one of fact, more often have a Narrative of the circumstances from which the fact may be inferred than of the actual fact itself which is before the court.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_259_54" id="target_note_LCL125_259_54"><sup>54</sup></a> Since the accuser relates these circumstances so as to arouse suspicions, and the defendant has to dispel these suspicions, defendant and accuser have to bring the facts to the judge’s notice in different ways.</p>
