even if he were not Master of the Horse. Another writer might have split this up and lingered over each step; Cicero has gone full speed for his climax, and reached the top, not by effort, but by sheer <span class="italic">élan.</span></p>
<p>(2) While this form of Amplification rises ever higher and higher, the form based on Comparison aims at Increment by starting lower down the scale: by exaggerating the lower stage it cannot help raising the level of the higher. So Cicero in the passage already quoted: “If this had happened to you at dinner or in the middle of your monstrous potations, who would not think it disgraceful? But it happened in an assembly of the people of Rome . . .” Or again, from <span class="italic">In Catilinam</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_397_6" id="target_note_LCL126_397_6"><sup>6</sup></a> “If my slaves feared me as all your fellow-citizens fear you, I should think I ought to leave my house.” Sometimes to suggest a parallel example enables us to make something which we want to exaggerate even greater, as Cicero again does in <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_397_7" id="target_note_LCL126_397_7"><sup>7</sup></a> where, after telling how a woman from Miletus took a bribe from the reversionary heirs to have an abortion, he goes on: “How much greater is the punishment Oppianicus deserves for the same offence? That woman, by doing violence to her own body, tortured herself; he has brought about the same outcome by the violence and torture suffered by another person.” Let no one think that this is the same as the topic of Argument<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_397_8" id="target_note_LCL126_397_8"><sup>8</sup></a> in which the greater is inferred from the less, though there is indeed a similarity. For in that case we are aiming at Proof, here at Amplification. Thus, in the passage about Oppianicus, the object is not to show that he did a bad thing, but that he did something worse than the other person.</p>
<p>But, different as these procedures are, there is an affinity between them. I will therefore repeat here also the
