a discharge with ignominy to an officer, who kept saying, in the course of a plea for mercy, “What shall I tell my father?” “Tell him I failed to please you,” was the answer. This is different from Gabba’s remark to the man who asked for his rain-cloak, “I can’t lend it to you, I am staying at home,” the point being that the rain was pouring through the roof of his garret. There is yet a third kind (my respect for the author prevents me from naming him): “You are more lustful than any eunuch” is certainly also a “disappointment of expectation”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_97_64" id="target_note_LCL126_97_64"><sup>64</sup></a> but it depends on a Contrary. Under the same heading, though quite different from all the above, is the remark of Marcus Vestinus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_97_65" id="target_note_LCL126_97_65"><sup>65</sup></a> when he was told . . .”Some day he will cease to stink.” But I shall overload this book with examples, and make it like those which are written simply to amuse, if I choose to record the witticisms of the ancients individually.</p>

<p>Similarly, jests may take the form of any Trope. (1) Do not many take the form of &lt;Hyperbole&gt;, like Cicero’s remark about the very tall man: “He hit his head on the Arch
