Very comparable to these performers, I feel, are the people who spend their lives, with much study and effort, on declamations which they design to be as unreal as possible. The rhetoric which I am trying to establish, and of which I have formed an idea in my mind, the rhetoric which befits a good man and really <span class="italic">is</span> rhetoric, will be a virtue. Philosophers come to this conclusion by many ingenious arguments; to me it seems perfectly clear from the simpler and original proof which I give below.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_403_5" id="target_note_LCL124_403_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>This is what the philosophers say. If consistency in what should and should not be done is a virtue (the part of virtue called prudence), the same virtue should appear in respect of what should and should not be said. Furthermore, if there are virtues of which nature has granted us some rudiments or seeds even before we are taught—justice for instance, some semblance of which is evident to countryfolk and barbarians—it is plain that we have been formed from
