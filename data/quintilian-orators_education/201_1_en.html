<p>Whether there are three or more of these is disputed. Of course, almost all the writers who are most authoritative among the ancients followed Aristotle, who merely changes one name and says “demegoric”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_31_1" id="target_note_LCL125_31_1"><sup>1</sup></a> instead of “deliberative,” and were happy with this division. However, even in those days some slight attempt was made among certain Greeks (and also in Cicero’s <span class="italic">De oratore</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_31_2" id="target_note_LCL125_31_2"><sup>2</sup></a>), and an almost overwhelming argument has been advanced by the greatest authority of our own day,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_31_3" id="target_note_LCL125_31_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to prove that there are not only more than three such kinds, but that they are almost innumerable. Indeed, if we place the function of praise and blame in the third part, on what “kind” are we to think ourselves engaged when we complain, console, pacify, excite, frighten, encourage, instruct, explain obscurities, narrate, plead for mercy, give thanks, congratulate, reproach, abuse, describe, command, renounce, wish, opine, and so on and so forth? Adhering to the old view as I do, I have therefore to ask for indulgence, and inquire what motive can have induced earlier writers to confine such a broad field within such narrow bounds. Those who think they were wrong believe that the reason was that these were the areas in which they saw orators active in those days: encomia and denunciations were being written, it was the custom to pronounce funeral orations,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_31_4" id="target_note_LCL125_31_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and most effort was being lavished on deliberative and forensic themes, so that the textbook writers covered the commonest kinds as if they were the only ones. On the other hand, the defenders of the old view make three classes of audience:
