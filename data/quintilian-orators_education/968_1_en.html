<p>fathers and good slaves, married ladies, and respectable old women; the other did better with angry old men, shifty slaves, parasites, pimps, and all the livelier characters. Their natural gifts in fact differed. Demetrius had the pleasanter voice, Stratocles the more penetrating. Even more noteworthy were the peculiar, and nontransferable, features of each. The hand-waving, the lovely long cries meant for the audience, the way of catching the wind in his clothes as he came on, the occasional expressive movement of his right side—all this became Demetrius, and no one else; his height and his good looks helped him in it all. What became Stratocles, on the other hand, was his speed and agility, his laugh (not always in keeping with the character, but a conscious concession to the audience), and even his hunched-up neck. If the other had done any of these things, it would have seemed a disgusting performance. So let everyone “know himself,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_181_143" id="target_note_LCL494_181_143"><sup>143</sup></a> and take counsel in forming his Delivery not only from general rules, but from his own nature. Not that there is anything fundamentally wrong in a man’s finding everything, or at least most things, appropriate for him to do.</p>
<p>The conclusion of this discussion must be the same as that of all the others: moderation rules. I do not want my pupil to be a comic actor, but an orator. We shall not therefore pursue all the refinements of Gesture, nor shall we be pedantic about punctuation, timing, or emotional tone in speaking. Suppose one had to say the following lines on the stage:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">So what shall I do? Not go, not even now</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">when I am sent for? Or, rather, steel myself</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">not to put up with insults from these harlots?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_181_144" id="target_note_LCL494_181_144"><sup>144</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
