<p>Those who think that all Questions are concerned with either things or words share the same view.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">“Indefinite” and “Definite” Questions</span></span>
<p>It is also agreed that Questions are either Indefinite or Definite. Indefinite Questions are those which may be argued both ways without reference to persons, times, places, and the like. The Greeks call these <span class="italic">theses,</span> Cicero “propositions,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_41_8" id="target_note_LCL125_41_8"><sup>8</sup></a> others “general public Questions,” or “Questions suitable for a philosopher”; Athenaeus calls them “parts of the Cause.”</p>
<p>Cicero divides this type into two, one part concerned with knowledge, the other with action.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_41_9" id="target_note_LCL125_41_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Thus “Is the world governed by providence?” is a Question of knowledge, while “Should one engage in public life?” is one of action. The first of these involves three points—is it? what is it? what sort of thing is it?—all of which may be unknown. The second involves only two—how should we obtain office, and how should we use our power?</p>
<p>Definite Questions arise from a combination of facts, persons, times, and so on. The Greeks call these <span class="italic">hypotheses;</span> in Latin we call them <span class="italic">causae.</span> In these, the entire Question seems to be based on the facts and the persons. An Indefinite Question is always wider, for the Definite Question derives from it. Let me illustrate this by an example. “Should one take a wife?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_41_10" id="target_note_LCL125_41_10"><sup>10</sup></a> is indefinite: “Should Cato take a wife?” is definite, and so can form a <span class="italic">suasoria.</span> Even Questions which have no connection with particular persons are normally given some specific reference. “Ought one to take part in government?” is simple; “Ought one to take part in government under a tyranny?” has a specific refer­ence.
