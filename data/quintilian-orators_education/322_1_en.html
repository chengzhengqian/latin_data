<p>How could she not have feared, if not the vengeance of heaven and the judgement of men, then at least the coming of that night, the bridal torches, the bedroom door, her daughter’s room, the very walls that had witnessed her former marriage!”</p>
<p>As to Apostrophe, it sometimes shortens a statement or proves it more cogently, and my view of this is the same as I expressed in connection with the Prooemium.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_273_67" id="target_note_LCL125_273_67"><sup>67</sup></a> The same applies to Prosopopoeia, which was used however not only by Servius Sulpicius in his defence of Aufidia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_273_68" id="target_note_LCL125_273_68"><sup>68</sup></a> (“Am I to think you were drowsy with sleep or weighed down by some heavy lethargy?”) but also by Cicero in the passage about the ships’ captains<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_273_69" id="target_note_LCL125_273_69"><sup>69</sup></a> (for this too is a Narrative), where he says “To be admitted, you must give so much . . .” and so on. Again, in the <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_273_70" id="target_note_LCL125_273_70"><sup>70</sup></a> does not the conversation between Staienus and Bulbus contribute very greatly both to the speed and to the credibility of the Narrative? Lest it should be thought that Cicero did this through inadvertence of some kind (though in him that is unbelievable), observe that he recommends in the <span class="italic">Partitions</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_273_71" id="target_note_LCL125_273_71"><sup>71</sup></a> that a Narrative should possess passages which charm, surprise, and rouse expectations, as well as unexpected turns, conversations between persons, and all kinds of emotions.</p>
<p>Argumentation in Narrative, as I said, we shall never use; Argument we shall sometimes, as Cicero does in the <span class="italic">Pro Ligario</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_273_72" id="target_note_LCL125_273_72"><sup>72</sup></a> when he says that his client ruled the province in such a way that peace was in his interest. We shall also insert a brief defence and reasoned account of events in a Narrative when the situation demands, for one should not be telling the story as a witness but as an advocate. The order of facts runs: “Quintus Ligarius went out as legate to
