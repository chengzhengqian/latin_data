The point to be discovered, to enable this Argument to be applied, is that, if captives have returned to their own country, they are free precisely because what was acquired by war can only be retained by the same force. Another peculiarity of the Cause is that the judges are the Amphictyones. (Compare the way in which the same Questions will require different treatment in the centumviral courts and before a private judge.)

Discovering this line is more difficult than supporting it, once it is discovered, with Arguments—for example, that the position of an heir and that of a conqueror may be different, because the <span class="italic">right</span> passes to the heir, and only the actual <span class="italic">object</span> to the conqueror.
