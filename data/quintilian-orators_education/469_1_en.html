when the Question is one of the Quality of something, Emotion is justifiably combined with the Proofs of each fact. When we are pleading a Cause which is a complex of several Causes, it will be necessary also to have several quasi-epilogues, as Cicero does in the Verrines,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_45_34" id="target_note_LCL126_45_34"><sup>34</sup></a> where he sheds tears over Philodamus, the ship’s captains, the crucified Roman citizen and many other victims. Some call these <span class="italic">merikoi epilogoi,</span> meaning a “divided peroration.” I think they are not so much parts of the Peroration as distinct species, because the terms “Peroration” and “Epilogue” themselves plainly indicate that this is the final conclusion of the speech.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">More on emotions</span></span>
<p>Although this final part of forensic causes consists mainly in emotional appeals, and I have been obliged to say something about these, I did not find it possible, or indeed right, to bring the whole topic of emotions together under this single head. Thus we have still before us a subject which both offers the most powerful means of securing our aims, and is much more difficult than anything we have discussed above: I mean the business of affecting the judges’ minds, shaping them to our wishes, and, one might say, transfiguring them. I have touched on the few aspects of this subject which my material made necessary, more to show what ought to be done than to show how it could be attained. I must now go into the theory of the whole thing more deeply.</p>
<p>There is scope for the emotions, as I said, throughout
