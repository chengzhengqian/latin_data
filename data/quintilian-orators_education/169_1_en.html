prepared to admit that rhetoric does sometimes say untrue things as if true, but I would not concede that it is therefore in a state of false opinion; there is a great difference between holding an opinion oneself and making someone else adopt it. Generals also often use falsehoods: Hannibal, when hemmed in by Fabius, gave the enemy the illusion that his army was in retreat by tying brushwood to the horns of oxen, setting fire to them, and driving the herd at night up into the mountains.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_387_17" id="target_note_LCL124_387_17"><sup>17</sup></a> He deceived Fabius, but he knew the truth himself. Again, when the Spartan Theopompus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_387_18" id="target_note_LCL124_387_18"><sup>18</sup></a> changed clothes with his wife and escaped from custody disguised as a woman, he had no false opinion about himself, but he gave his guards one. Similarly an orator, when he substitutes a falsehood for the truth, knows it is false and that he is substituting it for the truth; he does not therefore have a false opinion himself, but he deceives the other person. When Cicero boasted<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_387_19" id="target_note_LCL124_387_19"><sup>19</sup></a> that he had cast a cloud of darkness over the eyes of the jury, in the case of Cluentius, he saw clearly enough himself. And when a painter makes us believe, by his art, that some objects are in the foreground and others in the background, he himself knows they are all on the same plane.</p>
<p>(3) They also say that all arts have a definite end to which they are directed, but in rhetoric sometimes there is no such thing, and sometimes the promised end is not achieved. This is false. We have already shown that there is an end, and what it is.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_387_20" id="target_note_LCL124_387_20"><sup>20</sup></a> Moreover, the real orator will always achieve it, because he will always speak well. However, this criticism may perhaps be valid against those who think that the “end” is to persuade. My orator, and the art that I have defined, do not depend on the outcome. The speaker certainly aims to win; but when he has spoken
