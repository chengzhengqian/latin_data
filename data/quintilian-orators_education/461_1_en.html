<p>Judges sometimes have also to be instructed as to what answer they should make to particular questions; this is itself one form of Recapitulation.</p>
<p>As for the defendant, he gets credit from his standing, his bravery, his battle scars, his birth, and the services of his ancestors. Cicero and Asinius competed on this last-mentioned theme,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_29_16" id="target_note_LCL126_29_16"><sup>16</sup></a> Cicero defending the elder Scaurus, Asinius the son.

Public advantage, the reputation of the judges, the power of precedent, and the judgement of posterity are also relevant in this connection. But what carries most weight is the appeal to pity, which obliges the judge not only to be moved, but to reveal his own feelings by his tears. Such appeals will be based either on what the accused has suffered, or what he is suffering at the moment, or on what awaits him if he is convicted. The effect of this is doubled when we contrast his former situation with that to which he must now be reduced.
