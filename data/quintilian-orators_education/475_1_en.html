most work to do, because some things are seen to be grave in themselves—parricide, murder, poisoning—whereas others have to be made out to be so. This happens: (1) when we show that what we have suffered is worse than things which are anyway great evils; thus Vergil:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">O blest beyond all others, Priam’s maiden,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">upon an enemy’s tomb, by Troy’s high walls,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">bidden to die,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_57_6" id="target_note_LCL126_57_6"><sup>6</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">for how grievous must Andromache’s lot be if Polyxena is happy compared with her! (2) when we endeavour to exaggerate our wrongs by saying that other far lesser troubles are intolerable: “If you had so much as hit him, it could not have been justified; but you wounded him.” I shall discuss this in more detail when I speak of Amplification.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_57_7" id="target_note_LCL126_57_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, I content myself with observing that the aim of appeals to the emotions is not only to display the bitter and melancholy nature of troubles that indeed are so, but also to make experiences which are commonly thought tolerable seem grievous: for instance, when we say that there is more injury done by an insult than by a blow, or that disgrace is a heavier penalty than death. The power of eloquence in fact lies not only in driving the judge to the conclusion towards which he will be led by the nature of the facts, but either in arousing emotion which is not there or in making an existing emotion more intense. This is called <span class="italic">deinōsis,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_57_8" id="target_note_LCL126_57_8"><sup>8</sup></a> that is to say language that adds force to facts which are disgraceful, cruel, or odious. Demosthenes was even stronger in this quality than in others.</p>
<p>If I felt it was sufficient to follow traditional rules, I should have done enough for this topic if I simply left out nothing that I had read or learnt, so long as it was sound
