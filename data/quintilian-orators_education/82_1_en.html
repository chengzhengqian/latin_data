<p>action: “When Crates<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_213_7" id="target_note_LCL124_213_7"><sup>7</sup></a> saw an ill-educated boy, he beat his <span class="italic">paedagogus.</span>” A very similar example—which they do not venture to call a Chria but say it is “of the Chria type”—is “Milo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_213_8" id="target_note_LCL124_213_8"><sup>8</sup></a> carried a grown bull which he had been used to carry as a calf.” All these can be declined through the same range of cases,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_213_9" id="target_note_LCL124_213_9"><sup>9</sup></a> and the principle applies to Chriae based on actions as well as those based on words.</p>
<p>Short narratives found in the poets should, in my view, be taught for general knowledge, not for developing eloquence. Larger and more ambitious exercises<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_213_10" id="target_note_LCL124_213_10"><sup>10</sup></a> have been forced on the <span class="italic">grammatici</span> by Latin rhetors who have abandoned them; the Greeks know the burdens and the limits of their work better.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">What other arts should the orator learn?</span></span>
<p class="noindent">I have been as concise as possible in this discussion of <span class="italic">grammaticē,</span> making no attempt to mention everything (that would have been an endless task) but selecting the most essential points. I shall now briefly add something about the other arts in which I think boys should be trained before they are passed on to the rhetor, so as to complete the course of learning which the Greeks call <span class="italic">enkyklios paideia.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_213_1a" id="target_note_LCL124_213_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
