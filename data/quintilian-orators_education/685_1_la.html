20–26; Lausberg § 779). More emotional are exclamations and outbursts of frankness (26–29; Lausberg § 761, § 809); bolder still, Prosopopoeia (29–37; Lausberg §§ 826–829), Apostrophe (38–39; Lausberg §§ 762–765), and various kinds of “vividness,” which aim to make the events come alive, as if seen happening at the present moment (40–44; Lausberg §§ 810–819).</p>
<p>Next comes the <span class="italic">Figure</span> Irony (44–51; Lausberg §§ 902–904), to be distinguished from the Trope of the same name by being longer and less self-explanatory. Related to it (51–53) are various kinds of simulated attitudes: confessions, agreements, praise, exaggeration, all insincere. Aposiopesis (54–57; Lausberg § 887) is another way of enhancing emotion, whereas <span class="italic">ēthopoeia</span> (58; Lausberg § 820), the vivid description of persons and characteristic traits, belongs rather to the less emotive range of Figures. So do the reporting of one’s own words or actions (59), pretended recantations or fits of forgetfulness, and various kinds of appeal to the judges (59–63). Emphasis too(64–66; Lausberg § 906) can be a Figure as well as a Trope, namely when a sentence conceals a meaning which is not obvious from the words, but has to be discovered by the hearer. This is the principle behind the “figured” themes of the declaimers, in which the speaker is supposed to aim at an object different from that which he openly avers. (The principal theoretical text on these is [Dionysius of Halicarnassus], <span class="italic">Ars rhetorica</span> 8–9 (2. 295–358 Usener–Radermacher), which contains important material bearing on the interpretation of literature in the rhetorical schools; for other relevant texts, see note on 9.2.65.) Quintilian now proceeds to discuss “figured” themes at length (65–99). He adds (100–101) a footnote on Comparison (see Lausberg § 799), and a
