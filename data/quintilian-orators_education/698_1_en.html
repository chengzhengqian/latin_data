<p>Most of this is repeated in the <span class="italic">Orator,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_31_80" id="target_note_LCL127_31_80"><sup>80</sup></a> but not all, and somewhat more clearly, because after the Figures of Speech and Thought he adds a third section concerned, as he says, with the other “virtues” of speech:</p>
<p>“The other highlights, as it were, which are based on word arrangement supply important decoration to oratory. They are like what, in the rich ornamentation of the stage or the forum, are called ‘special features,’ not because they are the only form of ornament there, but because they are the outstanding form. The highlights and ‘special features’ of oratory work in the same way. Words are doubled or repeated, or given in a slightly changed form.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_31_81" id="target_note_LCL127_31_81"><sup>81</sup></a> The sentences often begin or end (or both) with the same word; the same word is repeated at the beginning of a clause or at the end; a word is used immediately in a different sense; words have similar terminations or endings; contraries respond to contraries in many ways; the sentence rises and falls step by step; conjunctions are removed and several sentences are unconnected; we pass over something and point out why we do so; we correct and as it were criticize ourselves; there are exclamations of surprise or complaint; we ring the changes on the cases of the same noun.</p>
<p>“But the ornaments of thought are more important. Some people think the merits of Demosthenes’ oratory are due to his frequent use of these.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_31_82" id="target_note_LCL127_31_82"><sup>82</sup></a> Indeed, he hardly has a passage in which the thought is not figured in some fashion.
