that work would have been better done by someone else? Or that an orator will not know how to conduct an ordinary conversation? Or that a great doctor will not be able to treat minor illnesses?</p>
<p>What then? Is there not a type of eloquence too great to be understood by immature boys? I admit that there is. But our eloquent teacher will also need to be sensible and knowledgeable about teaching, and prepared to come down to his pupil’s level, just as a very fast walker, if he were walking with a child, would give him his hand, shorten his own stride, and never go beyond what his companion could manage. Again, it commonly happens that what the most learned teachers say is also easier to understand and much clearer. For clarity is the first virtue of eloquence, and the less talented a speaker is, the harder he will strive after elevation and expansion, just as little men walk on tiptoe and weak men use more threats.

Some may interpret this as implying that the position I am now defending is contrary to my earlier one. But that is far from my intention; perhaps the strongest reason why the boy should be entrusted to the best possible teacher is that the pupils are better
