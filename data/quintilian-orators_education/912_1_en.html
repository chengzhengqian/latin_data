done, when they have to revive the memory, they begin to go over these Sites from the beginning, calling in whatever they deposited with each of them, as the images remind them. Thus, however many things have to be remembered, they become a single item, held together as it were by a sort of outer shell,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_69_10" id="target_note_LCL494_69_10"><sup>10</sup></a> so that speakers do not make mistakes (?) by trying to connect what follows with what goes before by the sole effort of learning by heart.</p>
<p>What I said about a house can be done also with public buildings, a long road, a town perambulation, or pictures. One can even invent these settings for oneself.</p>
<p>So one needs (1) Sites, which may be invented or taken from reality, (2) Images or Symbols, which we must of course invent. By Images I mean the aids we use to mark what we have to learn by heart; as Cicero says,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_69_11" id="target_note_LCL494_69_11"><sup>11</sup></a> we use the Sites as our wax tablet, the Symbols as our letters. It may be best to quote him verbatim: “The Sites we adopt should be numerous, well lit, clearly defined, and at moderate intervals; the Images effective, sharp, distinctive, and such as can come to mind and make a quick impression.” This makes me wonder all the more how Metrodorus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_69_12" id="target_note_LCL494_69_12"><sup>12</sup></a> found 360 Sites in the twelve Signs of the Zodiac. No doubt this was vanity and ostentation in a man who, where memory was concerned, took more pride in his art than in his natural powers.</p>
