<p>Of the same type, and perhaps worst of all, are instances where a verbal ambiguity is combined with some unreal likeness. As a young man I heard a famous pleader, simply for the benefit of his <span class="italic">sententia,</span> hand a mother some splinters of bone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_419_35" id="target_note_LCL126_419_35"><sup>35</sup></a> taken from her son’s head, and say “Unhappy woman, you have not yet given your son a funeral, and yet you have gathered up his bones.”</p>
<p>Again, many delight in farcical conceits, which when seriously considered are ridiculous, though inventing them gives a flattering sense of genius. Remember what is said of the character in the school exercise, who hanged himself after being first ruined by the barrenness of his land and then shipwrecked: “Neither land nor sea accepts him, let him hang in air.” Rather like this is the remark about the man I mentioned above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_419_36" id="target_note_LCL126_419_36"><sup>36</sup></a> whose father gave him poison when he tore his limbs with his teeth: “If he eats that, he should drink this.” Or again, take the case of the glutton who is said to have pretended to starve himself to death:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_419_37" id="target_note_LCL126_419_37"><sup>37</sup></a> “Tie a noose; you have good reason to be angry with your throat. Take poison, it is fitting that a glutton should die by drinking.” Other examples are merely pointless, like the words of the speaker who advises Alexander’s courtiers to bury the king by burning Babylon:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_419_38" id="target_note_LCL126_419_38"><sup>38</sup></a> “This is Alexander I am burying: shall anyone watch this from a rooftop?”—as though that was the worst aspect of the
