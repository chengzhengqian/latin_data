<p>because (a) he lied, (b) he fulfilled none of his instructions, (c) he wasted time, and (d) he took bribes; (3) a rebuttal also sometimes comprises several Propositions, as in this answer to a claim for money: “Your claim is invalid, for you had no right to act as agent,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_297_7" id="target_note_LCL125_297_7"><sup>7</sup></a> nor had the person on whose behalf you are litigating the right to have an agent; nor is he the heir of the man from whom I am said to have had the loan; nor again did I owe him the money.” These examples can be multiplied at will; it is enough to illustrate what is meant. If these Propositions are put forward one at a time, with the Proofs following, there are several Propositions; if they are massed together, it amounts to a Partition.</p>
