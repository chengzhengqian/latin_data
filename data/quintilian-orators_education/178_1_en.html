the beginning to be able to plead for ourselves, not perfectly of course, but well enough to show that (as I said) there are some seeds of this faculty in us. This natural foundation, however, does not exist in arts which have no relation to virtue. Consequently, as there are two kinds of speech, the extended, called rhetoric, and the concise, called dialectic (Zeno<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_405_6" id="target_note_LCL124_405_6"><sup>6</sup></a> described the relationship between them by saying that one was like the closed fist, and the other like the open hand), the art of disputation too will be a virtue. That means there will be even less doubt about rhetoric, which is so much more splendid and transparent.</p>
<p>I should like however to look at this matter more fully and more explicitly by considering the actual work of the orator. For what will he do in an encomium, unless he understands honour and shame? How can he urge a policy unless he has a grasp of expediency? How can he plead in the law courts if he knows nothing about justice? Again, does not oratory call also for courage, since we often have to speak in the face of threats of public disorder, often at the risk of offending the powerful, and sometimes even, as in the trial of Milo, with armed soldiers all around? So, if it is not virtue, oratory cannot even be complete.</p>
<p>But if the virtue of any animal lies in that in which it surpasses all or most other animals—for example, courage in the lion, or swiftness in the horse—and if it is absolutely certain that man excels other animals in reason and speech, why should we not accept that human virtue lies in eloquence just as much as in reason? Crassus in Cicero will then be quite right to say “Eloquence is one of the highest virtues,” and Cicero himself to call it a “virtue,” in his letters to Brutus and in other passages.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_405_7" id="target_note_LCL124_405_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
