for either party. Our own ambiguous words, however, often damage us, as in the following <span class="italic">controversia:</span> “A son was asked where his father was, and replied, ‘Wherever he is, he is drinking’:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_213_36" id="target_note_LCL126_213_36"><sup>36</sup></a> and the father was found dead in a well.” Ambiguous words of others can never do us harm, unless the speaker is either unknown or dead: “A voice was heard in the night, crying, ‘Beware of tyranny’”; or “When asked by whose poison he was dying, he replied ‘It is better for you not to know.’” If there is anyone who can be asked, he will clear up the ambiguity! Although our own words and actions can be defended only by intention, those of others can be disposed of in various ways.</p>

Thus in cases relating to theft, deposits, and loans, Arguments come both from opportunity (was there any money to deposit?) and from persons (can we believe that anyone deposited money with this man or lent to him, or that the claimant is making a false accusation, or that the defendant denies his obligation, or is a thief?).

The line to be taken about this will depend on the Cause: if one party can help the other, I shall put them together; if
