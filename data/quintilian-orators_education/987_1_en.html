who is defending a bad Cause in court? Again, suppose a judge is set to condemn some actions which were rightly done, unless we can convince him that they never were done: will not the orator use even this means to preserve a citizen who is not only innocent but praiseworthy? Or suppose we know that certain acts, though naturally just, are against the public interest in the present circumstances: shall we not use a skill in speaking which is indeed honourable, but which looks like dishonest practice? Further, no one is going to doubt that, if the guilty parties can somehow be converted to a right way of thinking (and it is conceded that this is possible), it is more in the public interest that they should be acquitted than that they should be punished. So if it is clear to the orator that a man against whom true charges are brought will become a good man, will he not work to secure his acquittal? Next, imagine that a good general, someone without whom the state cannot defeat its enemies, is labouring under a manifestly true charge: will not the common good call our orator to his side? Fabricius anyway openly used his vote to have Cornelius Rufinus, whowas a bad citizen and also his personal enemy, elected consul, because he knew he was a competent commander, and war was imminent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_219_29" id="target_note_LCL494_219_29"><sup>29</sup></a> When people said they were surprised, Fabricius replied that he would rather be robbed by a fellow citizen than sold into slavery by the enemy. So, if he had been an orator, would he not have defended this Rufinus on a charge of peculation, however plain the facts were? Many similar instances could be given, but any one of them is enough to make the point. I am not arguing that the orator I am shaping will often have to do this, only that, if some such reason compels him to do so, the definition of an orator as â€œa good man
