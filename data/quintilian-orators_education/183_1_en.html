Will he not be concerned sometimes with measurements and figures? We may say that these are part of geometry. Indeed, I think almost anything can come into the orator’s sphere on occasion; if it does not, it will not be his subject.</p>
<p>We were right therefore in saying that the material of rhetoric is everything that is submitted to it for speaking. Our ordinary way of talking confirms this. For when we have taken on a subject to speak about, we often make it clear in our preliminary remarks that the theme has been proposed to us. Gorgias indeed was so sure that it was an orator’s duty to speak on all subjects that he allowed the audience to put questions to him on any subject they chose.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_415_13" id="target_note_LCL124_415_13"><sup>13</sup></a> Hermagoras<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_415_14" id="target_note_LCL124_415_14"><sup>14</sup></a> also, by saying that the material consisted of the Cause and the Questions, thus included all matters submitted to the orator. If he denies that Questions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_415_15" id="target_note_LCL124_415_15"><sup>15</sup></a> belong to rhetoric, his opinion is not the same as mine; but if they do belong to rhetoric, this too supports my position. For there is nothing that does not fall either under “Cause” or under “Questions.” Aristotle, with his three divisions of rhetoric<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_415_16" id="target_note_LCL124_415_16"><sup>16</sup></a>—Forensic, Deliberative, and Epideictic—also brought virtually everything within the orator’s sphere; for there is nothing that does not come under these heads.</p>

<p>A few scholars have also raised the question of “instrument.” By this I mean “that without which the material cannot be shaped into the work we wish to produce.” But, in my view, it is not the art that needs this, but the artist. Knowledge needs no “instrument,” because it can be perfect
