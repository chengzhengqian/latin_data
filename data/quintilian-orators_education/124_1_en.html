<p>Praise and denunciation of laws<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_297_23" id="target_note_LCL124_297_23"><sup>23</sup></a> need greater powers, such as are almost equal to the highest tasks of the orator. Whether this exercise is more like a deliberative or a forensic declamation depends on the custom and law of the states concerned. Among the Greeks, the proposer of a law was called before a judge;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_297_24" id="target_note_LCL124_297_24"><sup>24</sup></a> in Rome, the practice was to speak for and against the proposal in an assembly of the people. In both cases, the points made are few and pretty well defined. For there are in fact just three kinds of law: sacred, public, and private. This division is more relevant when a law is being commended, because then one can advance step by step: it is (1) a law, (2) a public law, (3) a law designed to safeguard religion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_297_25" id="target_note_LCL124_297_25"><sup>25</sup></a> The Questions which usually arise are common to all three types. Doubts may be raised either (1) about the legal status of the proposer (as with Publius Clodius, who was shown not to have been properly elected tribune),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_297_26" id="target_note_LCL124_297_26"><sup>26</sup></a> or (2) about the legality of the proposal itself; this opens up various possibilities: it may be said not to have been promulgated for the statutory three market days,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_297_27" id="target_note_LCL124_297_27"><sup>27</sup></a> or to have been, or now to be, carried on an improper day, or contrary to a tribune’s intercession or to the auspices, or to be subject to some other objection as to its legitimacy; or again, it may be said to be inconsistent with some existing law. But these matters are not relevant to the elementary exercises, which do not involve specific persons, times, or cases.</p>
