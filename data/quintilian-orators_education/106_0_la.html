some later texts, especially Doxapatres’ commentary on Aphthonius’ <span class="italic">Progymnasmata</span> (= <span class="italic">Prolegomenon Sylloge</span> 103–124 Rabe), also provide useful parallels and information. See in general Martin (1974) 2–6, Kennedy (1980) 3–7.</p>
<p>The next question (2.16) is whether rhetoric is useful: of course it is, if the orator is to be a “good man.” More difficult (2.17) is the question whether it is an Art (<span class="italic">technē</span>). This was an issue for philosophers, and we have many texts about it: Sextus Empiricus, op. cit.; Philodemus, <span class="italic">Rhetorica</span> 1 and 2; Cicero, <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 1.102–112; Olympiodorus’ commentary on Plato’s <span class="italic">Gorgias,</span> 69ff. Westerink. For a discussion of these, see especially J. Barnes, <span class="italic">Discourse Analysis Research Group Newsletter</span> 2.2 (Calgary, 1986) 2–22. The debate arose in Hellenistic times; and the denial of the status of <span class="italic">technē</span> to rhetoric seems to have been part of the anti-Stoic polemic of the Peripatetic Critolaus (frs. 25–39 Wehrli). The whole subject—the “quarrel” of philosophy and rhetoric—has often been discussed; but H. von Arnim, <span class="italic">Dio von Prusa</span> (1898) 4–114 remains fundamental.</p>
<p>For Quintilian, of course, rhetoric <span class="italic">is</span> a <span class="italic">technē</span>: but what sort (2.18)? Using the Aristotelian distinction between “theoretical,” “practical (active),” and “poetic (productive)” forms of knowledge, he concludes that it is essentially “active,” but has features in common with the other two kinds. He next (2.19) raises the familiar question whether Art or Nature contributes more to it; he does not (as many do) distinguish Art from “practice,” but simply sees Nature as giving the raw material and Art the form.</p>
<p>That rhetoric may be a “virtue” (2.20) is also a philosopher’s question. The Stoics held that it was, and that only the Wise Man can be the true “orator” (<span class="italic">SVF</span> 3. 654–656).
