since if we were not capable of originality there would never be any progress (4–13). Choice of model is vital, and it is essential to understand why the model is a good one, and to avoid copying the faults which it inevitably possesses (14–18). Our own talents must also be considered, for we cannot go against our nature (19–21). Differences in genre (which Quintilian emphasized in the “canon”) are important, yet all “eloquence” (i.e. all literature, as we should say) has a common element, and it is this which is the proper object of imitation (21–22). Do not attach yourself too much to any one model (23–26), and remember that it is not only verbal skills that we learn from the great writers, but also strategy, emotional understanding, and charm (27). The chapter closes on an optimistic note: we may reasonably hope to surpass our models (28).</p>
<p>10.3–4 deal with methods of writing, 10.5 with what should be written. These chapters are rich in practical detail, and give an insight into Quintilian’s teaching methods. Writing is a very important activity (3.1–4) and must be undertaken with care: one must always be critical, but not obsessively so, and never careless (5–18). An amanuensis can be a distraction, and is not always a help (19–22). One does of course need quiet conditions for work, but it is not a good idea to work outdoors in surroundings that distract attention (23–25). Good health is vital; but be sure to take enough rest (26–27), so that you can work at night, which is the quietest time, with a fresh mind. Of course, we cannot always have ideal conditions; so we must learn to rise above inconveniences and interruptions (28–30). Finally (31–33), Quintilian gives some hints on the use of notebooks and tablets.</p>
