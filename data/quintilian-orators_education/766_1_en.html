This is why the best scholars are all convinced of its great value, not only for pleasure but also for its emotional impact, first because nothing can penetrate to the emotions if it stumbles at the ear—at the threshold, as you might say; and, secondly, because we are naturally attracted by harmony. For there is no other way in which it could happen that the sounds of musical instruments, without articulating any words, could also excite a succession of varied emotions in the listener. In festival competitions, musicians use different means to excite and to calm the feelings; they have different modes for the call to arms and for the entreaty on bended knee, nor is the signal heard when the army goes into battle the same as the call that sounds the retreat.
