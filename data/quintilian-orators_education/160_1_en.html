<p>Those who define rhetoric as “the science of public duties” also exclude bad men, if they regard “science” as virtue; but the restriction to public questions is too narrow.</p>
<p>Albucius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_369_44" id="target_note_LCL124_369_44"><sup>44</sup></a> a well-known teacher and writer, agrees that it is “the science of speaking well,” but he goes wrong when he adds the restrictive phrases “in regard to public questions” and “credibly.” I have already dealt with both these points.</p>
<p>The intention of those who have held that it is the business of rhetoric “to think and speak rightly” is also to be commended.</p>
<p>These, roughly, are the most famous and most seriously discussed definitions. It would be irrelevant and impossible for me to deal with all that have been proposed. It seems to me that there has grown up a perverse desire in writers of textbooks never to formulate anything in words which some predecessor has used. I shall have no such pretentions. What I say will not necessarily be what I have discovered, but what I think right. In this case, it is that rhetoric is “the science of speaking well.” Once the best answer is found, to look for another is to seek something worse.</p>
<p>This granted, we also have a clear answer to the question of what the end, or highest aim or ultimate goal of rhetoric is—the <span class="italic">telos</span> as it is called, to which all arts tend. For if the art is “the science of speaking well,” its end and highest aim is “to speak well.”</p>
