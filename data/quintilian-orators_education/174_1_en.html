if dialectic is, as is generally agreed, because it differs from dialectic in species only, not in genus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_397_28" id="target_note_LCL124_397_28"><sup>28</sup></a> Nor must we omit to point out that there is art implicit in anything which may be done either with art or without it, and also in anything which is better done by one who has learned it than by one who has not. In rhetoric, indeed, not only will the taught surpass the untaught, but the better taught will surpass the less well taught; otherwise there would not be so many rules and the teachers would not be such great men. This is something everyone must admit, but especially those of us who treat oratory as inseparable from the good man.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">The place of rhetoric among the arts</span></span>
<p class="noindent">Some arts are based on theory,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_397_1" id="target_note_LCL124_397_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that is, the knowledge and evaluation of things. An example is astronomy, which requires no action but is content with the simple understanding of its subject of study. This is called a “theoretical” art. Others consist of action; their end is in action, it is achieved by action and, once the act has been performed, nothing remains to do. Such an art is said to be “practical.” Dancing is an example. Others again depend on a result, and achieve their end by the completion of a work which can be seen. We call these “poetic” arts. Painting is an example. We must, in general terms, conclude that rhetoric consists of action, for it is by this that it accomplishes what belongs to its duty. And this has indeed been the universal view. But I think rhetoric also takes much from those other arts.
