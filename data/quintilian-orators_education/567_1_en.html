<p>There is another form of defence in which we defend an action which is in itself unacceptable by taking up—”assuming”—external resources. This is called <span class="italic">kat’ antithesin,</span> “by antithesis.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_241_10" id="target_note_LCL126_241_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Here again there is no literal Latin translation; it is called “Assumptive.” The strongest line to take here is to defend the charge by the motive of the act: such are the defences of Orestes, Horatius, and Milo.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_241_11" id="target_note_LCL126_241_11"><sup>11</sup></a> This is called <span class="italic">antenklēma</span> (countercharge),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_241_12" id="target_note_LCL126_241_12"><sup>12</sup></a> because our whole defence rests on accusing the victim: “He was killed, but he was a robber,” “He was blinded, but he was a rapist.”</p>

Thus a son pleading against his father in a case of disowning, or a husband against his wife if he is accused of wrongful treatment, or &lt;a father&gt; against a son in a case of mental incapacity, may quite properly allege that his action was very much in his own interest.
