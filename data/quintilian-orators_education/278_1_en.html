Messala’s Prooemia are of this kind.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_185_7" id="target_note_LCL125_185_7"><sup>7</sup></a> There is a natural prejudice in favour of people who have difficulties, and a scrupulous judge is always very ready to listen to an advocate who does not present a threat to his integrity. Hence the ancient orators’ trick of concealing their eloquence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_185_8" id="target_note_LCL125_185_8"><sup>8</sup></a>—so unlike the self-advertisement of our own times! We must also avoid giving the impression of being abusive, malicious, proud, or slanderous towards any individual or class,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_185_9" id="target_note_LCL125_185_9"><sup>9</sup></a> especially those who cannot be hurt without turning the judges against us. As to the judge, it would be foolish of me to warn against saying explicitly or even hinting at anything unfavourable to him, were it not that this does happen. The other side’s advocate will also provide us with prooemium material; we can sometimes pay him honour by pretending to be afraid of his eloquence and influence, so as to lead the judge to look on these with suspicion; and sometimes, though very occasionally, we can insult him: for example, Asinius, in his speech for the heirs of Urbinia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_185_10" id="target_note_LCL125_185_10"><sup>10</sup></a> made the appearance of Labienus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_185_11" id="target_note_LCL125_185_11"><sup>11</sup></a> as his opponent’s advocate an argument for the badness of their cause.</p>
<p>Cornelius Celsus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_185_12" id="target_note_LCL125_185_12"><sup>12</sup></a> says that these are not really Prooemia at all, because they are irrelevant to the case. However, I am influenced by the authority of the greatest orators, and I also think that whatever is relevant to the speaker is relevant to the Cause, because it is natural for judges to be more willing to believe those whom they find it easier to listen to.</p>
