orators attached importance to it, so far as their progress had gone. Cicero, great authority as he is, cannot persuade me that Lysias, Herodotus, and Thucydides had little interest in this.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_171_8" id="target_note_LCL127_171_8"><sup>8</sup></a> Perhaps they did not have the same principles as Demosthenes and Plato—but then even these were different from each other.
