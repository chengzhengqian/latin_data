<p>Transference, and Quality, which he calls “accidental” (<span class="italic">kata symbeb</span>ē<span class="italic">kos</span>), explaining this as meaning “whether someone <span class="italic">happens to be</span> a good man or a bad man.” He divides Quality as follows: (1) things to aim at or avoid (this is the Deliberative part of oratory); (2) relating to persons (by this is meant the oratory of praise); (3) relating to affairs (he calls this “pragmatic”), in which the inquiry concerns things themselves, without reference to persons: for example, whether a man is free who is being claimed as a slave, whether wealth produces pride, whether some action is just or good; (4) the “juridical” species, under which roughly the same questions arise, but in relation to certain definite persons: did <span class="italic">that man</span> do this justly or well?</p>
<p>I am aware that there is a different interpretation of the “pragmatic” species in the first book of Cicero’s <span class="italic">Rhetoric,</span> where it is written:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_79_64" id="target_note_LCL125_79_64"><sup>64</sup></a> “The pragmatic species is that in which we consider what is right according to civil usage and equity; in our society, the control of this study is held to be in the hands of the lawyers.” But I have already mentioned what Cicero’s own opinion about these books was.
