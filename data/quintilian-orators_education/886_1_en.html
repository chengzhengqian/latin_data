<p>What is always and in all circumstances becoming for everyone is to act and speak in an honourable way; conversely, it is never becoming for anyone ever to act or speak dishonourably in any circumstances. However, smaller matters and matters which are morally indifferent are generally such that some people may be allowed them and others not, or such that they should be thought more or less excusable or reprehensible according to the person, time, place, or motive involved.

<p>First of all, then, any boasting about oneself is wrong, but an orator’s boasting of his own eloquence is especially wrong. It not only bores the hearers but generally also disgusts them. The human mind has a certain natural loftiness and pride that does not find it easy to bear a superior; consequently, we gladly help the humble and submissive to their feet, because we feel this shows our superiority, and whenever rivalry has vanished, humanity steps in. On the other hand, anyone who rates himself too highly is thought to be oppressive and contemptuous, and to be diminishing others rather than increasing his own stature. Those who are beneath him are therefore jealous (jealousy is the vice of people who will not give way but cannot compete), while his superiors laugh, and good men disapprove. You will generally find the opinion which the arrogant have of themselves to be unfounded; but even when the good qualities are real, it is enough to know that you have them.</p>
