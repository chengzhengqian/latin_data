judges to be attentive and to look kindly on us both in the Narrative and in the Proofs. Prodicus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_217_51" id="target_note_LCL125_217_51"><sup>51</sup></a> thought this was a way of rousing them from their slumbers. For example: “Then Gaius Varenus, the man who was killed by Ancharius’ slaves—please, members of the jury, pay careful attention here.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_217_52" id="target_note_LCL125_217_52"><sup>52</sup></a> Certainly, if the case is a complex one, each part needs its own preface, such as “Now hear what comes next,” or “I now pass to . . .” Even within the Proofs there are many passages which function as a Prooemium, as for example where Cicero in the <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_217_53" id="target_note_LCL125_217_53"><sup>53</sup></a> is about to attack the censors, and in the <span class="italic">Pro Murena</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_217_54" id="target_note_LCL125_217_54"><sup>54</sup></a> when he apologizes to Servius. The practice is too common to need illustration.</p>
<p>However, when we <span class="italic">have</span> used a Prooemium, whether we then pass to a statement of facts or straight to the proofs, the last item in the Prooemium ought to be that to which the beginning of the next section can most conveniently be linked. It is a pedantic and childish affectation of the schools to make the transition itself produce some clever thought at all costs, and to seek applause for this sleight of hand, as it were; this is the sort of silly game Ovid is in the habit of playing in the <span class="italic">Metamorphoses,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_217_55a" id="target_note_LCL125_217_55a"><sup>55</sup></a> though he has the excuse of necessity, because he is assembling very different subjects into some semblance of a unity. But why should an orator cover up this transition and mislead the judge, who ought really to be warned to keep his mind on the sequence of events? If the judge is not yet aware that the Narrative is in progress, the first part of its exposition
