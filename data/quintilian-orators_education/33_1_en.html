<p>Attention will next turn to syllables, on which I shall make a few remarks under the heading of orthography.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_115_36" id="target_note_LCL124_115_36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>The teacher responsible will then need to consider how many parts of speech there are, and what they are, although there is little agreement about the number. Earlier writers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_115_37" id="target_note_LCL124_115_37"><sup>37</sup></a> including even Aristotle and Theodectes, listed only verbs, nouns, and “convinctions”; they took the active element in language to be in the verbs, and the material element in the nouns, because the one is what we say, the other is what we say it about, while the “convinctions” provided the connections between them. (I know most people say “conjunctions,” but “convinctions” seems the better translation of <span class="italic">syndesmos.</span>)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_115_38" id="target_note_LCL124_115_38"><sup>38</sup></a> The philosophers, particularly the Stoics, gradually increased the number: articles were first added to “convinctions,” and then “prepositions”; to nouns were added “appellations” and “pronouns,” and the quasi-verbal “participle”; to verbs were added “adverbs.” Our language does not feel its lack of articles, and these are therefore distributed among other parts of speech. In addition, however, there is the “interjection.”</p>
<p>Some, with good authorities to back them, have gone as far as eight parts of speech: so Aristarchus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_115_39" id="target_note_LCL124_115_39"><sup>39</sup></a> and, in our own day, Palaemon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_115_40" id="target_note_LCL124_115_40"><sup>40</sup></a> who both put “vocable” or “appellative” under “noun,” as species of that genus. Those who distinguished “vocable” from “noun” make the total nine. Yet some have also separated “vocable” itself from “appellation,” making “vocable” indicate visible and tangible</p>
