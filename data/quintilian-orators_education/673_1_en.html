<p class="noindent">In this passage, everything is explicit in the words except for the proper name, but it is not the shepherd Menalcas but Vergil who is meant.</p>
<p>Oratory often has a use for Allegory of this kind, but rarely in a pure state, for it is generally combined with words used literally. There is an example of a pure Allegory in Cicero:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_453_70" id="target_note_LCL126_453_70"><sup>70</sup></a> “What I marvel at and complain of is that any human being should so much want to destroy another as actually to scuttle the ship in which he is himself sailing.” But the mixed form is the commonest: “I thought that Milo would always have other storms and squalls to weather, I mean in the troubled waves of our public assemblies.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_453_71" id="target_note_LCL126_453_71"><sup>71</sup></a> If he had not added “of our public assemblies” it would have been a pure Allegory; as it is, he has given us a mixture. In this type, we get both splendour from the imported words, and intelligibility from those used literally.</p>
<p>Much the most splendid type, however, is that in which the charm of all three—Simile, Allegory, and Metaphor—is combined: “What strait or tide race, do you think, has so many movements or such violent and varied eddies and changes and waves as the disturbance and ebb and flow of our system of elections? The passing of a single day, the interval of a single night, often throws everything into confusion,
