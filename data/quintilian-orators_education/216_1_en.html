<p>(3) Quantity, which was divided by later thinkers into two, namely size and number.</p>
<p>(4) Relation; from this come the Issues of Transference and Comparison.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_61_19" id="target_note_LCL125_61_19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>(5) Place.</p>
<p>(6) Time.</p>
<p>(7)–(9) To do, to suffer, and to have<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_61_20" id="target_note_LCL125_61_20"><sup>20</sup></a> (for example, “to be armed” or “to be clothed”).</p>
<p>(10) <span class="italic">Keisthai,</span> which means to be in a certain position, for example, to lie down or to stand.</p>
<p>The first four of these seem relevant to Issues, the remainder to various topics of Argument.</p>
<p>Others have listed nine elements:</p>
<p>(1) Person, involving questions about mind, body, and external factors: I can see that this is instrumental in Conjecture and Quality.</p>
<p>(2) Time (what the Greeks call <span class="italic">chronos</span>), from which, for example, comes the question whether a man whose mother was in bond for debt when she gave birth to him was born a slave.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_61_21" id="target_note_LCL125_61_21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>(3) Place, which seems the basis of declamation themes like “whether it was right to murder the tyrant in the temple”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_61_22" id="target_note_LCL125_61_22"><sup>22</sup></a> or “whether a man who hid himself away at home has served a sentence of exile.”</p>
<p>(4) Time in a second sense (what the Greeks call <span class="italic">kairos</span>): it is thought of as a special case of time in the first sense, for example “summer” or “winter.” “The reveller in the plague”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_61_23" id="target_note_LCL125_61_23"><sup>23</sup></a> comes under this head.</p>
<p>(5) Act <span class="italic">(praxis),</span> to which they refer the Questions “Did he commit the act knowingly or unknowingly, by necessity or by chance?” and so on.</p>
<p>(6) Number, which falls under the species of Quality:</p>
