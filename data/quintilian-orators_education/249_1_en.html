All the same, we shall always first address the point which could be a subject of deliberation even apart from consequences.</p>
<p>Some have held that the main heads of advice are honour, expediency, and necessity. I can see no place for the third of these. However great the force that threatens, though there is a necessity of suffering, there is no necessity to do anything; and deliberation is about doing something.
