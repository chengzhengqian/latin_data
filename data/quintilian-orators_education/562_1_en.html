<p>The most useful resource for establishing and refuting a Definition is to be found in Properties and Differentiae, sometimes also in Etymology. But all these things (as happens in other matters) are confirmed by Equity, and sometimes also by a process of conjecture. Etymology is very rare: “What is a ‘tumult’, other than a disturbance on such a scale that a greater fear arises from it? This is the origin of the word ‘tumult’.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_231_25" id="target_note_LCL126_231_25"><sup>25</sup></a> Much subtlety may be exercised over Properties and Differentiae; for example, when the question is whether a person in bond for debt, and ordered by the law to serve until he pays, is a slave. One side defines a slave as “one who is legally in servitude,” the other as “one who is in servitude on the same legal terms as a slave” (or, to use the old expression, “who is serving his servitude”).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_231_26" id="target_note_LCL126_231_26"><sup>26</sup></a> This Definition, though it differs somewhat from the other, is valueless unless it is supported by Properties and Differentiae. [For the opponent will say that he is serving his servitude or is under the same legal conditions as a slave.] Let us therefore consider the Properties and the Differentiae on which I touched briefly in passing in Book Five.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_231_27" id="target_note_LCL126_231_27"><sup>27</sup></a> When a slave is manumitted, he becomes a freedman; when a man who is in bond recovers his liberty he becomes a free man; a slave cannot obtain his liberty without the consent of his master; &lt;a man who is in bond will obtain it by paying his debt, even without his master’s consent&gt;; no law applies to a slave, a person in bond has rights under the law. Properties of a free man—no one except a free man has these—are praenomen, nomen, cognomen, and tribe; a man held in bond possesses these.</p>
