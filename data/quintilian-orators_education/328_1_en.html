<p>As to the end of the Narrative, it is possible to dispute the view of those who hold that it should be continued to the point where the Question begins: “This done, the praetor Publius Dolabella issued an interdict, as is usual, against ‘violence and the use of armed men,’ without any exception, specifying only that he should restore him to the property from which he had expelled him.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_285_87" id="target_note_LCL125_285_87"><sup>87</sup></a> The next words are: “He alleged that he had restored it. A sum was put down as a wager; this is the sum on which you have to rule.” This can always be done on the claimant’s side, not always on the defendant’s.</p>

<p>In the basic order of a speech, Confirmation comes after Narrative. We set things out to be proved, and we now have to prove them. But before I enter on this, I have a few things to say about an opinion held by some people. Most speakers, having expounded the course of events, are in the habit of dashing immediately, without fail, and employing all the attractions at their command, into some rich general topic which will earn applause. This practice originated in the exhibitionism of declaimers, but it has finally reached the courts, because the purpose of pleading a case has now been found to be not the good of the litigants but the self-advertisement of the advocates. The fear is, presumably, that if the concise delicacy usually required for the Narrative were to be followed by the contentious tone of argument, the oratorical delights would be postponed
