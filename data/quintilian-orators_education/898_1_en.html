is admittedly a very difficult one, needs to be addressed here: how can things which are naturally unattractive, and which we should have preferred not to mention had there been a free choice, still be spoken of without breach of decorum? What can have a more repugnant appearance, or produce more antipathy in an audience, than for a son, or his advocates, to have to deliver a peroration against his mother? Yet this must sometimes be done, as in the case of Cluentius Habitus, but not always in the way that Cicero chose to attack Sasia;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_41_54" id="target_note_LCL494_41_54"><sup>54</sup></a> I say this not because he did not do it very well, but because what makes most difference is what the injury is, and how it is inflicted.
