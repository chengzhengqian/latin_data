classic statement of the problems. The most important ancient texts are: Cicero, <span class="italic">Brutus</span> 51, 325; <span class="italic">Orator</span> 27, 212, 230–231; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <span class="italic">Ancient orators</span>, preface (LCL 1. 4–14); Tacitus, <span class="italic">Dialogus</span> 18. The terms themselves, like all polemical slogans, are vague and hard to pin down. It would appear that “Asian” is a pejorative description of types of Hellenistic Greek writing which featured much wordplay, emotional excess, strong rhythm, and short rather than periodic sentences: i.e. styles which seemed to lack classical restraint. The reaction—“Atticism”—has been thought to be mainly Roman in origin: Cicero’s “Atticist” opponents were Calvus and Brutus, Latin stylistic innovators; and Dionysius (op. cit.) attributes the passing of “Asianic” excesses to the beneficial influence of Roman taste. Greek “Atticism”—in the sense of a conscious return to the vocabulary and syntax of the classical period—developed gradually, and was not yet at its height in Quintilian’s time. The whole movement is a reflection of a general return to classical values and supposed simplicity, originating in late Hellenistic times, and displayed in the visual arts as well as in literature. For recent discussions, see M. Winterbottom in <span class="italic">OCD</span><sup>3</sup>, s.v. Asianism and Atticism; Kennedy, <span class="italic">ARRW</span> 97–100; J.

<p>Quintilian’s view of this controversy is determined by his zeal for Cicero. This lies behind his eloquent defence of Demosthenes (23–26) as truly “Attic.” It is also in his mind throughout the following section (27–39), in which he emphasizes the phonetic differences between Greek and Latin, and argues that the peculiar Attic “charm” (<span class="italic">gratia</span>, χάρις) cannot be reproduced in Latin.
