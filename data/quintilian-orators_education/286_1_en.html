<p>Some therefore divide the Prooemium into two parts, the Introduction and the Insinuation,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_201_33" id="target_note_LCL125_201_33"><sup>33</sup></a> the former containing a direct appeal for goodwill and attention. But as this is impossible in Scandalous Causes, let Insinuation worm its way into the judge’s mind, particularly (1) when the thrust of the Cause is not very honourable, either because the affair is disreputable or because it is widely disapproved, or (2) if the mere appearance of the Cause makes it either invidious (if a patron or a father is on the opposite side) or vulnerable to pity (if the opponent is old, blind, or an infant). Our authorities tell us indeed at excessive length what remedies can be used for these difficulties, and they themselves invent fictitious themes and follow them up like real pleadings. But as pleadings derive from Causes, the varieties of which cannot all be covered, they must be multiplied to infinity, unless some general classification is found. The plan in any particular instance will therefore arise out of the special nature of the case. As a universal principle, I am inclined to recommend that we should abandon anything that is damaging and take refuge in what is to our advantage. If our problem comes from the Cause, let the Person come to our aid, and vice versa. If we have nothing that can help us, let us see what will damage our opponent. We must of course hope to gain more favour than he does, but the next best thing is to attract less dislike. When denial is impossible, we must try hard to show either (1) that the offence is less than was stated or (2) that the act was done with other intentions or (3) that it has nothing to do with the present question or (4) that it can be atoned for by repentance or (5) that it has been punished
