<p>(2) Arguments are also derived from place. It is a consideration relevant to the credibility of a Proof whether the scene of the crime was in the mountains or on the plain, by the sea or inland, cultivated or uncultivated, frequented or isolated, near or far, good for the purpose or bad. We see this line followed with great vigour by Cicero in the <span class="italic">Pro Milone.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_385_35" id="target_note_LCL125_385_35"><sup>35</sup></a> These and similar points are more often relevant to Conjecture, but sometimes also to legal Issues: is the place private land or public, sacred or profane, our own or someone else’s? This corresponds to “is he a magistrate, a father, or a stranger?” in a person.

Place is also frequently relevant to Quality, since the same action is not necessarily lawful or fitting everywhere.
