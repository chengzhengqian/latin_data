<p>The third kind of Technical Proof, one which is based on matters introduced into a Cause from outside, is called <span class="italic">paradeigma</span> by the Greeks; they have used this word both generally of any matching of similar things, and especially with reference to things which rest on the authority of history. Our writers have generally preferred <span class="italic">similitudo</span> to render what the Greeks call <span class="italic">parabolē,</span> and <span class="italic">exemplum</span> for this other form; though <span class="italic">exemplum</span> also involves likeness and a <span class="italic">similitudo</span> is an Example. To make exposition easier, let us take both to be <span class="italic">paradeigmata</span> (Paradigms) and let us too call them <span class="italic">exempla</span> (Examples). I am not afraid of appearing to disagree with Cicero, though he distinguishes Comparison from Example.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_431_1" id="target_note_LCL125_431_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For he also divides all Argumentation into two parts, Induction and Ratiocination,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_431_2" id="target_note_LCL125_431_2"><sup>2</sup></a> just as most Greeks have made a division into <span class="italic">paradeigmata</span> and <span class="italic">epicheirēmata</span> and have called <span class="italic">paradeigma</span> “rhetorical induction” (<span class="italic">rhētorikē</span> <span class="italic">epagōgē</span>).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_431_3" id="target_note_LCL125_431_3"><sup>3</sup></a> This method, of which Socrates made great use, consisted of first asking a number of things which the opponent was bound to admit, and finally introducing the point in question, implying that it was similar to the points already conceded. [This is induction.] This cannot be done in a set speech, but what is put as a series of questions in a dialogue commonly takes the form of an assumption here. Thus suppose the questioning goes: “What is the noblest fruit? Is it not that which is the best?” This will be agreed. “What about a horse? Which is the noblest? Is it not the best?”—and then more instances in the same form. Then comes the question to which all these lead up: “What about a man? Is not the
