things in a way other than the direct and truthful one. This comes entirely from inventing opinions of our own or of others or from saying the impossible. (1) Juba invented the opinion of another, when he said to the man who complained of being bespattered with mud by his horse, “What? Do you take me for a Centaur?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_111_96" id="target_note_LCL126_111_96"><sup>96</sup></a> (2) Gaius Cassius invented an opinion of his own when he said to the soldier who was drilling without his sword, “You will have to use your fists well, comrade!” So did Gabba, when served with some fish that had been partially eaten the previous day and had been put on the table with the whole side uppermost: “Let us make haste,” he said, “there are others having dinner downstairs.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_111_97" id="target_note_LCL126_111_97"><sup>97</sup></a> (3) The third type is shown in Cicero’s remark against Curius, which I quoted above:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_111_98" id="target_note_LCL126_111_98"><sup>98</sup></a> it was certainly impossible that he should not have been born at the time when he was practising declamation.</p>
<p>There is also a form of invention based on Irony. Gaius Caesar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_111_99" id="target_note_LCL126_111_99"><sup>99</sup></a> used this: when a witness said that the accused had aimed at his thigh with his sword, and it would have been easy to ask why he should want to strike him there, Caesar said only “What else could he have done, when you were wearing a helmet and a breastplate?”</p>
<p>Simulation is most effective when used against simulation, as once by Domitius Afer. He had an old will, and one of his more recent friends, hoping for something from a change of his dispositions, made up a story, and consulted Afer as to whether one should advise an elderly senior centurion, who had not made a will,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_111_100" id="target_note_LCL126_111_100"><sup>100</sup></a> to put his final wishes in order. “Don’t do it,” said Afer, “you offend him.”</p>
