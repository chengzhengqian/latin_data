<p>These problems are avoided by those who say that the Issue is “that which emerges from attack and defence”; for example “You did it,” answered by either “I did not” or “I was right to do it.” But we have to ask whether the Issue actually <span class="italic">is</span> this, or is merely <span class="italic">in</span> it. Hermagoras<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_59_16" id="target_note_LCL125_59_16"><sup>16</sup></a> defines the Issue as that through which the matter under consideration is understood, and to which the proofs of the parties are referred. My view, bearing in mind that the Issues of the Questions within a Cause are often different, was always to regard the Issue of the Cause as lying in the most powerful point in it, the one on which the matter mainly turned. If anyone prefers to call this a General Question or a General Heading, I shall have no quarrel with him, any more than if he were to invent any other name to signify the same thing, though I know many people have devoted whole volumes to this debate. I am happy to have it called “Issue.”</p>
<p>There are of course great differences of opinion between writers on all other subjects, but here in particular there seems to me to have been a real passion for teaching something different: so far are we from agreement as to either the number of Issues or their names, or as to which are “general” and which are “special.”</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Basic elements of Issues</span></span>
<p>To begin with Aristotle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_59_17" id="target_note_LCL125_59_17"><sup>17</sup></a> He drew up a list of ten elements on which every Question seems to turn. These are:</p>
<p>(1) <span class="italic">Ousia</span> (substance) which Plautus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_59_18" id="target_note_LCL125_59_18"><sup>18</sup></a> calls <span class="italic">essentia,</span> and indeed there is no other Latin word for it; the Question it asks is whether something exists.</p>
<p>(2) Quality, which is easy to understand.</p>
