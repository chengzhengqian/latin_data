evils, we must fight with the weapons of art, and employ whatever means serve our purpose. A man who has been driven off the right road can only be brought back to it by changing course again.</p>
<p>Most of the captious objections to rhetoric, however, arise from the fact that speeches are made on both sides of any Cause. Hence the following arguments: (1) no art contradicts itself, but rhetoric does contradict itself; (2) no art tries to demolish its own work, but this does happen to the work of rhetoric; (3) it teaches either what ought to be said or what ought not to be said, and so it is not an art for one of two reasons: either because it teaches what ought not to be said, or because, having taught what ought to be said, it teaches also the opposite. All these points obviously apply to the rhetoric which is divorced from the good man and from virtue itself; on any other assumption,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_391_23" id="target_note_LCL124_391_23"><sup>23</sup></a> where the Cause is unjust, there is no rhetoric, so that it can hardly happen, even in quite exceptional circumstances, that an orator, that is to say a good man, should speak on both sides.

(1) Rhetoric does not contradict itself. Cause is pitted against Cause, not rhetoric against itself. And even if persons who have learned the same things fight one another, it does not follow that the art, which was imparted to both of them, is not an art. On any other view, there would be no art of arms, because gladiators trained under the same master
