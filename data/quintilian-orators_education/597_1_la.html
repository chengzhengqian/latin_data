<p>8.2 deals with Lucidity in so far as it depends on words. This, says Quintilian, is principally a matter of Propriety—i.e. using the correct and apt words for things—but also involves straightforward order and economy. (Brevity is not a separate virtue for Quintilian.) The chapter is rather negative in tone, and has more to say about avoiding obscurity than about any clearly perceived positive virtue. This seems to have been the regular approach: compare Theon, <span class="italic">Progymnasmata</span> 2. 81–83 Spengel, Anonymus Seguierianus 79–88 (both specifically about Narrative), and Cicero, <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 3.48–50.</p>
<p>8.3 deals in general with verbal <span class="italic">ornatus</span> (κατασκευή, Ornament: “polish” and “finish” are also possible translations). 3.1–11 explains the importance of the topic, and especially the need for Ornament to be “manly” and relevant. Quintilian’s polemic against decadence is much in evidence here. In 3.11–14 he addresses the different needs of the various genres. The main division of the topic (3.15) is into individual words and groups of words. Choice of synonyms (3.15–21) is usually determined by the needs of the Cause, but sometimes by aesthetic considerations. The following section (3.24–39) classifies words as “proper,” “made up,” and “metaphorical”; this is a traditional grouping, first in Aristotle, <span class="italic">Poetics</span> 1457b, and common later. Under the first head (3.24–30), Quintilian interestingly discusses archaisms (compare <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 4.15, <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 3.153; W. D. Lebek, <span class="italic">Verba prisca</span> (1970), Lausberg § 546), showing himself less than enthusiastic about the revival of old Latin words, which was to be the dominant fashion with his successors in the age of Fronto and Apuleius. In what follows (3.30–37) on “made up,” i.e. coined, words, he shows himself alert to changes of us­age—”what
