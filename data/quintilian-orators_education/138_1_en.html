cheerfully and eagerly, they will not be angry when corrected, they will be pleased when they are praised, they will try to earn affection by their application. As the teachers’ business is to teach, so theirs is to make themselves teachable. Neither is sufficient without the other. And just as it takes two parents to produce a human being, and seed is scattered in vain if the ground has not been softened in advance to nurture it, so eloquence cannot develop unless teacher and learner work in harmony together.</p>

<p class="noindent">Once the pupil has been well instructed and sufficiently exercised in these first tasks (which are indeed not trivial, but are parts or members of the greater whole), the time will be approaching for him to attempt deliberative and forensic themes. But before I embark on this, I must say a little about the general principles of Declamation, the last to be invented of all the exercises<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_325_1" id="target_note_LCL124_325_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but by far the most useful, because it both embraces in itself all the things of which we have been speaking, and provides the closest image of reality. Consequently it has become so popular that many think that it is sufficient by itself for the formation of an orator. No excellence—or at least no excellence of continuous speech—can be found which is not also to be found in this type of practice oration.
