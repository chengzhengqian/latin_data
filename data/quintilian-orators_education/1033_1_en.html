speeches, but even from that much more concise orator, Demosthenes. For there would be no need at all then to excite emotions or gratify the ear (Aristotle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_311_80" id="target_note_LCL494_311_80"><sup>80</sup></a> thinks that even Prooemia are unnecessary with such a jury) because those wise men will not be attracted by these things. It is enough to state the facts with precision and point, and to assemble the proofs. But when the judge assigned to us is the people, or some persons drawn from the people, and those who are to pronounce the verdict are (as often happens) unlearned, and (as sometimes happens) uneducated countrymen, we must bring into play every device that we think will help to secure our aims, and both exhibit these in our speech and put them on show in our written version, if indeed the purpose of writing is to teach the right way of speaking. Would Demosthenes have done badly to plead his cases as he wrote them? Would Cicero? Have we any way of knowing the greatness of these orators otherwise than by their writings? Did they then plead better than they wrote, or worse? If worse, then they should have spoken as they wrote; if better, they should have written as they spoke.</p>
<p>So is the orator always to speak as he writes? Yes, always, if he can. “But the time allotted by the judge will be too short to let him do this.” Then a lot of what could have been said will be cut out, and the published version will give everything. Again, some things may have been said because of the characteristics of the judges; these will not be passed on to posterity, lest they should be believed to reflect the orator’s principles rather than the requirements of the moment. The judge’s attitude to what he hears is also very important—indeed, as Cicero advises us, his face is often itself the speaker’s guide.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_311_81" id="target_note_LCL494_311_81"><sup>81</sup></a> You must therefore press
