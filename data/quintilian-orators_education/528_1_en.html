pass on to other Questions without dropping those which come first. This should itself be done in such a way that we do not seem to have ruled them out as hopeless, but only to have omitted them because we can win even without them. An agent for a certain person claims the interest on a loan due to the estate his client has inherited.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_163_14" id="target_note_LCL126_163_14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Question may arise whether this man can legally act as agent. Imagine that, having dealt with this, we give it up, or even are refuted. The next Question will be whether the person in whose name the case has been brought is legally entitled to have an agent. Suppose we abandon this position also. The nature of the case allows the Question whether the person in whose name the proceedings are brought is heir to the creditor, and whether he is heir to the whole estate. Suppose these points also granted: the Question will then be whether the money is due at all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no one will be so foolish, &lt;having treated&gt; what he believes to be his strongest point, as to let it alone and pass to less weighty matters.

Even if you can do this too, you shall not disinherit anyone just for not obeying your wishes. Even if he is subject to you for every other purpose, his Hero’s Choice prevents you from disinheriting him; &lt;even if in general it does not,&gt; this particular Hero’s Choice prevents you.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_163_15" id="target_note_LCL126_163_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>So much for difference in Questions of Law. In Questions of Fact, there may be several points pointing the same way, some of which (but not the main Question) may be dropped. For example, suppose a man accused of theft says, “Prove that you had the property, prove that you lost it, prove that you lost it by theft, prove that the wrongdoing
