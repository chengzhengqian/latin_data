<p>Equally anxious for some novelty, as it seems to me, are those who have added “Order,” having already mentioned “Disposition,” as though Disposition was anything other than the arrangement of the material in the best possible order.</p>
<p>Dion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_27_8" id="target_note_LCL125_27_8"><sup>8</sup></a> gave only Invention and Disposition, but made each of them double, involving both words and things, so that Elocution came under Invention, and Delivery under Disposition, Memory being the fifth department.</p>
<p>The Theodoreans generally divide Invention into two—one part concerned with content, the other with Elocution—and then add the remaining three departments.</p>
