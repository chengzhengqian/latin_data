asks pardon for a deserter as his reward.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_275_5" id="target_note_LCL126_275_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Here, as I have shown, many things can be said against the war-hero law, but the Letter of the law against deserters can only be subverted by the exercise of the choice.</p>
<p>Again, the legal point is either admitted by both parties or in doubt. (1) If it is admitted, the following questions generally arise: Which law is superior? Does it concern gods or men, public life or private citizens, honours or punishments, important matters or trivial? Does it permit, forbid, or command? Another commonly raised point is which law is the older: but the most potent Question, one might say, is which law will lose less: for example, in the case of the deserter and the war hero, if the deserter is not put to death that whole law is subverted, whereas if he is, the war hero still has other possible choices. However, it is of overriding importance in this to consider which is the better and fairer outcome; and no suggestion can be made about this without setting out an actual theme. (2) If the legal point is in doubt, one side (or each side in turn) has a legal controversy to raise. For example: “A father shall have power to lay hands on his son,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_275_6" id="target_note_LCL126_275_6"><sup>6</sup></a> and a former master on his freedman; freedmen shall go to the heir. A man made the son of a freedman his heir. The freedman and his son claim the right over each other.” Here the father &lt;denies that a son can have the right of a former master over his father, and the son&gt; denies that his father had the right, because he was himself under the control of his former master.</p>
<p>Double laws conflict as though there were two laws: for example, “A bastard born before a legitimate child shall be legitimate; if born after, he shall simply have the rights of a citizen.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_275_7" id="target_note_LCL126_275_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
