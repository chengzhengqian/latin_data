next question, which is whether rhetoric is an art. Nobody, of those who have laid down rules for oratory, has of course doubted this: the very titles of their books, “On the Art of Rhetoric,” bear witness to it, and Cicero defines “what is called rhetoric” as “artistic eloquence.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_379_1" id="target_note_LCL124_379_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But not only have orators made this claim, so as to give their studies some prestige, but both Stoic and Peripatetic philosophers for the most part agree with them. I must confess I had doubts about the need to deal with this part of the question: for who is there, I will not say so unlearned, but so lacking in ordinary human sense, as to imagine that there are arts of building and weaving and pottery, but that rhetoric—the greatest and most splendid of achievements, as we have said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_379_2" id="target_note_LCL124_379_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—can have reached its lofty eminence without the aid of art? For my part, I think that those who have argued against this view did not mean what they said, but wanted rather to exercise their intellect on a difficult theme, like Polycrates praising Busiris and Clytemnestra—though he is said to have composed in a similar vein a speech which was delivered against Socrates.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_379_3a" id="target_note_LCL124_379_3a"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
