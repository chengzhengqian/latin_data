<p>Furthermore, good Composition will guide Memory by means of its own patterns. As it is easier to learn verse by heart than prose, so it is easier to learn rhythmical prose than non-rhythmical. This has made it possible even for passages which seemed to be the outpourings of improvisation to be repeated verbatim. Even my own limited powers of memory could achieve this, if I was ever forced to repeat part of a declamation by the late arrival of persons who had a claim to this courtesy. (There is no room for me to lie about this, because some of those who were present are still living.)</p>
<p>However, if I am asked what is the one great art of Memory, the answer is “practice and effort”: the most important thing is to learn a lot by heart and think a lot out without writing, if possible every day. No other faculty is so much developed by practice or so much impaired by neglect. And so not only should children (as I recommended)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_79_19" id="target_note_LCL494_79_19"><sup>19</sup></a> learn as much as possible by heart from the beginning, but students of any age who are concerned to improve their memory by study should be willing to swallow the initially wearisome business of repeating over and over again what they have written or read, and as it were chewing over the same old food. This can be less burdensome if we start by learning a few things at a time, those which do not bore us, and then put the amount up by a line a day, an addition which will not produce any sense of increased work, but will ultimately lead to powers of memory that know no limits. Poetry should be learned first, then oratory, and finally passages which are without rhythmical structure and more remote from oratorical speech, such as the prose of the lawyers. The tasks set for exercise need to be more difficult, so as to make the final object of the exercise
