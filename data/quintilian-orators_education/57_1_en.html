<p>Finally, Usage is the surest teacher of speaking, and we should treat language like money marked with the public stamp.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_163_3" id="target_note_LCL124_163_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Reason: (1) Analogy</span></span>
<p>But all these criteria need keen judgement, especially Analogy, a term which those who translate from the Greek most closely have rendered as <span class="italic">proportio.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_163_4" id="target_note_LCL124_163_4"><sup>4</sup></a> The essence of Analogy is that it refers any doubtful matter to something similar about which there is no question, and tests the uncertain by the certain. This is done in two ways: by comparing similar words, especially with regard to their final syllables (hence monosyllables are said not to be subject to this principle); and by the study of diminutives. In nouns, the comparison reveals either the gender or the declension. (1) Gender: if (for instance) the question is whether <span class="italic">funis</span> (“rope”) is masculine or feminine, <span class="italic">panis</span> (“bread”) is a parallel. (2) Declension: if the question is whether we should say <span class="italic">hac domu</span> or <span class="italic">hac domo, domuum</span> or <span class="italic">domorum,</span> then <span class="italic">anus</span> and <span class="italic">manus</span> would be parallels.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_163_5a" id="target_note_LCL124_163_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> Diminutives only reveal gender: for instance (to keep to the same example) <span class="italic">funiculus</span> proves that <span class="italic">funis</span> is masculine.</p>
<p>The same principle of comparison applies also to verbs. If, following the ancients, someone pronounces <span class="italic">fervere</span> with a short middle syllable, he can be shown to be wrong, because all verbs which end in <span class="italic">-eo</span> in the indicative, if they have <span class="italic">e</span> in the middle syllable of the infinitive, always make it long (<span class="italic">prandeo, pendeo, spondeo, prandēre,</span>
