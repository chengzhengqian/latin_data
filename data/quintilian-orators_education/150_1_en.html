He explains that <span class="italic">rhētorikē</span> in Greek is both a feminine adjective and used substantivally (with ellipse of <span class="italic">technē</span>, “art”). In this second use it corresponds to the abstract noun <span class="italic">eloquentia. Oratoria</span> and <span class="italic">oratrix</span> are respectively an adjective and an agent noun, and so unsuitable to translate the abstract substantive <span class="italic">rhētorikē</span>. In the parallel case of <span class="italic">grammatikē</span>, Latin has the resource of the noun <span class="italic">litteratura</span> (see 2.1.4), but there is no similarly acceptable noun to correspond to <span class="italic">rhētorikē</span>. Latin <span class="italic">-icus</span> adjectives (Q.’s examples, <span class="italic">rhetoricus, piraticus,</span> are both, as it happens, borrowings from Greek) are indeed in use, but cannot be substantivized.
