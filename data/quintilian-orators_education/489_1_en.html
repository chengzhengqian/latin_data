<p>Cicero associates <span class="italic">facetiae</span> with narrative, <span class="italic">dicacitas</span> with repartee.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_85_33" id="target_note_LCL126_85_33"><sup>33</sup></a> Domitius Afer had great charm in the former; there are many narratives of this type to be found inserted in his speeches, though books have also been published of his witty sayings. There is also another kind, not seen in these brief exchanges of verbal missiles and highly concentrated wit but developed at greater length; this is illustrated by the story which Cicero, in Book Two of <span class="italic">De oratore</span> and elsewhere, tells about Lucius Crassus’ handling of Brutus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_85_34" id="target_note_LCL126_85_34"><sup>34</sup></a> Brutus, in his accusation of Gnaeus Plancus, had produced two readers to show that Plancus’ advocate, Crassus, in his speech on the colony of Narbo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_85_35" id="target_note_LCL126_85_35"><sup>35</sup></a> had urged measures contrary to those which he had urged when speaking of the Lex Servilia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_85_36" id="target_note_LCL126_85_36"><sup>36</sup></a> Crassus thereupon produced three readers, and gave them the Dialogues of Brutus’ father to read out.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_85_37" id="target_note_LCL126_85_37"><sup>37</sup></a> One of these covered a conversation on an estate at Privernum, one at Alba, one at Tibur. Crassus proceeded to ask where all these estates were. Now Brutus had sold them all, and in those days it was thought more disgraceful to sell family properties than it is now.</p>
<p>Similar attractive effects follow from expounding fables or sometimes even some episodes from history.</p>
<p>(3) But it is brevity that gives “urbane” wit more point and speed. There are two forms—making a point and replying
