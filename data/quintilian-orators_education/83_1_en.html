<p>It is during these same years that the study of other subjects too must generally begin. Now, as they are arts in their own right and can be perfected without any knowledge of oratory, and on the other hand are not sufficient on their own to produce an orator, the question arises whether they are necessary to our work. What relevance (say some) to pleading a Cause or stating your opinion has the knowledge of how to construct an equilateral triangle on a given line? Will it make a man better at defending a client or guiding policy if he knows the different names and intervals of the notes of a lyre? Perhaps they will even give a long list of people, very serviceable in the courts, who never heard a mathematician lecture and know nothing of the musicians except from the pleasure of listening which we all share.</p>
<p>My answer to these critics is, in the first place, what Marcus Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_215_2" id="target_note_LCL124_215_2"><sup>2</sup></a> frequently says in the book he addressed to Brutus: I am not educating an orator who really exists or has existed, but I have in my mind an image of the ideal orator who has no imperfections at all. Even those who seek to form the Wise Man who is to be perfect in all respects, and, as they say, a sort of mortal god, not only require him to be instructed in the knowledge of things divine and human, but train him in some matters which, if you look at them in themselves, are quite trivial—subtle ambiguities for example—not of course because the fallacies of the “horn”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_215_3" id="target_note_LCL124_215_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the “crocodile”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_215_4a" id="target_note_LCL124_215_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> can make a man wise, but because he ought not to make mistakes even in little things.
