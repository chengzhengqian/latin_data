with which each party charges the other is, at least, agreed to have taken place. With regard to such cases, Celsus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_197_19" id="target_note_LCL126_197_19"><sup>19</sup></a> warns us that this cannot happen in the courts. I cannot conceive that anyone does not know this. After all, the court is convened to try a single accused, and even if there are parties who mutually accuse each other, one of the two cases must be presented before the other. Apollodorus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_197_20" id="target_note_LCL126_197_20"><sup>20</sup></a> also said that <span class="italic">antikatēgoria</span> amounted to two disputes, and in fact, according to the law applied in the forum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_197_21" id="target_note_LCL126_197_21"><sup>21</sup></a> there are two cases.

<p>These cases, moreover, are based on Comparison, but there is more than one method of Comparison. We either set our Cause as a whole against our opponent’s Cause as a whole, or individual Arguments against individual Arguments. Which of the two is to be done can only be known in the light of the needs of the actual case. Cicero in
