<p>This law is more difficult to formulate for the Greeks, because they have several varieties of speech, which they call dialects, and what is wrong in one is sometimes correct in another.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_139_40" id="target_note_LCL124_139_40"><sup>40</sup></a> But with us the principle can be stated very shortly. In every word, the acute falls within three syllables, whether these are the only syllables in the word or the last three, and in these it is either on the penultimate or on the antepenultimate. Moreover, of the three syllables of which I speak, the middle, if long, will be either acute or circumflex; a short syllable in this place will invariably have a grave accent, and so will make the syllable which precedes it (the antepenultimate) acute. Now there must be an acute accent in every word, but never more than one; it is never on the last syllable, and therefore in disyllabic words it must be on the first. Moreover, an acute and a circumflex are never found in the same word, because the circumflex includes an acute; neither of them can therefore occur at the end of a Latin word. Monosyllables however</p>

I have followed the suggestion of J. N. Adams and taken <span class="italic">separata</span> as “special cases”: compare 8.4.29, 11.1.36. Most translators however take it as meaning “in isolation,” i.e. words standing on their own and not <span class="italic">coniuncta</span> (compare, e.g., 1.5.35). I have seriously considered two other possibilities: (1) following Spalding, to take §28 as parenthetical, so that <span class="italic">haec</span> in §29 does not include the case illustrated by <span class="italic">volucres.</span> Q. is then saying that words like <span class="italic">circum,</span> if proclitic, have no accent of their own (this, on this view, is his <span class="italic">praeceptum</span>); but if taken in isolation (e.g. in <span class="italic">stant circum</span>) are accented in accordance with the <span class="italic">vetus lex</span> (which is formulated below, §29, to show the uniformity of Latin accentuation compared with Greek) on the first syllable <span class="italic">(círcum).</span> This would translate: “If these words occur in isolation, they will not be a deviation from our rule [i.e. the proclitic rule stated in §27, which will not apply now]; otherwise, if the usage [i.e. that recommended by the people he is opposing] prevails, the old linguistic law will be annulled”; (2) to take <span class="italic">non</span> ... <span class="italic">aut</span> as <span class="italic">non</span> ... <span class="italic">neque</span> (a possible parallel is Lucan 2.360–362) and translate: “In isolation, however, these will not be a deviation from our rule [i.e. the proclitic rule, which no longer applies] nor, if <span class="italic">consuetudo</span> [i.e. normal educated usage, which has <span class="italic">círcum</span> whether it means “around” or “a circus”] prevails, will the old linguistic law [i.e. the general law to be formulated as in §29] be annulled.” This too means taking §28 as a parenthesis. Both these interpretations make <span class="italic">praeceptum nostrum</span> and <span class="italic">vetus lex</span> distinct; Adams’s view, which I adopt, identifies them, and gives better coherence to the whole passage.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL124_139_39a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL124_139_40"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL124_139_40" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">40</sup>Aeolic was characterized by recessive accent, and Doric accentuation is also said to have differed from Attic–Ionic in some respects (Buck (1955) §103).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL124_139_40').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
