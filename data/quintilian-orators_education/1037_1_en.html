<p>Eloquence thus takes many forms; but it is very foolish to ask which of them the orator should take as his standard. Every variety which is correct has its use, and what is commonly called a “style” (<span class="italic">genus dicendi</span>) is not something that <span class="italic">belongs</span> to the orator. He will use <span class="italic">all</span> “styles,” as circumstances demand, and as required not only by the Cause as a whole but by its various parts. Of course he will not use the same manner in a defence on a capital charge as in an inheritance case or one about interdicts, forfeitures,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_319_96" id="target_note_LCL494_319_96"><sup>96</sup></a> or loans; again, he will preserve the distinction between speeches in the Senate, addresses to the people, and private consultations. He will make many changes of tone, to accord with differences of persons, places, and circumstances. In the course of the one and the same speech, therefore, he will use one style 〈to arouse and another〉 to conciliate, he will not go to the same source for anger as for pity, and he will draw on different skills for imparting information and for arousing emotion. He will not keep to one tone in Prooemium, Narrative, Arguments, Digression,</p>

Q.’s five notes are those called, in the Aristoxenian Greater Perfect System, Proslambanomenos, Hypatē Mesōn, Mesē, Nētē Diezeugmenōn, Nētē Hyperbolaiōn.
