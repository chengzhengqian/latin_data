(2) Rhetoric does <span class="italic">not</span> overthrow its own work. The orator does not refute the argument he has put up, nor does rhetoric either, because, if we take the view of those who regard persuasion as the end of rhetoric, or again if we consider two good men whom (as I suggested) chance may have pitted against each other, what will be sought will be probabilities; and, if one proposition is <span class="italic">more</span> credible than another, it is not contrary to that which is merely credible.

<p>One of these points—namely whether the judge knows what is being spoken of—has nothing to do with the art of the orator. To the other, an answer must be given. “Art deals with things which are known.” Yes: rhetoric is the art of speaking well, and the orator knows how to speak well. “But he does not know whether what he says is true.” Well,
