to be drawn out. For just as all things do not grow in every country, and you would not find a particular bird or animal if you did not know its birthplace or its haunts, while even kinds of fish differ in preferring a smooth or a rocky bottom, or a particular area or coast (you would not land a sturgeon or a parrot-wrasse in our waters!)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_377_22" id="target_note_LCL125_377_22"><sup>22</sup></a>—so every Argument is not found everywhere, and we have therefore to be selective in our search. Otherwise, we shall go greatly astray, waste our labour, and find ourselves depending on accident to discover what we fail to search for methodically. But if we know where everything is “born,” when we come to the Place we shall easily see the Argument in it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_377_23" id="target_note_LCL125_377_23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>First, then, Arguments are often drawn from the person. As I said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_377_24" id="target_note_LCL125_377_24"><sup>24</sup></a> the Division means that we group them all under two heads, things and persons, so that motive, time, place, opportunity, means, method, and the like are accidents of things.</p>
<p>Accidents of persons I need not treat in detail, as many have, but shall only mention those from which Arguments can be derived. These are:</p>
<p>(1) Birth, since men are generally believed to be like their parents and ancestors, and reasons for an honourable or a shameful life sometimes flow from this;</p>
<p>(2) Nationality, since peoples have their own characters, and the same action is not equally probable in a barbarian, a Roman, and a Greek;</p>
<p>(3) Country, because, in the same way, the laws, institutions, and opinions of societies differ;</p>
