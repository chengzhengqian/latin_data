However, in my view, a single motive also may involve several Questions and Points for Decision, as in the case of the man who, having caught his adulterous wife in the act and killed her, subsequently killed the adulterer, who had escaped, in the forum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_161_4a" id="target_note_LCL125_161_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> The motive is a single one: he was an adulterer. But the Questions and Points for Decision are whether it was lawful to kill him at that time and in that place. However, just as, even if there are several Questions each of which has its own Issue, there is a single Issue of the Cause, to which everything is referred, so there is a single proper Point for Decision, on which the judge has to pronounce.</p>

<p>“Motive of action” does not arise in every Controversy. What “motive” can there be when the fact is denied? It is held that, where “motive” is discussed, the Point for Decision</p>
