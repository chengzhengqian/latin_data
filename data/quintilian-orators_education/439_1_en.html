Arguments but in entire Causes, if they are simple, and in Questions. For these also have a Major Premiss—“You have committed sacrilege” or “Not everyone who has killed a man is guilty of murder”—and then a Reason (which is longer in Causes and Questions than in individual Arguments), after which they normally attest their result in a final statement (<span class="italic">complexio</span>), either by enumeration or by a brief formal validation (<span class="italic">conclusio</span>). In this type, the Major Premiss is doubtful, because it is the subject of inquiry.</p>
<p>(2) A second type of Conclusion (<span class="italic">complexio</span>) is not equivalent to the Major Premiss, but has equivalent force. “Death is nothing to us, for that which has been dissolved is not sentient, and that which is not sentient is nothing to us.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_507_12" id="target_note_LCL125_507_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>(3) There is a third form in which the Major Premiss and the Conclusion (<span class="italic">conexio</span>) are not the same: “All animate things are better than inanimate things, there is nothing better than the universe, therefore the universe is animate.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_507_13" id="target_note_LCL125_507_13"><sup>13</sup></a> Here one might think the Major Premiss missing, for the reasoning could have been constructed as follows: “The universe is animate, all animate things are better than inanimate,” and so on. This Major Premiss is either an admitted fact (as in this last example) or to be proved, as in the following: “He who wishes to live a happy life must practise philosophy.” In this case, it is not agreed; and the consequences cannot follow unless the first part is established.</p>
<p>Sometimes again the Minor Premiss is agreed (“but all men want to live a happy life”), sometimes to be proved (“that which has been broken up is not sentient”), because it is doubtful whether, when broken away from the body,
