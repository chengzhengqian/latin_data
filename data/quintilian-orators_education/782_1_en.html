the jerky effect of a run of short syllables that sound almost like a child’s rattle. For, while the beginnings and the clausulae are most important whenever a sentence begins and ends, there are also, as it were, fresh starts in the middle part, and these involve light pauses—just as the foot of a runner, even though it does not rest, still leaves a print. So not only must Cola and Commata begin and end properly, but even in parts which are unquestionably linked together and involve no pause for breath, there are these, as it were, hidden stages. Who can doubt that there is only one thought and one breath in <span class="italic">animadverti iudices omnem accusatoris orationem in duas divisam esse partes</span>?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_199_62" id="target_note_LCL127_199_62"><sup>62</sup></a> Yet the two first words, the next three, and then again the next two and three, have their own special rhythms; and we maintain our breathing as determined by the rhythm. And as these subsections are solemn or vigorous, slow or quick, relaxed or excited, so the whole which is made up of them will be austere or lavish, compact or unstructured. Some clausulae also are lame or hang in the air if left to themselves, but are often caught up and supported by what follows, and if this happens the sequel corrects a weakness which was present in the closing phrase: <span class="italic">non vult populus Romanus obsoletis criminibus accusari Verrem</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_199_63" id="target_note_LCL127_199_63"><sup>63</sup></a> is harsh if you stop at that point; but if this is taken together with the following <span class="italic">nova postulat, inaudita desiderat,</span> though these phrases are naturally separate, the smooth run of the sentence is preserved. <span class="italic">Ut adeas tantum dabis</span>
