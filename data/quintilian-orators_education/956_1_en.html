<p>As for dress, there is no special form for the orator, but his is noticed more. As with all men of standing, it should be distinguished and masculine. Toga,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_157_100" id="target_note_LCL494_157_100"><sup>100</sup></a> shoes, and hair invite criticism both for too much care and for not enough. There are some features of dress which have themselves changed somewhat with the changing times. The ancients wore no <span class="italic">sinus</span> (“fold”), and their successors very short ones. Accordingly, as their arms (according to Greek custom) were kept within their clothes, they must have used different Gestures from ours in the Prooemium. But I am speaking of present conditions. A speaker who is not entitled to the Broad Stripe<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_157_101" id="target_note_LCL494_157_101"><sup>101</sup></a> should gird his tunic in such a way that its front edge falls a little below the knee, and the back edge reaches to the middle of the calf. Anything lower is for women; anything higher is for centurions. It is not difficult to make purple stripes hang properly; carelessness in this sometimes attracts criticism. The rule for wearers of the Broad Stripe is that it should be a little lower than the girt tunic would be.</p>

It was a large piece of woollen material, roughly semicircular, with a width of up to 5.5 metres and a depth of about 1.75 metres. It was first thrown over the left shoulder, so that about 1.5 metres hung down in front and about twice as much behind. This longer portion was then carried round under the right arm and then diagonally across the chest (like a <span class="italic">balteus</span>, “belt”) and over the left shoulder again. A section of this portion hanging in front formed the <span class="italic">sinus</span> (“fold”), and was held up by the left arm. The original length hanging in front from the left shoulder was now <span class="italic">below</span> the rest. A portion of it was then pulled up from above and allowed to hang over the edge of the <span class="italic">balteus</span>: it was now called the <span class="italic">umbo</span> (“boss”), and was the last part to be adjusted. Q. advises that this should be big enough to balance the part of the toga that hung from the left shoulder, and so help to keep it in place.
