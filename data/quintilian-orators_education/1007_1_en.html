<p>undertake the cases of all honest litigants (who are surely the majority), he will give some weight to the character of the people who recommended the Cause to him, and some to that of the litigants themselves, meaning always to be responsive to the wishes of the best men; for, as he is a good man himself, these will also be his closest friends. There are two types of ostentation that he must reject: one consists in advertising his services to the powerful against the weak, the other (which is even more pretentious) in always supporting the lesser folk against the great. Status does not make a Cause either just or unjust. Nor should he feel embarrassed about throwing up a case which he had undertaken when it appeared sound, if he discovers its unjustness in the course of getting it up—though of course he must first come clean with the client.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_259_9" id="target_note_LCL494_259_9"><sup>9</sup></a> I say this because (1) if we are fair judges in this, we confer the greatest benefit by not deceiving a litigant with false hopes (a litigant who refuses to take advice does not even deserve the services of an advocate); (2) the person whom we want as an orator ought not to be defending a Cause which he knows to be unjust (if he defends a wrong cause for one of the reasons given above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_259_10" id="target_note_LCL494_259_10"><sup>10</sup></a> his own conduct will of course be irreproachable).</p>
<p>It is a question whether he should always give his services for nothing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_259_11" id="target_note_LCL494_259_11"><sup>11</sup></a> It is unwise to give an answer to this off the cuff. We all know that far the most honourable course, and the one which is most worthy of a liberal education and of the attitude of mind we expect, is not to sell one’s labour</p>
