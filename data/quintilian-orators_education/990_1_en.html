an orator generally. What philosopher has ever been seen much in the courts or distinguished himself in public assemblies? What philosopher has ever been active in the government of the state, the very subject on which so many of them give so much advice?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_225_3" id="target_note_LCL494_225_3"><sup>3</sup></a> All the same, I should like the orator I am training to be a sort of Roman Wise Man, able to play the part of the real statesman not in private seminars but in the experience and activity of real life.
