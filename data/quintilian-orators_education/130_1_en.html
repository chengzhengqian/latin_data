<p>If this point is won, what remains will be the comparatively easy question of what authors should be read by beginners. Some have recommended the less pretentious authors, because they seemed easier to understand; others, the more florid school, as being better suited to nourish the talents of the very young. I think the best should come both first and always, but among the best the most straightforward and accessible: for example, Livy for boys rather than Sallust.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_309_6" id="target_note_LCL124_309_6"><sup>6</sup></a> (Sallust indeed is the greater historian, but one needs further progress to understand him.) Cicero, in my view at least, is both pleasant reading for beginners, and perfectly accessible; he can not only be useful but can be a favourite. Next (to follow Livy’s advice)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_309_7" id="target_note_LCL124_309_7"><sup>7</sup></a> should come whoever is most like Cicero.</p>
<p>There are two types of writing against which I think boys should be particularly protected. First, let no fanatic devotee of the archaic hope to make them grow stiff by reading the Gracchi,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_309_8a" id="target_note_LCL124_309_8a"><sup>8</sup></a> Cato, and the like; this will only make them uncouth and jejune, for they will not yet be able to grasp the force of these writers with their understanding, and if they content themselves with the style—doubtless excellent in its day but quite alien to our times—they will think themselves on a par with these great men, and nothing could be worse than that. The second thing to be avoided is the opposite: they must not fall for the prettiness of modern self-indulgence, and grow soft with its depraved pleasures, so as to fall in love with that
