statement, as in the riposte of Gaius Caesar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_103_78" id="target_note_LCL126_103_78"><sup>78</sup></a> to Pomponius, who had exhibited a wound on his face received in Sulpicius’ insurrection and boasted of having suffered it while fighting for Caesar: “Never look round when you are running away”; (b) cutting down the actual charge, as Cicero did, when people reproached him for marrying the virgin Publilia when he was sixty, by observing “She will be a woman tomorrow.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_103_79" id="target_note_LCL126_103_79"><sup>79</sup></a> Some people call this type “a Consequence”; very similar to it is Cicero’s remark about Curio,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_103_80" id="target_note_LCL126_103_80"><sup>80</sup></a> who always began his speech by apologizing for his youth: “his Prooemium gets easier every day,” because this seems a natural consequence. Alleging reasons is also a form of Extenuation. Cicero uses this against Vatinius, who was lame, and, wanting to show that he was better, said he now walked two miles a day. “Yes,” said Cicero, “the days are getting longer.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_103_81" id="target_note_LCL126_103_81"><sup>81</sup></a> Again, Augustus remarked, when the citizens of Tarraco reported that a palm tree had grown on his altar, “Now we know how often you light the fire on it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_103_82" id="target_note_LCL126_103_82"><sup>82</sup></a> (5) Humorous Transference of a charge is illustrated by Cassius Severus’ remark, on being reproved by the praetor because his advocates had insulted Lucius Varius, the Epicurean friend of Caesar:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_103_83" id="target_note_LCL126_103_83"><sup>83</sup></a> “I don’t know who the people were who insulted him, but I take it they were Stoics.”</p>
