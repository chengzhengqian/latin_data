historians very often introduce when they explain how a war or a rebellion or a plague came about. Besides this, they make a distinction between “complete” and “incomplete” Narratives. Well, everyone can see that! Then they add that a Narrative may relate to the past (which is the commonest form) or to the present (like Cicero’s account of the panic of Chrysogonus’ friends when his name was mentioned)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_221_4" id="target_note_LCL125_221_4"><sup>4</sup></a> or the future (which is possible only for prophets, for a Hypotyposis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_221_5" id="target_note_LCL125_221_5"><sup>5</sup></a> cannot be regarded as a Narrative). Let us keep our time for more important matters.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Is a Narrative essential?</span></span>
<p>Most rhetors think that there must always be a Narrative;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_221_6" id="target_note_LCL125_221_6"><sup>6</sup></a> but there are many considerations which prove this wrong. In the first place, some Causes are so brief that they have a Proposition rather than a Narrative. This sometimes applies to both parties, when (a) there is no statement of facts; (b) the facts are admitted and only the law is in question, as in the centumviral court, with questions like “Should the son or the brother be the heir of a woman who dies intestate?” or “Is puberty determined by age or by physical development?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_221_7" id="target_note_LCL125_221_7"><sup>7</sup></a> or (c) there is scope for Narrative in the facts, but everything is known to the judge beforehand or has been satisfactorily explained in a previous speech. Sometimes again, this situation holds for one party only, usually the plaintiff, either because it is sufficient for him to make a simple preliminary statement or because that is the more expedient course for him. (1) It is sufficient to say “I claim full repayment of the loan in virtue of the stipulation”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_221_8" id="target_note_LCL125_221_8"><sup>8</sup></a> or “I claim the legacy in virtue of the will.”
