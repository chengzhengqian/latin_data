could also make Quality the one and only Issue, because we can always ask what the nature of anything is. But on either of these two views, utter confusion will ensue. There is no difference between believing in a single type of Issue and believing in none, if all Causes belong to the same class.</p>
<p>“Conjecture” is so called from <span class="italic">coniectus,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_65_29" id="target_note_LCL125_65_29"><sup>29</sup></a> that is to say <span class="italic">targeting</span> the reason on truth; hence interpreters of dreams and omens are called <span class="italic">coniectores.</span> However, as will appear from what follows, this type has been given various names.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Two-Issue Theories</span></span>
<p>Some have made out two types of Issue. Archedemus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_65_30" id="target_note_LCL125_65_30"><sup>30</sup></a> gives Conjectural and Definitional, leaving out Quality, because he thought that questions of Quality took the form “what is meant by unfair?” (or “unjust” or “disobedient”) and he calls these “questions of same and other.”</p>
<p>Distinct from this is the opinion of those who fixed again on two types of Issue, but called them “of Denial” and “Juridical.” “Issue of Denial” is what we call “Conjectural,” some giving this name to the whole procedure, because of the denial which it contains, others only to part of it, holding that the accuser uses Conjecture and the defendant Denial. “Juridical” is what in Greek is called <span class="italic">dikaiologikos.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_65_31" id="target_note_LCL125_65_31"><sup>31</sup></a> But, just as Archedemus ruled out Quality, so do these scholars exclude Definition. They subordinate it in fact to the Juridical, and think one has to ask whether it is just for the alleged offence to be called sacrilege or theft
