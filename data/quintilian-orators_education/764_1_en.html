hatred, and pity are the weapons called for, who will tolerate the speaker who rages, weeps, and pleads in Antitheses, Homoeoteleuta, and Parisa, when the fact is that excessive care for words in this way detracts from the credibility of emotions, and, wherever art is put on show, truth seems to be absent?</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">Composition</span></span>
<p>I should not venture to write about Composition after Cicero (there is perhaps no aspect of rhetoric which he treated more thoroughly) if his own contemporaries had not ventured, in their letters to him, to criticize his principles of word arrangement,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_163_1" id="target_note_LCL127_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and if many later writers had not put much on record on the same subject. On most questions, then, I shall be in agreement with Cicero, and I shall deal more briefly with these, because they are uncontroversial; on some points, however, I may perhaps express a slightly different opinion. Even when I make my own view clear, I shall leave my readers free to hold theirs.</p>

<p>I know that some teachers rule out any care for Composition, and argue that raw language, just as it comes out, is sometimes more “natural” and sometimes also more “masculine.” If they confine the term “natural” to what develops first by nature, in the state in which it is before cultivation, then that undermines our whole art of oratory. Primitive men did not of course speak with our rules and standards
