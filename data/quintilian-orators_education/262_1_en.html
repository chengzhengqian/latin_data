<span class="label"><span class="italic">Order of planning and order of finished speech</span></span>
<p>Of the five parts I have thus established, the one to be spoken first is not the one to be thought out first. The speaker must consider, before anything else, what type of Cause it is, what the Questions in it are, what is advantageous and what disadvantageous, next what is to be established and what refuted, and then again how the Narrative is to be composed; for the statement of facts is a preparation for the proofs, and cannot be of any use unless the speaker has already decided what promises he should make regarding the proofs. The very last point to consider is how to win the judge’s goodwill. For we cannot know, until we have carefully considered the parts of the whole Cause, what attitude it is expedient to try to induce in the judge—severe or merciful, tense or relaxed, averse to influence or susceptible.</p>
<p>I cannot however approve those who think the Prooemium should also be <span class="italic">written</span> last. For, while the material needs to be gathered, and a decision made about the proper place for each item before we can begin to speak or write, we do have to begin with what comes first. Nobody begins a painting or a statue with the feet, nor in general is any work of art finished off at the point where it has to be begun. Anyway, what will happen if we have no time to write out our speech? Will not this reversal of natural habit prove our undoing? We must therefore consider the subject matter in the order I have suggested, but write the speech in the order in which we deliver it.</p>
