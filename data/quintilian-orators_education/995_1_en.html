<p>has produced the most distinguished men of eloquence. The Peripatetics also boast of some rhetorical activity; the practice of delivering “theses” as an exercise was mainly instituted by them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_235_20" id="target_note_LCL494_235_20"><sup>20</sup></a> The Stoics, though they have to confess that their teachers lacked any fullness or elegance of oratory, maintain that these teachers have no superiors for acuteness of proof and subtlety of inference. But these rival claims are between philosophers themselves—that is to say, between people who feel bound by a sort of oath of allegiance, or even constrained by superstitious scruples, to think it wicked to depart from a conviction they have once adopted. The orator on the other hand has no need to swear allegiance to anyone’s laws. It is a greater and nobler office at which he aims and for which he is in a sense a candidate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_235_21" id="target_note_LCL494_235_21"><sup>21</sup></a> if indeed he is to attain perfection by the merits both of his life and of his eloquence. Thus, as a model of oratory, he will pick the most eloquent for imitation, but for forming his character he will choose the noblest possible precepts and the most direct road to virtue. He will use all sorts of exercise, but devote himself primarily to whatever is highest and naturally finest. And what subject can be found richer in material for weighty and copious eloquence than Virtue, the State, Providence, the Origin of the Soul, or Friendship? Here are themes to elevate mind and language alike: “What things are truly good?” “What can calm fear, restrain desire, free us from common misconceptions, and 〈bring〉 the heaven-born soul 〈into contact with its starry kindred〉?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_235_22" id="target_note_LCL494_235_22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
