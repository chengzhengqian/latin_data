speeches he is eloquent beyond description, so beautifully is everything adapted to the circumstances and the speakers. As for emotions, particularly the softer ones, the least I can say is that no historian has ever presented them more attractively. And so, though by very different qualities, he has come to rival Sallust’s immortal rapidity. It seems to me that Servilius Nonianus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_309_136" id="target_note_LCL127_309_136"><sup>136</sup></a> was absolutely right to say that these two were equal rather than alike. Servilius, whom I heard myself, was a man of distinguished talents, rich in striking remarks (<span class="italic">sententiae</span>), but less concise than the authoritative tone of history requires. This tone was excellently maintained by a slightly earlier writer, Aufidius Bassus, at any rate in his books on the German war; always acceptable for his general style of writing,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_309_137a" id="target_note_LCL127_309_137a"><sup>137</sup></a> he sometimes falls short of his own abilities. There still survives, to enhance the glory of our times, a man worthy to be remembered in future ages; he will be named one day, but we all know who he is.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_309_138" id="target_note_LCL127_309_138"><sup>138</sup></a> Cremutius’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_309_139" id="target_note_LCL127_309_139"><sup>139</sup></a> frankness also has its admirers, and rightly so, though the passages which ruined him have been cut out of the text. There is still plenty of lofty spirit and bold <span class="italic">sententiae</span> to be found in what survives. There are other good writers too, but I am only sampling the various genres, not searching whole libraries.</p>
