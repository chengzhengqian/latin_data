<p>Refutation (<span class="italic">lysis, anaskeuē</span>), the subject of 5.13, is not very commonly treated as a separate subject elsewhere: Apsines 5 (150–167 Dilts–Kennedy) is the fullest extant account, but see also Anon. Seg. 186–190 (43–47 Dilts–Kennedy), <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 2.32–46, Julius Victor 413–416 Halm = 57–61 Giomini–Celentano; Martin 129–133. Quintilian is fairly systematic: 1–3, prosecution is easier than defence; 4–10, how to deal with points (a) derived from the Cause, (b) extraneous to it; 11–15, arrangement of refutations (cf. 5.12.4–5, 14–16 on the arrangement of positive arguments); 15–22, how to refute statements; 23–24, how to refute Examples; 25–35, how to use opponents’ weaknesses; 36–38, no need to answer <span class="italic">every</span> objection; 39–42, how to refute defence arguments. At this point, Quintilian thinks again of the declamation school, and points out how its conditions (and especially its free use of imaginary objections) differ from those of real life (42–50). After some further general advice, he summarizes this group of themes (chapters 11–13), and (after a further dig at mere theorists) prepares the way for his discussion of how to construct Enthymemes or Epicheiremes, which is to be the subject of 5.14.</p>
<p>The detail of this complex chapter will be discussed in the Notes. For the background see especially Caplan on <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 2.28. It begins (1–4) by defining and illustrating Enthymemes <span class="italic">ex consequentibus</span> and <span class="italic">ex pugnantibus.</span> Next (5–9) the five-part Epicheireme is considered, and then (10–13) the three-part variety (the original Enthymeme). An Epicheireme is shown to be a syllogism arguing from <span class="italic">probable</span> premisses; examples are given, and we are told how to refute one (14–23). It is also an imperfect (rhetorical) syllogism (24–26). These “mysteries” (27)
