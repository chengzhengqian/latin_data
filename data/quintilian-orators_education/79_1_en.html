<p>At this elementary stage, it is also useful to show in how many ways particular words may be understood. “Glosses”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_207_12" id="target_note_LCL124_207_12"><sup>12</sup></a> also, that is to say words not in common use, are not the least important area of grammatical scholarship. The <span class="italic">grammatici,</span> however, should take greater care in teaching all the Tropes, which are the main ornaments not only of poetry but also of oratory, and both kinds of Schemata—that is to say, Figures of Speech <span class="italic">(lexis)</span> and of Thought <span class="italic">(dianoia)</span> as they are called; these, like the Tropes, I postpone till I come to deal with the ornaments of style.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_207_13" id="target_note_LCL124_207_13"><sup>13</sup></a> Above all, he should impress upon their minds what is meant by excellence in organization, and in propriety of subject matter; what is appropriate to particular characters; what is praiseworthy in thought or word; and when abundance is acceptable, and when restraint.</p>

It is quite enough to expound versions which are traditional or at any rate rest on good authority. To hunt down everything ever said even by the most despised writer means either wretched pedantry or ostentatious vanity. It suppresses and smothers talents which would be better kept free for other matters. For anyone who goes carefully through every page, whether worth reading or not, may just as well deploy his energies on old wives’ tales. Commentaries by <span class="italic">grammatici</span> are full of this sort of lumber, and are scarcely known to their authors themselves.
