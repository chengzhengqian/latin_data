<p>It is therefore especially important, particularly with little boys, to avoid a dry teacher, just as we avoid a dry soil without moisture for young plants. For with this sort of teaching, they instantly become stunted, and look down at the ground, as it were, because they dare not rise above the level of daily speech. They think leanness means health and weakness good judgement, and while they think it is enough to be without fault they fall into the fault of being without virtues.
