to “stand at the side of the road,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_339_33" id="target_note_LCL126_339_33"><sup>33</sup></a> or when the man who had rent his own limbs with his teeth is said, in a school exercise, to have “sat at table above himself.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_339_34a" id="target_note_LCL126_339_34a"><sup>34</sup></a> These things are thought ingenious, powerful, and audaciously eloquent, and the conviction has now become widespread that nothing is elegant or refined unless it needs interpreting.
