If he has a witness who wants to do damage, he should take care that this desire does not become obvious; he should not question him at first on the subject of the trial, but approach it in a roundabout way, so that what the witness really very much wanted to say seems to be forced out of him. And do not press the questioning too far, lest the witness lose some of his credibility by answering everything, but call him into service only for so much as is reasonable to get out of a single witness. With the witness who is going to tell the truth with reluctance, the prime success for the interrogator is to extort from him what he did not want to say. This can only be done by questioning which starts a long way from the point. He will then give answers which he does not think harm the Cause; later on, he will be led from a number of admissions to the point when he cannot deny what he does not want to say. For, just as in a formal speech we often gather together trivial Arguments, which in themselves seem to do the defendant no harm, and then prove the case against him by their cumulative effect, so a witness of this kind should be interrogated about many points, both preceding and following the events in question—places, times, persons, and so on—so that he is trapped
