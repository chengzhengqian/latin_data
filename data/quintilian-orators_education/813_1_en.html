<span class="label"><span class="italic">Relative usefulness of reading and listening</span></span>
<p>Listeners and readers profit from different things. The speaker stimulates by his animation and kindles our emotions not just by a representation of things, but by their reality. Everything is alive and stirring; we welcome every fresh thought as it is born with joy and anxiety, and are moved not only by the fortunes of the trial but by the risks run by the speakers. Moreover, voice, appropriate gesture, Delivery adapted to every passage (the most potent factor of all in oratory), and, in a word, the whole performance, are all equally instructive. In reading, on the other hand, judgement is surer, because a listenerâ€™s reactions are frequently distorted by personal inclination or by the noisy cries of the applauding audience. We are ashamed to disagree, and our unconscious modesty inhibits us from putting more trust in ourselves than in others; and yet the majority likes what is bad, and an invited audience<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_261_9" id="target_note_LCL127_261_9"><sup>9</sup></a> will applaud even what it does not like. The reverse also happens: bad taste fails to appreciate what is excellently said.</p>
<p>Reading is independent; it does not pass over us with the speed of a performance, and you can go back over it again and again if you have any doubts or if you want to fix it firmly in your memory. Let us go over the text again and work on it. We chew our food and almost liquefy it before we swallow, so as to digest it more easily; similarly, let our reading be made available for memory and imitation, not in an undigested form, but, as it were, softened and reduced to pap by frequent repetition.</p>
