Improvisation, in his view, is not something one would choose for its own sake, but the orator must have the skill in reserve, for use in emergency (7.1–4). It demands a thorough knowledge of the case and its Division (5–7), an acquired facility of language (7–10), and a certain irrational “knack,” which is partly a matter of native imagination, but is only useful if it is trained and backed up by acquired skill (11–23).
