that he had stopped at Bovillae before the ninth hour, so as to wait for Clodius to leave his villa, and repeatedly asked him when Clodius was killed, Cicero replied “Late”!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_89_42" id="target_note_LCL126_89_42"><sup>42</sup></a> This one answer is enough to prevent us from putting a ban on all such witticisms.</p>
<p>Words often have not only more than one meaning, but meanings which are opposite. Nero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_89_43" id="target_note_LCL126_89_43"><sup>43</sup></a> said of a dishonest slave that there was no one in his household more trusted, for nothing was barred or sealed to him.
