<p>events is made up of three stages: everything has &lt;a beginning,&gt; a development, and a culmination: quarrel, then &lt;brawl, then&gt; murder. So here too is an Place for Arguments which support one another. (1) The culmination may be inferred from the beginning: “I cannot hope for the toga with a purple edge when I see the weave begins so drab.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_403_69" id="target_note_LCL125_403_69"><sup>69</sup></a> (2) The other way round: “Sulla’s resigning the dictatorship is a proof that he did not take up arms to set up a tyranny.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_403_70" id="target_note_LCL125_403_70"><sup>70</sup></a> (3) We can similarly argue forwards or backwards from the development stage both in Conjecture and in questions of Equity: should the culmination be referred to the beginning, that is, should the murder be set to the account of the man who started the quarrel?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_403_71" id="target_note_LCL125_403_71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>Arguments are also drawn:</p>
<p>(1) From Similarities: “If self-control is a virtue, abstinence must be one too”; “If a guardian owes a duty of trust, so does an agent.” (This belongs to the category called <span class="italic">epagōgē</span> by the Greeks and “induction” by Cicero.)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_403_72" id="target_note_LCL125_403_72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>(2) From Dissimilarities: “If joy is a good thing, it does not follow that pleasure is”; “What applies to a woman need not apply to a ward.”</p>
<p>(3) From Contraries: “Frugality is a good thing, for luxury is a bad thing”; “If war is the cause of ill, peace will be the cure”; “If a man who has accidentally done harm deserves pardon, a man who has accidentally done good does not deserve a reward.”</p>
<p>(4) From Conflicts: “He who is wise is not a fool.”</p>
