there be in the absence of free and unbridled speech, anger, reproach, earnest prayers, and curses? What milder emotions will there be without the help of compliments, conciliation, and stimulus to cheerfulness? What pleasure, what proof of even a modest degree of expertise can one give, unless one knows how to fix some points in the mind by repetition and others by dwelling on them, to digress and return from digression, to divert a charge from oneself and turn it to another, and to judge what points are to be abandoned and what disregarded? This is where the movement and action of oratory are to be found; without these things it is dead, and there is no breath, as it were, to animate the corpse. But these things must not only be present, they must be deployed and varied (like the notes of a lyre) so as to charm the hearer with their combined music. Generally, indeed, these procedures are open and direct; they do not falsify themselves, they confess what they are. But they do give scope for Figures, as I said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_37_2" id="target_note_LCL127_37_2"><sup>2</sup></a> as the very next Figure can teach us.</p>

Whichever name it is given, the process involves a positive multiplicity of Figures. Let us begin with those which make the proof more pointed and cogent (the type I put first). A simple question goes like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">But who are you? From what shore have you come?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_37_4" id="target_note_LCL127_37_4"><sup>4</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
