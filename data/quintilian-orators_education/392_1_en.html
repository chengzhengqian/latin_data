<p>Personally, I should be satisfied with this generic classification; but there is also a division into species. For on the same principle Arguments can be derived (a) from many to one; (b) from one to many (hence “What happens once, can happen more often”); (c) from part to whole; (d) from Genus to Species; (e) from container to content; (f) from difficult to easy; (g) from remote to close at hand—and indeed from anything to its contrary. In fact, these contrasts are all between greater and lesser, or at least have a similar force; if we followed them all up, there will be no end to the possible subdivisions. The range of Comparison is indeed infinite: pleasanter, graver; more &lt;or less&gt; necessary; more honourable, more expedient. Let us say no more; I do not want to fall into the very longwindedness I am trying to avoid! The number of relevant examples also is infinite, and I shall mention only very few.
