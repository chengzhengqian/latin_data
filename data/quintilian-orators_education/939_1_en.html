<p>But the face is sovereign. It is this that makes us humble, threatening, flattering, sad, cheerful, proud, or submissive; men hang on this; men fix their gaze on this; this is watched even before we start to speak; this makes us love some people and hate others; this makes us understand many things; this often replaces words altogether. Therefore in plays composed for the stage, artists in delivery borrow extra emotion from the masks. Thus in tragedy, Aerope is sad, Medea fierce, Ajax mad, Hercules truculent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_123_49" id="target_note_LCL494_123_49"><sup>49</sup></a> In comedy, on the other hand—quite apart from the features regularly used to distinguish slaves, pimps, parasites, farmers, soldiers, prostitutes, maidservants, old men (stern or mild), young men (moral or loose-living), married ladies, and young girls—the father who has the principal role has one eyebrow raised and the other not, because he is sometimes angry and sometimes calm, and the actors regularly turn towards the audience that side of the mask</p>

Merope, daughter of Cypselus, was the subject of a play of Euripides in which she appeared mourning very excessively for the supposed death of her son: there is thus some ground for Lange’s emendation, as there is also for Petrarch’s Niobe, also famous for her mourning for her children.
