(There is good ground for the common description of an accent as “barbarian or Greek,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_101_18" id="target_note_LCL494_101_18"><sup>18</sup></a> since we distinguish men by their voices as we do bronze by its ring.) This is how to achieve the quality Ennius approves when he says that Cethegus had a “sweet-speaking mouth,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_101_19" id="target_note_LCL494_101_19"><sup>19</sup></a> and avoid what Cicero criticizes in those who, he says, “don’t plead, but bark.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_101_20" id="target_note_LCL494_101_20"><sup>20</sup></a> (There are in fact many faults, which I spoke of in the part of Book One in which I dealt with forming the speech of children,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_101_21" id="target_note_LCL494_101_21"><sup>21</sup></a> because I thought it better to mention them in connection with an age when they could still be put right.) Again (b) correctness is achieved if the voice itself is, first, healthy (as one might say), that is to say without any of the defects I have mentioned; and, secondly, if it is not, on the one hand, dull, ill-formed, coarse, hard, stiff, hoarse, or thick, or, on the other hand, thin, empty, grating, feeble, soft, or effeminate, and if the breath is not short, hard to sustain, or difficult to recover.</p>
<p>(2) Delivery will be lucid, if (a) in the first place, the words are pronounced in full, not (as so often) partly swallowed or clipped; many people fail to carry through the final syllables because they overemphasize the earlier ones. However, though words must be pronounced in full, it is tiresome and offensive to put a value on every letter and, as it were, make a separate item of it. For one thing, vowels often coalesce and some consonants are suppressed when a vowel follows. My previous example, <span class="italic">multum ille et terris</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_101_22" id="target_note_LCL494_101_22"><sup>22</sup></a> illustrates both points. Combinations of harder consonants are also avoided: hence <span class="italic">pellexit</span>,</p>
