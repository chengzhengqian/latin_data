bear to hold my opinion back<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_295_20" id="target_note_LCL124_295_20"><sup>20</sup></a>—that this amounted to an admission of great weakness. For what specific arguments can these people find in the course of cases which continually present new features of various kinds? How can they answer points raised by the other side, make a quick response in debate, or interrogate a witness, if they cannot so much as express the most banal sentiments over common matters which occur in great numbers of Causes without having prepared their words so long before? Inevitably, when they say the same things in several cases, they will either produce the disgust we feel for cold, twice-served-up food, or else will be disgraced by the detection of their wretched stock-in-trade, so familiar to the audience’s memory, and worn to shreds, as it were, by doing numerous different services for poor men who want to put on a show.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_295_21" id="target_note_LCL124_295_21"><sup>21</sup></a> What is more, there is scarcely any topic so general that it can fit any real case, unless it is connected with it by some link arising out of the particular question—and even so it would be obvious that it was not so much an insertion as a patch stuck on,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_295_22" id="target_note_LCL124_295_22"><sup>22</sup></a> either because it is different from its surroundings, or because it is commonly added even irrelevantly, not because it is needed, but because it is ready to hand. (Similarly, some speakers drag in very diffuse general “topics” for the sake of their <span class="italic">sententiae,</span> when the <span class="italic">sententia</span> ought rather to grow out of the topic.) These things are attractive and useful if, and only if, they arise naturally out of the Cause; but the most beautiful verbal expression, unless it helps us to win, is always unnecessary, and sometimes actually damaging. But I have wandered far enough from the point.</p>
