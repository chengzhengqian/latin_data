Or absent on an embassy?” Now we have really got somewhere: a man may have failed to assist his father, and yet be his heir.</p>
<p>Now let the student who has worked this out pass over to the orator son—like a Latin piper, as Cicero says.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_179_25" id="target_note_LCL126_179_25"><sup>25</sup></a> “Granted; but you are no infant, you were not abroad, and you were not on military service.” Is there any answer to this except (once again) “But I am uneducated”? To this there is an obvious retort: “Even if you were unable to plead, you could have been at his side.” And that is true. So the uneducated son then has to return to the intention of the lawgiver: “He wished to punish unfilial behaviour, and I am not unfilial.” To this the orator son will reply “You did act in an unfilial way when you deserved to be disinherited, even if repentance or some ulterior motive has subsequently led you to make the choice you have.” Again, “You were responsible for your father’s being convicted, because you appeared to have made up your mind about his case.” To this, the uneducated son will reply: “<span class="italic">You</span> were part of the cause of his conviction, because you had offended many people and brought enmities upon our house.” These arguments are Conjectural, as is the statement made by the farmer son, by way of “colour,” that his absence was his father’s idea, so as not to endanger the whole family.</p>
<p>These are the elements of the first Question, that of Letter and Spirit.</p>
<p>Let us give it a little more attention, and see if anything more can be discovered. How can this be done? I am carefully reproducing the process of inquiry, in order to teach the skill of inquiry: I therefore abandon fine writing and sacrifice style in order to be useful to students.</p>
