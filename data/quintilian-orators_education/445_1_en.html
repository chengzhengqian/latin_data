themselves on a par with the classics for doing so; and then, when you ask them, they will never tell you who it is they are imitating!</p>
<p>I shall deal with Figures elsewhere.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_519_24" id="target_note_LCL125_519_24"><sup>24</sup></a> For the moment, I make the further point that I disagree also with those who believe that Arguments should always be expressed in language which is pure, lucid, and distinct, but not elevated or ornate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_519_25" id="target_note_LCL125_519_25"><sup>25</sup></a> Of course I admit that the Arguments must be distinct and clear, and indeed that in the less important cases the language and the vocabulary should also be as literal and normal as possible. But if the subject is a grander one, I do not think that any ornament (so long as it does not lead to obscurity) should be denied it. Metaphor itself often illuminates. After all, even lawyers, who take great pains over the precise significance of words, venture to define the shoreline (<span class="italic">litus</span>) as the place where the wave “plays itself out” (<span class="italic">eludit</span>).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_519_26" id="target_note_LCL125_519_26"><sup>26</sup></a> Moreover, the more unattractive a thing is by nature, the more it needs to be seasoned with delights. Argumentation is less suspect when well disguised, and the hearer’s enjoyment does a lot for the credibility of the speaker. Or do we think that Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_519_27" id="target_note_LCL125_519_27"><sup>27</sup></a> was wrong to put “Laws are silent in the midst of arms” and “The laws themselves sometimes put a sword in our hands” in the middle of a passage of Argumentation? The criterion in these matters, however, must be that they are an improvement, and not a hindrance.</p>
