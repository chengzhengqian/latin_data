amounts to a combined Question, when both are equally denied, sometimes to separate Questions, when there is a doubt whether or not the act was committed, and then, if this were agreed, about who did it. The act itself again sometimes involves a single Question—for example, whether a man is dead—and sometimes a double one—did he die of poison or indigestion? (2) A second type of Conjecture, which is concerned with fact alone, occurs when there can be no doubt about the perpetrator, if the fact were once established. (3) A third type is concerned solely with the perpetrator, when the fact is agreed and the dispute turns on who did it.</p>
<p>This third type also has several varieties. The accused either merely denies he did it, or says someone else did it. There is more than one way too of shifting the guilt on to another. Sometimes this results in a mutual accusation, which the Greeks call <span class="italic">antikatēgoria,</span> and some Latin teachers “concertative.” Sometimes again, the charge is put upon some person not at risk in the case; sometimes this is a known person, sometimes an unknown one; when known, the responsibility may be transferred to the intention either of a person outside the case or of the victim himself. In these cases, as in the <span class="italic">antikatēgoria,</span> there is a comparison of persons, motives, and other matters.
