(compare Theon, <span class="italic">Progymnasmata</span> 72 Spengel), after an interval, if possible; but the perfectionism of the poets—or of Isocrates—is irrelevant to the orator, who always has to meet a deadline.</p>
<p>10.5 discusses various written exercises: translation (2–3), Paraphrase (4–11), Thesis and other Progymnasmata (11–13), Declamation (14–23). The value of the last, in particular, depends on its closeness to real situations. Quintilian once again has criticisms to make of current practice and the expectations of parents. Theon’s <span class="italic">Progymnasmata</span> (60–72 Spengel) contains observations which illustrate 10.3–5 generally: Theon 15 (pp. 105–110 Patillon–Bolognesi), a passage extant only in the Armenian version, gives details about the exercise of paraphrase.</p>
<p>10.6 describes a process of composition halfway between writing and impromptu delivery; Quintilian calls it <span class="italic">cogitatio,</span> and it means thinking a speech out in detail in advance without committing anything to writing. This can only be done effectively after long practice, and it demands a good memory. It gives the speaker security, without tying him down at the moment of delivery to the detail of a preexisting text.</p>
<p>10.7 is on improvisation. This was always a highly prized skill (naturally so, in a literary culture in which the oral element was still fundamental), both for its practical use (e.g. in the emergencies of debate) and as a proof of talent. Controversies about the relative value of written and impromptu speeches go back indeed to the early days of Greek written literature, and to sophists like Alcidamas; in the great renaissance of Greek rhetoric, which was beginning in Quintilian’s time, impromptu skills were very highly valued.
