orators have discredited the evidence of whole nations,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_339_2" id="target_note_LCL125_339_2"><sup>2</sup></a> or whole classes of evidence, for example hearsay (“they are not witnesses themselves, they are simply repeating statements not made on oath”) or in extortion trials (“those who swear that they have paid over money to the defendant should be treated as parties to the suit, not as witnesses”).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_339_3" id="target_note_LCL125_339_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Sometimes again the pleading is directed against individuals: we read this type of attack both embedded in the defence in many speeches, and also published separately, as in <span class="italic">Against the Witness Vatinius.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_339_4" id="target_note_LCL125_339_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Let us therefore go into the whole subject, since I have undertaken a complete coverage of an orator’s education.
