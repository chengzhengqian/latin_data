Personally, I feel that the situation is changed by the fact that, in these passages, we join the words together. When I say <span class="italic">circum lítora,</span> I pronounce it as one word and conceal the break, so that there is only one acute, just as in a single word. The case is the same in <span class="italic">Troiae qui primus ab óris.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_137_37" id="target_note_LCL124_137_37"><sup>37</sup></a> Metrical circumstances may also affect the accent, as in <span class="italic">pecudes pictaeque volucres.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_137_38" id="target_note_LCL124_137_38"><sup>38</sup></a> Here, I read <span class="italic">volúcres</span> with an acute on the middle syllable, which, though short by nature, is long by position, so as not to make an iambus, which the heroic metre does not allow. Regarded as a special case, however, these will not be deviations from our rule; otherwise, if the usage described</p>
