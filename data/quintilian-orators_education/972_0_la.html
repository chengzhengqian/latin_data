Stoicism is recommended. Examples rather than precepts, however, and particularly the examples found in Roman history, are the best source of the independence and courage which the orator needs.</p>
<p>He also needs a knowledge of law (12.3). It was the Roman tradition (see Crook (1995) 40–41) to keep legal expertise and advocacy apart. (When Cicero (<span class="italic">Topica</span> 51) reports the saying <span class="italic">non ius: ad Ciceronem</span>—“It’s not a question of law; give it to Cicero”—he identifies his part as pleading the case on factual and moral grounds, not on the interpretation of law.) <span class="italic">Iuris prudentes</span> were a separate group, many very distinguished. This was still true in Quintilian’s time, but he expects his ideal orator to do better, and to have at least sufficient legal knowledge not to be at a loss when difficult points arise; after all, Cicero himself actually planned to write on legal topics (3.1–10). The chapter ends (3.11–12) with a warning against treating either law or philosophy as a “refuge for idleness”; eloquence is a higher and more demanding pursuit than either.</p>
<p>12.4 is a very brief reminder of the importance of history: this too was a Ciceronian point (<span class="italic">De oratore</span> 2.51–64, with Leeman–Pinkster ad loc., esp. 249–252).</p>
<p>12.5 concludes this section on the orator’s equipment (<span class="italic">instrumenta</span>) by speaking of the personal qualities he needs; courage is most important (1–4), but natural endowment of physique and voice counts for a lot, as with Quintilian’s contemporary Trachalus (5–6).</p>
<p>The next four chapters (12.6–12.9) give a general view of the orator’s career: when he should begin (12.6); how he should choose his cases, and whether he should accept fees (12.7); how he should receive his client’s instructions
