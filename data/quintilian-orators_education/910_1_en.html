<p>deeds he had celebrated. And, according to the story, they did indeed pay. A great banquet was held to honour the victory and Simonides was invited, but he was called out of the room by a message that two young men on horseback were said to be asking for him urgently. There were no young men to be found, but he realized from what happened next that the gods were grateful to him. For scarcely had he left the building, when the dining hall collapsed on to the heads of the diners, and so crushed them that the relatives who looked for the bodies for burial could not identify their faces or even their limbs by any marks. Then, it is said, Simonides, who remembered the order in which they had all been sitting, restored the bodies to their respective families. There is however great disagreement among our authorities whether the poem was written for Glaucus of Carystus, Leocrates, Agatharchus, or Scopas, and whether the house was at Pharsalus (as Simonides himself seems to indicate in one passage, and as Apollodorus, Eratosthenes, Euphorion, and Eurypylus of Larissa all say) or at Crannon, as according to Apollas 〈and〉 Callimachus, whom Cicero followed when he popularized the story.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_65_8" id="target_note_LCL494_65_8"><sup>8</sup></a> It is agreed that the Thessalian nobleman Scopas perished at the banquet, his sister’s son is also mentioned, and (it is thought) several descendants of an

Q. here gives an unusual display of grammatical learning. Glaucus of Carystus was a Euboean victor (Demosthenes, <span class="italic">On the Crown</span> 319). Leocrates may be the fifth-century Athenian general who dedicated a statue to Hermes (<span class="italic">Anthologia Palatina</span> 6.144, a poem said to be by Simonides). Agatharchus was an Olympic victor in 536. The Scopadae were the ruling family of Crannon. Apollodorus of Athens (<span class="italic">FGrHist</span> 244 F 67), Eratosthenes of Cyrene (<span class="italic">FGrHist</span> 241 F 34) and Euphorion of Chalcis (see 10.1.56) are great figures of Alexandrian scholarship. Eurypylus of Larissa is unknown. It is Q. who tells us that Simonides’ poem set the scene at Crannon (see D. L. Page, <span class="italic">Poetae Melici Graeci</span> 509–510). The reference to Callimachus is to <span class="italic">Aitia</span> fr. 64 Pfeiffer (but note that D. A. Campbell, loc. cit., prefers the reading <span class="italic">Callimachius</span>, making Apollas a “Callimachean”).
