<p>So far, we have taken all our Questions from the person of the claimant himself. Why should we not make some inquiries regarding the father? It has been said “Whoever has failed to defend his father shall be disinherited.” Why do we not try to ask questions like this too: “Does it apply to <span class="italic">any</span> father whom his son has failed to defend?” We often make this move in <span class="italic">controversiae</span> in which children who fail to maintain their parents are threatened with prison;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_181_26" id="target_note_LCL126_181_26"><sup>26</sup></a> take for example the mother who gave evidence against her son when he was accused of being an alien, or the father who sold his son to a pimp.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_181_27" id="target_note_LCL126_181_27"><sup>27</sup></a> What can we lay hold of in the case of the father whom we are discussing? He was convicted. Now does the law apply only to fathers who have been acquitted? At first sight this presents a difficult problem. But let us not despair; it is easy to believe that the lawgiver intended that innocent men should not be without the help of their children. But the uneducated son cannot decently say this, because he admits that his father was innocent. The theme itself provides another Argument. “A man convicted of treason shall go into exile, together with his advocate.” It seems barely possible that, given the same father, there should be a penalty for a son whether he appeared for the defence or not. Moreover, no law applies to exiles. So it is hard to believe that the Letter of the law should apply to the advocate of a convicted father; for can an exile have any property? The uneducated son raises doubts both about the Letter and about the Spirit; the orator son will stick to the Letter, which makes no exceptions, and will say that the reason for a penalty for failing to defend a father was the fear that sons would be deterred from acting as advocates by the risk of exile; he will also say that
