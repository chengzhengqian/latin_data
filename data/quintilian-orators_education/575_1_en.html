<p>(5) In addition, we have in the schools fictitious cases of wrongdoing not specified by law,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_257_34" id="target_note_LCL126_257_34"><sup>34</sup></a> in which the Question is <span class="italic">either</span> whether the act is not so specified <span class="italic">or</span> whether it is wrongdoing; rarely both.</p>
<p>(6) Misconduct of an embassy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_257_35" id="target_note_LCL126_257_35"><sup>35</sup></a> is a common charge among the Greeks, even in real life; in it, the question is usually raised, as a point of law, whether it is permissible in general to act otherwise than according to instructions, and also how long the office of ambassador continues (some embassies are &lt;to take a message, some also&gt; to bring back the answer): compare the case of Heius who had given evidence against Verres after the completion of the embassy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_257_36" id="target_note_LCL126_257_36"><sup>36</sup></a> It is the Quality of the action that matters most in these cases.</p>
<p>(7) Action damaging to the state.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_257_37" id="target_note_LCL126_257_37"><sup>37</sup></a> Here there arise well-known legal quibbles: what does it mean to “damage the state,” did he in fact damage it or simply fail to benefit it, was the damage done <span class="italic">by</span> him or simply <span class="italic">because of</span> him? The most important Question, however, is that of fact.</p>
<p>(8) Ingratitude.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_257_38a" id="target_note_LCL126_257_38a"><sup>38</sup></a> Here we ask whether the accused has actually received a kindness (this is rarely deniable, for anyone who denies receiving something is ungrateful), how much he has received, and whether he has returned the favour; whether failure to reciprocate necessarily means that one is ungrateful; whether he could have done so; whether he was under an obligation &lt;to repay&gt; what was asked; with what intention he &lt;failed to repay&gt;.</p>
