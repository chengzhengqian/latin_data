<p>It may be convenient also to pretend to have before our own eyes images of things, persons, or utterances, or to express surprise that this is not happening to our opponents or to the judges; “It seems to me . . .” or “Does it not seem to you . . . ?” But great powers of eloquence are needed for this, since things which are false or in their nature unbelievable must either strike the hearer with special force, because they surpass the truth, or else be taken as empty nothings, because they are not true.</p>
<p>Writings as well as words are sometimes made up, as by Asinius in his defence of Liburnia:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_53_51" id="target_note_LCL127_53_51"><sup>51</sup></a> “My mother, who was very dear and very close to me, who lived for me and gave me life twice on the same day . . .” and so on, and then: “shall have no part in my estate.” This is both a Figure in itself and is doubly so when, as in the present case, it is based on a document submitted by the other side. The opponent’s case here involved the reading of a will which ran “Publius Novanius Gallio, to whom, as my benefactor, I will and owe everything, in recognition of his good will towards me . . .” and so on, with other provisions, and finally “shall be my heir.” We thus have what begins to be a sort of Parody.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_53_52" id="target_note_LCL127_53_52"><sup>52</sup></a> (This is a term derived from songs made up to imitate others, and so used by Catachresis for imitations in verse or prose.)</p>
<p>We also often invent Personifications, as Vergil invented Rumour,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_53_53" id="target_note_LCL127_53_53"><sup>53</sup></a> Prodicus (according to Xenophon’s report)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_53_54" id="target_note_LCL127_53_54"><sup>54</sup></a> Pleasure and Virtue, and Ennius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_53_55" id="target_note_LCL127_53_55"><sup>55</sup></a> Death and Life, whom he represents in a Satire as debating with each other. One can also have an imaginary speech with an undefined speaker: “At this point someone says” or “Someone may say.” One can even have speech without any person:</p>
