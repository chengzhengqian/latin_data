<p>These people, however, also claim a reputation for “strong” speaking by their delivery. They shout at every point, and bellow everything out, with “uplifted hand” (as they say),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_339_4" id="target_note_LCL124_339_4"><sup>4</sup></a> with much running up and down, panting, gesticulating violently, and tossing their heads like madmen. Clapping your hands, stamping on the floor, striking your thigh and chest and forehead, are all wonderfully effective with the dingier part of the audience.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_339_5" id="target_note_LCL124_339_5"><sup>5</sup></a> But the educated speaker, just as he knows how to lower the tension often in his speech and constantly vary his style and arrange his material, also knows, in his delivery, how to suit his action to the tone of each part of his speech; if there is any rule which deserves to be always observed, it is to keep, and be seen to keep, within the bounds of decency. My opponents however use the word “force” for what is better described as violence. At the same time, you can find not only some pleaders, but (what is worse) some teachers too, who, having had a little training in speaking, forget method altogether and riot all over the place, as the impulse takes them, calling anyone who has paid more respect to literature a foolish, empty, dithering weakling, or whatever particularly insulting name comes into their mind.</p>
<p>But let us congratulate these people for becoming so competent without effort, method, or training. For myself, having now long since given up both my teaching duties and also my work in the courts, because I thought the most honourable end of my career would be to stop while I was still in demand,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_339_6" id="target_note_LCL124_339_6"><sup>6</sup></a> let me console my leisure hours by research and writing such as this, which I believe will be of use to right-minded young men and is certainly a pleasure to myself.</p>
