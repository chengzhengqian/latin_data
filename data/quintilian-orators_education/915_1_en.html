Origin is also sometimes a means of remembering derived names better, such as Cicero, Verrius, or Aurelius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_75_17" id="target_note_LCL494_75_17"><sup>17</sup></a> But I prefer to pass over this.</p>
<p>Something that every student will find useful is to learn by heart from the same tablets on which he wrote the speech. He thus pursues his memory along a trail, as it were, and sees in his mind’s eye not only the pages but almost the actual lines: and so, when he speaks, he is almost in the position of a person reading aloud. And if we come to an erasure or some addition and alteration, these are a sort of signal, the sight of which prevents us from going wrong. This system, while it bears some resemblance to the Art which I began by describing, is, if my experience has taught me anything, both quicker and more effective.</p>
<p>Learning by heart silently—this again is something which has been discussed—would be ideal, were it not that other thoughts often invade the unoccupied mind, which therefore needs to be kept on the alert by the voice, so that memory can be assisted by the double activity of speaking and listening. But the voice should be subdued, more of a mumble.</p>
