them to be just or unjust, more or less important, more brutal or less so, all make a great impression on the mind of the judge. Some of them help him to weigh up the individual Arguments, others groups of Arguments, others affect the balance of the entire Cause. Now some of these Commonplaces prepare the mind of the judge, others confirm his impressions; but preparation and confirmation also sometimes relate to the whole Cause, sometimes to parts of it, and so have to be added as appropriate in each case.</p>
<p>It is this that makes me surprised at the fierce controversy between the two leaders of opposing schools,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_499_46" id="target_note_LCL125_499_46"><sup>46</sup></a> as to whether Commonplaces should be put after individual Questions (as Theodorus believes) or the judge be instructed before his feelings are moved (as Apollodorus advises)—as though our middle way had ceased to exist, and one did not have to consult the practicalities of the Cause itself!
