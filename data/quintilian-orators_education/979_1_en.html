out of account—let us assume (though it can never happen) that a very bad man and a very good man both have the same amount of talent, industry, and learning: which of the two is to be called the better orator? Of course it will be the one who is also the better man. So a man can never be both a perfect orator and a bad man, because nothing is perfect if there is something else better.</p>
<p>However, as I do not want to seem to have been inventing answers to my own questions, like the Socratics, let us imagine a man so obstinately opposed to the truth as to dare to affirm that, given the same talent, study, and learning, a bad man will be no worse an orator than a good: let us convince even this person’s madness. No one surely will doubt that the aim of all oratory is to make its propositions appear true and honourable to the judge. Which then will find it easier to be convincing, the good man or the bad? The good man of course will also <span class="italic">say</span> true and honourable things more often; but even if some particular duty leads him (and this can happen, as I shall show later) to attempt to make some false statements, he is still bound to be believed more than the other man. Bad men, on the other hand, because they despise opinion and have no idea of what is right, sometimes even forget to keep up the pretence, and so state their case without any modesty, and make their assertions without shame. The consequence is unseemly pertinacity and vain effort spent on points which it is certain can never be made good. They cherish unethical hopes in their Causes just as much as in their lives. It often happens, too, that even when they tell the truth they are not believed, and the appearance of such an advocate is thought to show that the Cause is a bad one.</p>
<p>I must now deal with what seems a general conspiracy
