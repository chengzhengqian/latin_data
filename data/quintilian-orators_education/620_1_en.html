Causes. Epideictic, devised for display, seeks nothing but the pleasure of the hearer; it therefore openly displays all the arts of speech and puts its Ornament on view, because it does not lay traps or plan to win a case but addresses itself solely to the end of praise and glory. And so the speaker, as a sort of salesman of eloquence, will allow the customer to see and almost to handle all his most attractive maxims, all his brilliant words, all his pretty figures, grand metaphors, and studied Composition.

In deliberative oratory the senate demands a loftier tone, the popular assembly a more vehement one.
