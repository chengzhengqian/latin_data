in which many have adopted Figures which are not only harsh but patently damaging to their Cause. “A man condemned for Attempt at Tyranny shall be tortured to make him reveal his accomplices; his accuser shall choose what reward he pleases.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_83_126" id="target_note_LCL127_83_126"><sup>126</sup></a> A man has secured his father’s conviction, and demands as his reward that his father shall not be tortured. The father speaks against this.” In pleading for the father, no one omits to indulge in Figures against the son, on the assumption that the father, when tortured, would name him as an accomplice. What could be stupider? Once the judges have grasped this point, either he will not be tortured (because this is why he wants to be tortured) or his evidence under torture will not be believed. “But it is possible to believe that this is what the father wants.” Maybe; then let him disguise his purpose in order to achieve it. “But what will it profit us (us declaimers, I mean) to understand this, unless we put it into words?” So if this was a case in real life, should we have betrayed the hidden motive in this sort of way? And what if it is not true anyway, and the condemned man may have other reasons for opposing the son’s reward, either that he thinks the law ought to be observed, or that he does not want to be obliged to his accuser, or (the line I personally should prefer to follow) so as to persist in declaring under torture that he is innocent? People who make speeches like this will not always have the excuse that “the inventor of the <span class="italic">controversia</span> wanted this defence to be made.” Very likely he didn’t, but let us suppose he did: does it follow that, if he had a stupid idea, we have to make a stupid speech? Even in pleading actual Causes, I often think we should not consider what the litigant wants.</p>
