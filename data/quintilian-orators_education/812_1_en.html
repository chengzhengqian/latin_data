differ in sound but have the same meaning, so that, from the point of view of meaning, it does not matter which you use: such are <span class="italic">ensis</span> and <span class="italic">gladius.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_259_5" id="target_note_LCL127_259_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Others again, which are properly the names of different objects, are nevertheless used as Tropes to convey the same meaning: such are <span class="italic">ferrum</span> and <span class="italic">mucro.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_259_6" id="target_note_LCL127_259_6"><sup>6</sup></a> It is by Catachresis that we call everyone who murders with any weapon a “knifer” (<span class="italic">sicarius</span>).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_259_7" id="target_note_LCL127_259_7"><sup>7</sup></a> In other cases we use a Periphrasis consisting of several words, like “and store of milk pressed hard,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_259_8" id="target_note_LCL127_259_8"><sup>8</sup></a> or very often a change of Figure: for “I know,” we say “I am not unaware,” “It does not escape me,” “It does not pass me by,” “Who does not know?” and “No one doubts” all mean “I know.” We can borrow too from closely related concepts: “I understand,” “I feel,” “I see” often have the same force as “I know.” Reading will give us rich stores of this kind, and enable us to use them not only as they spring to mind but as they ought to be used. For these terms are not always interchangeable: I can properly say “I see” to signify mental understanding, but I cannot use “understand” of seeing with the eye; “blade” means “sword,” but “sword” does not mean “blade.”</p>
<p>However, while a stock of words may be acquired in this way, we should not read or listen solely for the sake of the words. For in the same sources are to be found examples of everything we teach, examples which are in fact more powerful than those found in the textbooks (at least when the learner has reached the stage of being able to understand without a teacher and follow on his own) because the orator demonstrates what the teacher only prescribed.</p>
