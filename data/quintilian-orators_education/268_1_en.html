Whether Milo was justified in killing Clodius is a Question of Quality. The Point for Decision is Conjectural: did Clodius set an ambush? They also maintain that a Cause is often diverted to a subject which does not properly belong to the Question, but which is the subject of decision. I disagree strongly with this. The Question whether everyone who has exhausted his patrimony is to be barred from the assembly must have its own Point for Decision. So we do not have a Question and a Point for Decision which are different, but a number of Questions and a number of Points for Decision. Again, in the case of Milo, does not the Conjecture itself relate to Quality, since, if Clodius set an ambush, it follows that he was killed justifiably? But when a Cause is diverted to some other subject and the original Question is abandoned, even here the Question is to be found where the Point for Decision lies.</p>
<p>On these matters, even Cicero is somewhat inconsistent. In his <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> (as I said) he followed Hermagoras, while in the <span class="italic">Topics</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_165_9" id="target_note_LCL125_165_9"><sup>9</sup></a> he holds that the <span class="italic">krinomenon</span> is the dispute produced by the Issue and, addressing the lawyer Trebatius, he humorously calls this “the matter before the court”; the factors which hold it together he calls “the Cores” <span class="italic">(continentia),</span> “the buttresses as it were of the defence, without which there is no defence.” Yet in the <span class="italic">Partitiones oratoriae</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_165_10" id="target_note_LCL125_165_10"><sup>10</sup></a> he calls that which is opposed to the defence the “Buttress,” because the Core, since it comes first, is spoken by the prosecutor, the Line of Defence by the accused, while the debate concerning Points for Decision arises from the Questions raised by Line of Defence and Buttress.</p>
