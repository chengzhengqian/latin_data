<p>So no one should despise the elements of <span class="italic">grammaticē,</span> as though they were of little importance. It is not that it is a major task to distinguish consonants from vowels, and to subdivide the former into semivowels and mutes. But as we draw near to the inner shrine of this mystery, the great intricacy of the subject will be apparent, for it is capable not only of sharpening childish minds but of exercising the most profound knowledge and erudition. It is not given to every ear to appreciate the sounds of the letters properly, any more than to distinguish the different musical notes. Yet every <span class="italic">grammaticus</span> will surely go in to minute questions like the following. (1) Are we lacking some necessary letters, not indeed when we are writing Greek words (for then we borrow two from them),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_107_6" id="target_note_LCL124_107_6"><sup>6</sup></a> but strictly in Latin? For example, we feel the lack of the Aeolic digamma<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_107_7" id="target_note_LCL124_107_7"><sup>7</sup></a> in <span class="italic">servus</span> and <span class="italic">vulgus,</span> and there is also a sound between <span class="italic">u</span> and <span class="italic">i</span> (we do not pronounce <span class="italic">optimus</span> and <span class="italic">opimus</span> in the same way),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_107_8a" id="target_note_LCL124_107_8a"><sup>8</sup></a> while in <span class="italic">here</span> the sound heard is neither precisely <span class="italic">e</span> nor <span class="italic">i.</span> (2) Are some letters redundant (apart from the mark of the aspirate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_107_9" id="target_note_LCL124_107_9"><sup>9</sup></a> and if this is necessary, so is its opposite), such as <span class="italic">k,</span> which is also an abbreviation for some names,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_107_10" id="target_note_LCL124_107_10"><sup>10</sup></a> and <span class="italic">q,</span> which (though with us somewhat more slanting) looks and</p>
