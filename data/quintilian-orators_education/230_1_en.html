disown, because this is not an action.” The Question is, “What is an action?” We shall use Definition. “It is not lawful to disown”: we argue by Inference.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_89_79" id="target_note_LCL125_89_79"><sup>79</sup></a> And so on with the other Issues, both Logical and Legal.</p>
<p>I am aware that some people have included Transference among the Logical Issues also, in the following way: “I killed a man, under orders from the general”; “I gave temple gifts to the tyrant because he forced me”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_89_80" id="target_note_LCL125_89_80"><sup>80</sup></a> “I deserted because I was prevented from rejoining the army by storms, floods, illness.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_89_81" id="target_note_LCL125_89_81"><sup>81</sup></a> That is to say, it was not due to me, but to these circumstances. I disagree with this even more frankly. It is not the legal action which is “transferred,” but the motive of the act performed, and this happens in almost every defence. And secondly, a speaker who uses this form of defence is not abandoning the principle of Quality; for as he says he is blameless, we have to think rather in terms of a double Quality, one by which the defence covers both the deed and the accused, and one by which it covers only the accused.</p>
<p>We must therefore accept the view of those whose authority Cicero follows, namely that there are three things which are subjects of enquiry in all disputes—Does it exist? What is it? What kind of thing is it?—for this is what nature herself imposes upon us. First, there must be something which is the subject of doubt; what it is and of what sort it is cannot be established unless its existence is first established, and that is why this is the first Question. But when it is clear that a thing exists, it is not immediately</p>
