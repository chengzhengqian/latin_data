others have discovered. What would have happened in the days when there were no models, if men had decided to do and think of nothing that they did not know already? Nothing of course would have been discovered. So why is it a crime for us to discover something which did not exist before? If those primitives were led by sheer intellectual endowment to make so many innovations, are we not to be stimulated in our search by our certain knowledge that they sought and found? And if they, who had no teachers in anything, have handed down so much to posterity, is the availability of some things not to help us dig out others? Are we to have nothing except what we owe to the kind help of strangers? That would make us like certain painters, who study only to learn how to copy pictures by means of measurements and lines.</p>
<p>(2) It is a disgrace too to be content merely to attain the effect you are imitating. Once again, what would have happened if no one had achieved more than the man he was following? We should have nothing in poetry better than Livius Andronicus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_325_2" id="target_note_LCL127_325_2"><sup>2</sup></a> nothing in history better than the Annals of the <span class="italic">pontifices</span>;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_325_3" id="target_note_LCL127_325_3"><sup>3</sup></a> we should still be going to sea on rafts, and the only painting would consist in drawing outlines round the shadows cast by objects in the sun. Take a comprehensive view: no art has remained as it was when it was discovered, or come to a stop in its early stages. Or are we to condemn our own age to the unique misery of being the first period in which nothing grows? And nothing does grow by imitation alone. But if we are not allowed to add to previous achievements, how can we hope for our ideal orator?
