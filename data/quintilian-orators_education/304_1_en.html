<p>A Narrative is either wholly in our favour, or wholly in favour of our opponents, or a mixture of both. If it is wholly in our favour, let us rest content with the three requirements which make it easier for the judge to understand, to remember, and to believe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_237_32" id="target_note_LCL125_237_32"><sup>32</sup></a> No one should think there is anything reprehensible in my suggestion that a Narrative which is wholly in our favour should be plausible, when it is in fact true. There are many true things that are not very credible, and false things are frequently plausible. We must therefore make just as much effort to make the judge believe the true things we say as to make him believe what we invent. These virtues which I have just mentioned belong of course to other parts of the speech too. Obscurity must be avoided throughout the pleading, proportion must be preserved everywhere, and everything which is said ought to be credible. But these requirements must be particularly observed in the part where the judge is first given the facts; if it turns out that he fails to understand or to remember or to believe us here, our labours in the rest will be in vain.</p>

We may recall Macaulay’s remark on Pitt the Younger: “When he wished to be understood, he never failed to make himself understood . . . When he did not wish to be explicit (and no man who is at the head of affairs always wishes to be explicit) he had a marvel lous power of saying nothing in language which left on his audience the impression that he had said a great deal.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL125_237_31a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL125_237_32"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL125_237_32" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">32</sup>Brevity conduces to memorability, as clarity does to understanding, and plausibility to belief.
