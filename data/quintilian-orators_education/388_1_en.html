<p>(5) From Consequences or Adjuncts: “If justice is a good thing, we must judge rightly”; “If breach of faith is a bad thing, we must not deceive.” Likewise in reverse.</p>
<p>Similar to these, and so to be classified here, because they naturally belong to this group, are the following: “What one has never had, one has not lost”; “A man does not knowingly harm one whom he loves”; “If a man has appointed someone as his heir, he held him dear, still does, and will continue to do so.” But as these statements are indubitable, they almost have the force of irrefutable Signs. However, I call the first group Consequences [<span class="italic">akoloutha</span>], because goodness is a Consequence of wisdom, and the second Concomitants [<span class="italic">parepomena</span>], that is, things which happened before or will happen after.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_405_73" id="target_note_LCL125_405_73"><sup>73</sup></a> I am not troubled about the names: call them what you will, so long as the meaning is clear, and it is seen that the one depends on the time, and the other on the nature of the fact. I have therefore no hesitation in also classifying the following as Consequences, although they offer an Argument from Antecedents to Sequels.
