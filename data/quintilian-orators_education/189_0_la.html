<p>In 9, Quintilian returns to the Forensic Speech, with a preliminary discussion of the Parts of the Speech—from Prooemium to Epilogue—which he will take up in detail in Book Four. His theme for the moment is the practical question of the order in which these elements of a speech are to be planned. This division—usually into five parts: Prooemium, Narrative, Arguments, Refutations, Epilogue—is central to rhetorical teaching at all periods (see Caplan on <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 1.4ff.) and gives the basic structure of many treatises (e.g. <span class="italic">Rhetorica ad Alexandrum,</span> Anonymus Seguierianus, Apsines). Lausberg § 261 summarizes the doctrine, and gives a table showing various schemes in later Latin rhetoricians.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 gives a classification of Causes according to their complexity: they are either Simple, Compound, or Comparative. Cicero (<span class="italic">De inventione</span> 1.17) has this distinction, which is also found in later rhetors (Fortunatianus, 86–91 Halm). It is discussed briefly by Lausberg, § 67.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 discusses Questions, Lines of Defence, Points for Decision and <span class="italic">continens</span> or συνέχον (I translate this as “Core”; “Basic Argument” would also convey the idea). This all provides a procedure for deciding what the problem to be addressed really is. It is based on Hermagoras, though Quintilian does not always use his terminology, is not uncritical of him, and is generally impatient with subtleties which have, he very reasonably thinks, little practical value. Parallel material in <span class="italic">De inventione</span> and <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> (see Caplan) enables us to reconstruct the
