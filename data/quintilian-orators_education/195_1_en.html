<p>The first Roman (to my knowledge at any rate) who wrote anything on this subject was Marcus Cato;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_19_36" id="target_note_LCL125_19_36"><sup>36</sup></a> after him, Marcus Antonius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_19_37" id="target_note_LCL125_19_37"><sup>37</sup></a> made a beginning—this indeed is the only work of his to survive, and it is incomplete. His successors were less famous; but I shall not fail to mention them as occasion demands. But it was Cicero, the unique model both of oratory and of the teaching of oratory, who shed the greatest light on the theory as well as on the practice of eloquence. After him, the most modest course would be to keep silent, had he not himself said that his “rhetorical” books<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_19_38" id="target_note_LCL125_19_38"><sup>38</sup></a> were an indiscretion of his youth, and had he not deliberately omitted, in his “oratorical” books, the details whose absence we often regret. Cornificius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_19_39" id="target_note_LCL125_19_39"><sup>39</sup></a> wrote extensively, and Stertinius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_19_40" id="target_note_LCL125_19_40"><sup>40</sup></a> less extensively, on the same subject; the elder Gallio<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_19_41" id="target_note_LCL125_19_41"><sup>41</sup></a> also contributed, but there is more exact scholarship to be found in Gallio’s predecessors Celsus and Laenas,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_19_42" id="target_note_LCL125_19_42"><sup>42</sup></a> and, in our own lifetime, Verginius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_19_43" id="target_note_LCL125_19_43"><sup>43</sup></a> Pliny,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_19_44" id="target_note_LCL125_19_44"><sup>44</sup></a> and Tutilius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_19_45" id="target_note_LCL125_19_45"><sup>45</sup></a> There are distinguished writers on these matters even today, and if they had covered everything, they would have made my work easier.</p>
