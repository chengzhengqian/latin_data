<p>Cato’s,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_355_6" id="target_note_LCL124_355_6"><sup>6</sup></a> as well as other records, is evidence that Servius Galba escaped condemnation solely through the pity he aroused by not only exhibiting his own little children before the assembly, but also carrying in his arms the child of Sulpicius Gallus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_355_7" id="target_note_LCL124_355_7"><sup>7</sup></a> So also, it is thought, Phryne was saved from danger not by Hyperides’ pleading, admirable as it was, but by the sight of her lovely body, which she had further revealed by opening her dress.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_355_8" id="target_note_LCL124_355_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>If all these things are persuasive, the definition of which we spoke is inadequate, and so those who, although holding the same general view of rhetoric, have judged it to be “the power of persuading by speaking,” have claimed to be more accurate. This definition is given by Gorgias in the dialogue already mentioned, under compulsion apparently from Socrates.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_355_9" id="target_note_LCL124_355_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Theodectes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_355_10" id="target_note_LCL124_355_10"><sup>10</sup></a> does not dissent, whether the book on rhetoric attributed to him is his or, as has been believed, Aristotle’s. It states that the end of rhetoric is “to lead men by speech to the conclusion desired by the speaker.”</p>
<p>But even this does not say enough. Others besides orators persuade or induce compliance with their wishes by speech: for instance, courtesans, flatterers, corrupters. And on the other hand, the orator does not always succeed in persuading, so that sometimes this definition does not fit him, and sometimes it is common also to others who are far from being orators. Yet Apollodorus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_355_11" id="target_note_LCL124_355_11"><sup>11</sup></a> does not move far
