<p>It is even harder to observe errors in tones (<span class="italic">tenores:</span> I note that old writers have <span class="italic">tonores,</span> presumably from the Greek term <span class="italic">tonos</span>) or accents (which the Greeks call <span class="italic">prosodiai</span>), when an acute accent is substituted for a grave or a grave for an acute: for instance, an acute on the first syllable of <span class="italic">Camillus,</span> or grave for circumflex in <span class="italic">Cethegus,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_135_32" id="target_note_LCL124_135_32"><sup>32</sup></a> with the first syllable here also acute (for in this way the quantity of the middle syllable is changed); or again, circumflex for grave, as when the second syllable of <span class="italic">alvei</span> is made circumflex: this actually involves two mistakes, the conflation of two syllables into one, and the use of the circumflex accent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_135_33" id="target_note_LCL124_135_33"><sup>33</sup></a> This happens more often in Greek names, as in <span class="italic">Atrei,</span> which old scholars, when I was young, used to pronounce with an acute on the first syllable, so that the second was necessarily grave: similarly <span class="italic">Nérei</span> and <span class="italic">Térei.</span></p>
<p>This is the traditional doctrine of accents. But I am aware that some learned writers (and even some <span class="italic">grammatici</span>), anxious to preserve certain distinctions between words, sometimes, both in teaching and in speaking, put an acute accent on a closing syllable, as in <span class="italic">quae circum litora,</span></p>

See Lindsay (1894) 148–170; Allen (1965) 83–88; Sihler (1995) 239–242. The use of Greek terminology gave rise to considerable confusion and difficulty for the Latin grammarians, who have to use <span class="italic">gravis</span> for unaccented syllables, and <span class="italic">acutus</span> both for the tonic acute accent of Greek and for the stressed syllables of Latin.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL124_135_31').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL124_135_32"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL124_135_32" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">32</sup>Greek accents Kέθηγος, not Kεθῆγος. Q. sees that this is abnormal in Latin, where a long penultimate always carries the accent; to accent the first syllable therefore implies that the second is short.
