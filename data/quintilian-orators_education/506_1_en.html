<p>Domitius Marsus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_119_112" id="target_note_LCL126_119_112"><sup>112</sup></a> who wrote a very scholarly work on Urbanity, includes also several types of saying which are not ridiculous but elegant, having a certain grace and charm of their own, and not out of place in the most austere speech. These are “urbane,” but they do not raise a laugh. He includes them because the subject of his work is not “Laughter” but “Urbanity,” which he says is a peculiarity of our city, though (as he says) the word was not understood in this sense till a late period, when the term <span class="italic">urbs,</span> even without the addition of a proper noun, came to mean Rome.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_119_113" id="target_note_LCL126_119_113"><sup>113</sup></a> He defines it thus:</p>

He proceeds a little later to define it, following (as he says) Cato’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_119_114" id="target_note_LCL126_119_114"><sup>114</sup></a> opinion, as follows:</p>
