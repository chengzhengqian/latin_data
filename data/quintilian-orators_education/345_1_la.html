rhetorical analogue of induction, in the sense that “arguments” are the analogue of syllogistic reasoning. This too is an Aristotelian subject (<span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 2.20), also treated in <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> (1.46, 4.59–62), Cicero (<span class="italic">De inventione</span> 1.49, <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 3.205, <span class="italic">Topics</span> 44–45), Apsines 6 (167—173 Dilts–Kennedy), Minucianus 341–343 Spengel–Hammer, Anon. Seg. 154–156, 45 Dilts–Kennedy (where Paradigm and Enthymeme are the only two species of “artificial” Proofs); Lausberg §§ 410–426; in general, McCall (1969). For the student of literature (as opposed to logic or technical rhetoric) this is a richer and more suggestive chapter. After some discussion of terminology (1–5), Quintilian proceeds to consider examples from history (perfect parallels or events that can be used as opposites or in <span class="italic">a fortiori</span> arguments, 9–10), with instances from Cicero (11–16). Poetic examples follow (17–20), then proverbs and sayings (21–23) and similes (24–26). The focus of the rest of the chapter is mainly on practical considerations: cautions to be observed, refinements of theory to be avoided, the use of “authorities” (36–40; see Anon. Seg. 181, 51 Dilts–Kennedy), and the possibility of using an opponent’s actions or words in your own interest (43). Quintilian concludes (44) by defending his (and others’) classification of all this as coming under the proofs which depend on “art.”</p>
<p>Chapter 12 is certainly practical in scope. It discusses how arguments should be marshalled—individually or in groups—and how emotional and character arguments can be used. But the main thrust (12.17–22) is one of Quintilian’s attacks on contemporary declamatory practices, with a clear reference at the end to his book on “the decadence of eloquence” (General Introduction, vol. I).</p>
