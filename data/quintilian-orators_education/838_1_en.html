<p>It is our orators above all who enable us to put Roman eloquence on equal terms with Greek. I would happily pit Cicero against any of the Greeks. I know, of course, what a storm of opposition I am raising, especially as it is no part of my plan at present to compare him with Demosthenes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_311_140" id="target_note_LCL127_311_140"><sup>140</sup></a>—and anyway that is not relevant, since I regard Demosthenes as a primary author to read, or rather to learn by heart. The excellences of the two are for the most part, I think, very similar: Strategy; Arrangement; principles of Division, Preparation, and Proof—in a word everything that comes under Invention. In their Elocution, there is some divergence: the one is more concentrated, the other more expansive; one has shorter periods, the other longer ones; one always fights with the sword point, the other often also puts his weight behind the blow; you cannot take anything away in the one, you cannot expand the other; one displays more care, the other more nature. In wit and pathos, the two most powerful elements in emotional writing, our man certainly wins. Perhaps it was the practice of his city that deprived Demosthenes of Epilogues;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_311_141" id="target_note_LCL127_311_141"><sup>141</sup></a> but it may also be the case that the very different nature of the Latin language has robbed Cicero of qualities which Attic speakers admire. In letters (which both of them wrote)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_311_142" id="target_note_LCL127_311_142"><sup>142</sup></a> and in dialogues (there are none by Demosthenes), there is no contest. We have to admit however that Demosthenes was the earlier and very largely made Cicero the great orator that he is. It seems to me, in fact, that Cicero, having devoted himself entirely to the imitation of the Greeks, succeeded in reproducing the forcefulness of Demosthenes, the abundance of Plato, and the elegance of Isocrates. But he did more than reproduce by study the excellences of each: most, or rather all, of his virtues
