I see of course that a <span class="italic">suasoria</span> does not necessarily need a Prooemium, for the reasons I gave above;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_145_50" id="target_note_LCL125_145_50"><sup>50</sup></a> but I do not understand why one has to shout so furiously at the outset; after all, if a consultation is proposed, the man who is asked his opinion does not, if he is of sound mind, proceed to scream, but tries to win the agreement of the person who is consulting him by as civil and humane an approach as possible.
