advantageous, as is apparent from the passage of the <span class="italic">Pro Milone</span> just quoted. Let us remember also that there are many Causes in which we have to confess, excuse, or minimize the facts we are relating; grandeur is a virtue alien to all such situations. Speaking with grandeur is therefore no more a special feature of Narrative than speaking pitifully or maliciously, or with dignity or charm or wit. All these are admirable in their proper place, but they are not the peculiar and inalienable property of this part of the speech.</p>
<p>Likewise, the virtue which Theodectes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_251_44" id="target_note_LCL125_251_44"><sup>44</sup></a> made peculiar to Narrative is indeed appropriate to it, but, again, is common to the other parts as well. He wishes the Narrative to be not only grand but attractive. Others add Vividness, in Greek called <span class="italic">enargeia.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_251_45" id="target_note_LCL125_251_45"><sup>45</sup></a> Nor do I want to deceive anyone by hiding the fact that Cicero also asked for more qualities. He wants the Narrative, in addition to being clear, brief, and credible, to be vivid, in character, and possessing dignity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_251_46" id="target_note_LCL125_251_46"><sup>46</sup></a> But <span class="italic">everything</span> in a speech should be in character and, so far as possible, should possess dignity. As to vividness, it is, to my understanding, undoubtedly an important virtue of Narrative, when a truth requires not only to be told but in a sense to be presented to the sight. All the same, it can be included under Lucidity. This last is a quality which some have thought to be actually damaging on occasion, because (they say) in some Causes the truth has to be obscured. This is absurd, since anyone who wants to obscure something is presenting false statements as true, and needs to strive in his Narrative to make them seem as vivid as possible.</p>
