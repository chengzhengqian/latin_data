luscious sweetness which is all the more attractive to boys because it is closer to their natural instincts.</p>
<p>Once tastes have been formed and are secure from danger, I should recommend reading both the older orators (because, if the solid, masculine force of their genius can be acquired, but without the layer of uncouthness incident to that primitive age, our own more polished product will shine with extra brilliance) and the moderns, who also have many good qualities. Nature has not condemned us to be slow-witted; but we have changed our style and indulged ourselves more than we ought. It is not in natural talent that the ancients are better than we are, but in their aims. There are thus many texts which can well be chosen, but we shall have to take care that they are not contaminated by the contexts in which they are embedded. I am of course happy to admit—indeed, I should positively contend—that there have been in recent times, and still are, orators who ought to be imitated in all their features. But who they are, it is not in everyone’s power to decide. It is safer to stick with the earlier writers, even at the price of error, and I have therefore set the reading of the moderns for a later stage, lest imitation should run ahead of judgement.</p>
