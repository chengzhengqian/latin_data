<p>It has always been thought, and not without reason, that, as Cicero often testifies,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_469_2" id="target_note_LCL125_469_2"><sup>2</sup></a> defence is harder than prosecution. In the first place, prosecution is simpler. There is only one way of presenting a charge, but various ways of countering it, because it is usually enough for the accuser to state that his charge is true, whereas the defence advocate may deny, justify, seek to transfer the case, make excuses, plead for mercy, soften, extenuate, divert the charge, or scorn and ridicule it.
