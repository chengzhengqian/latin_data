started ahead of him.” Motives of action also belong to the past. (b) The second category has been divided by some with unnecessary subtlety: “a sound was heard” is described as “Conjunct Time,” and “a shout was raised” as “Adherent Time.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_389_44" id="target_note_LCL125_389_44"><sup>44</sup></a> (c) To Subsequent Time belong “You hid yourself,” “You ran away,” “Discoloration and swellings appeared.” The defence will use the same stages of Time to detract from the credibility of the charge.</p>
<p>The whole pattern of our actions and words is covered by these stages, but in two ways. Some things occur because something else is going to occur later; other things occur because something else happened before. For example (a) the husband of a beautiful woman is accused of keeping a brothel because he bought a woman who was convicted of adultery;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_389_45" id="target_note_LCL125_389_45"><sup>45</sup></a> (b) a debauchee is accused of parricide because he said to his father “You won’t lecture me any more.” In the first case, the accused is not a brothel-keeper because he bought the woman, but bought her because he was a brothel-keeper; in the second, the accused is not a parricide because he said these words, but said them because he was going to kill his father.</p>
<p>Chance (which itself provides a Place for Arguments) certainly derives from Subsequent Time, though it has a special character of its own. For example: “Scipio was a greater general than Hannibal; he defeated Hannibal.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_389_46" id="target_note_LCL125_389_46"><sup>46</sup></a> “He is a good pilot; he has never been wrecked.” “He is a good farmer; he has had a huge harvest.” Or with the opposite tendency: “He was extravagant; he has exhausted his
