<p>That we have to turn for many things to our reading of the philosophers is due to the fault of the orators, who gave up to them their own rights to the fairest part of their subject.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_271_35" id="target_note_LCL127_271_35"><sup>35</sup></a> Philosophers speak particularly about justice, honour, expediency, and their opposites, as well as about religion; they argue keenly; they provide the future orator with an excellent preparation for cross-examination and debate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_271_36" id="target_note_LCL127_271_36"><sup>36</sup></a> But here too we need similar critical judgement, so as to understand that, even when we are concerned with the same matters, the conditions are not the same in legal cases as in philosophical debate, in the courts as in the lecture room, in theoretical teaching as in real jeopardy.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that I consider reading to be so useful, I expect most of my readers will want me to add a statement of what authors are to be read and the special virtues of each.
