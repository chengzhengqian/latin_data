for example, in adding “by him” if he means the heir, or “by her” if he means his wife, to the word “chosen.” (An ambiguity due to an addition can be remedied by removing the offending word:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_287_14" id="target_note_LCL126_287_14"><sup>14</sup></a> <span class="italic">hunc flentes illos deprendimus,</span> “as we wept for him, we found them” or “we found them weeping for him.”)</p>
<p>When there is both a doubt about what a word refers to, and it is itself ambiguous, it takes several words to put things right: “My heir shall be bound to give him all his property.” Cicero falls into this error in speaking of Gaius Fannius:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_287_15a" id="target_note_LCL126_287_15a"><sup>15</sup></a> “He, at the instigation of his father-in-law, whom, because he had not been elected to the college of augurs, he did not much like, especially as he had preferred his younger son-in-law, Quintus Scaevola, to himself . . .” Here “to himself” may refer either to his father-in-law or to Fannius.</p>
<p>The length or shortness of a syllable, which is left doubtful in a written text, is also a cause of Ambiguity, as in <span class="italic">cato,</span> where a short second syllable in the nominative gives one meaning, &lt;and a long second syllable in the ablative another&gt;.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_287_16" id="target_note_LCL126_287_16"><sup>16</sup></a> There are many other kinds of Ambiguity which it is unnecessary to enumerate.</p>
<p>Nor does it really matter how an Ambiguity is produced or resolved. It is obvious that two things are signified, and, so far as the written or spoken word is concerned, the two sides are equally balanced. It is therefore futile to recommend that, in this Issue, we should try to turn the ex­pression

Cicero goes on to say: “Laelius however excused himself by saying he had given the privilege not to his younger son-in-law but to his elder daughter—anyway, Fannius had been a pupil of Panaetius, on Laelius’ recommendation.” Not a good example of ambiguity; Radermacher may be right to delete the passage.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL126_287_15a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL126_287_16"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL126_287_16" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">16</sup>In <span class="italic">Cato,</span> the proper name, the second syllable may be shortened; in <span class="italic">cato,</span> “shrewd” (dat. or abl. sing. masc.), it cannot.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL126_287_16').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
