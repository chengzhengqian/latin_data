was repeatedly and noisily attacking him, and he retorted “Now I’ll show what you’re like”; whereupon Mancia actually pressed him in his questioning to say what he was going to show he was like, and Julius pointed to the painting of a Gaul on a Cimbric shield, to which indeed Mancia was then seen to possess a strong resemblance. (There were shops around the forum, and this shield was set up by way of a sign.)</p>
<p>(2) To narrate humorous stories is a particularly subtle rhetorical move; for example, Cicero’s narrative in <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_83_30" id="target_note_LCL126_83_30"><sup>30</sup></a> about Caepasius and Fabricius, or Caelius’ story of the quarrel between Decimus Laelius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_83_31" id="target_note_LCL126_83_31"><sup>31</sup></a> and his colleague as they both hurried off to their province. But in all these cases, the whole narrative is executed with elegance and charm, and the orator’s own contribution to it is the most felicitous part. Consider the flavour Cicero gives to Fabricius’ sudden departure: “So, just when he thought he was speaking particularly well, and had produced from the depths of his learning the weighty words ‘Members of the jury, look now upon the fortunes of humanity, look upon the aged form of Gaius Fabricius’—just when he repeated ‘look upon’ several times to give his speech some embellishment, he ‘looked upon’ the scene himself; Fabricius, keeping his head down, had slipped away from the bench . . .”—and so on (the passage is well known): yet all that had really happened was that Fabricius had left the court. The whole of the picture that Caelius gives is delightful, but especially the end: “He followed; but how he crossed over, by raft or by fishing boat, nobody knew. The Sicilians, with their naughty sense of humour, said he rode on a dolphin, and so made the crossing like Arion.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_83_32" id="target_note_LCL126_83_32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
