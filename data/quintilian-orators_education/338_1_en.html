bribery.” This makes the Cause perfectly clear, and no one point renders another superfluous.</p>
<p>Many also feel qualms about the type of defence that runs “If I killed him, I did right; but I did not kill him.” What is the point of the first part, they say, if the second is secure? The two are mutually inconsistent; if both are used, we believe neither. This is of course partly true; if the second statement is beyond doubt, it should be used on its own, but if there is any ground for apprehension about the stronger statement, we should use the double Proof. People are moved by different arguments; a person who believes in the killing may think it was justly done, and a person who is not to be moved by the plea of justice may perhaps not believe in the killing. A sure hand may be content with one shot; an unsure one needs to spray them around, to give fortune a chance too.

The Greeks are right to advise “not attempting the absolutely impossible.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_305_6a" id="target_note_LCL125_305_6a"><sup>6</sup></a> But whenever we employ the double defence
