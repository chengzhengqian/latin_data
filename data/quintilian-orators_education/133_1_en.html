they must be brought back under his guidance. We can observe birds doing something like this: when their young are tender and feeble, they collect food in their own mouths and divide it among them; but when the young seem fully grown, they teach them to go a little way from the nest and circle round it, leading the way themselves, until they have proved their strength and are allowed the freedom of the sky and left to rely on their own self-confidence.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">Learning by heart</span></span>
<p class="noindent">There is one current practice in teaching boys of the age we are discussing which I think ought to be radically altered. They should not learn by heart everything they write and recite it, as is the custom, on a fixed day. This is particularly expected by fathers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_315_1" id="target_note_LCL124_315_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and they are not convinced that their children are learning unless they declaim as often as possible. Yet the truth is that progress depends mainly on patient application. For while I certainly believe in boys writing and being mainly occupied with this, I should much prefer them to learn by heart selected passages of speeches or histories or some other type of book that is worth treating in this way. For (1) it is a better exercise for the memory to take in other people’s words than one’s own; (2) those who are trained in this more difficult task will easily fix their own compositions in their mind, because these are already familiar; (3) they will get used to the best models and always have objects of imitation in their minds; (4) they will now unconsciously reproduce the style of the speech which they have so thoroughly absorbed.
