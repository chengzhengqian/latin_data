<p>of care, art, polish, and any product of study in oratory, as being affected and unnatural, or who claim to imitate antiquity by a rustic vocabulary or even pronunciation, as Cicero says Lucius Cotta did.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_91_9" id="target_note_LCL494_91_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Well, let them keep their opinion that to be born is enough to make a man an orator; but I hope they will pardon the efforts of those of us who think that nothing comes to perfection unless nature is assisted by art.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_91_10" id="target_note_LCL494_91_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Still, as regards Delivery, I am not obstinate: I agree that nature has the main part. Certainly, no one can have a good Delivery who lacks either the power to memorize his written text or a ready facility for speaking impromptu, or who has an incurable speech defect. Some physical deformities also may be beyond the power of art to overcome. Indeed, unless the voice is free of defect, it cannot produce the best Delivery. A good firm voice can be used as we please; a poor or weak one inhibits many effects (for example, a crescendo or a loud cry) and forces us to do things like breaking off, lowering the pitch, or refreshing a hoarse throat or weary lungs by some hideous sing-song. But let us now speak about the person on whom advice is not wasted.</p>
<p>Delivery, taken as a whole, is divided, as I said, into two parts, voice and gesture. One appeals to the eye, the other to the ear, the two senses by which all emotion penetrates to the mind. We must first speak about voice, to which gesture also has to conform.</p>
