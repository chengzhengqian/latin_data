<p>Common to all these cases is the feature that the accused do not always defend their action, but often resort to excuses and pleas for pardon. For these are domestic disputes, in which it is sometimes sufficient to secure an acquittal to say that the culprit has only sinned once, or that the act was done in error, or that it is not as bad as is alleged.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Other cases coming under Quality</span></span>
<p>There are also many other types of controversy which fall under Quality.</p>
<p>(1) Assault. Although the accused sometimes denies that he did it, this pleading is usually concerned with the fact and the intention.</p>
<p>(2) Appointment of prosecutor (so-called “divination” proceedings). For this, Cicero,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_255_32" id="target_note_LCL126_255_32"><sup>32</sup></a> who was accusing Verres on the instructions of allied communities, used the following Division: the point to have in mind is what prosecutor is (a) most acceptable to the victims for whom redress is sought, and (b) least acceptable to the accused. The commonest Questions however are: who has the better reason, who is going to bring more energy and vigour to the prosecution, and who will act with more sincerity?</p>
<p>(3) Next, Guardianship. In this type of case, the customary Question is whether the decision should turn on something more than the accounts, and whether the guardian is obliged to ensure not only probity but prudent planning and success.</p>
<p>(4) Maladministration of agency is similar; in the courts it is covered by “management of business”; there is also an action for “breach of instructions.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_255_33" id="target_note_LCL126_255_33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
