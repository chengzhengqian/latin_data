on which the Cause turns. It is this—the Question from which the Issue arises—that I mean here: was it done, what was done, was it rightly done? Hermagoras and Apollodorus and most other writers call these things “Questions” in the strict sense of the word; Theodorus, as I said, calls them General Headings,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_159_2" id="target_note_LCL125_159_2"><sup>2</sup></a> as he calls the minor or dependent Questions “Special Headings.” (It is common ground that one Question may arise out of another and that a species may be divided into other species.) This principal Question, as it were, they then call the <span class="italic">z</span>ē<span class="italic">t</span>ē<span class="italic">ma</span> (Inquiry).</p>
<p>The Line of Defence is the method by which an admitted act is defended. Why should I not use the same example as almost everyone else? “Orestes killed his mother.” This is agreed. He says he did it justifiably. The Issue will be Quality, the Question “whether he did it justifiably,” the Line of Defence that Clytemnestra killed her husband, who was Orestes’ father. This is called the <span class="italic">aition</span> (Motive), and the Point for Decision (the <span class="italic">krinomenon</span>) is whether it was right even for a guilty mother to be killed by her son.</p>
<p>Some have made a distinction between <span class="italic">aition</span> and <span class="italic">aitia,</span> making the one mean the reason why the case came to trial, in this instance the killing of Clytemnestra, and the other the cause alleged by the defence, in this instance the killing of Agamemnon. But there is such lack of agreement about the terminology that some call the cause of the trial <span class="italic">aitia</span> and the cause of the deed <span class="italic">aition,</span> while others reverse the meanings. As for the Latin writers, some call these things respectively <span class="italic">initium</span> (“starting point”) and <span class="italic">ratio</span> (“reason”), others give the same name to both.</p>
<p>One “cause” also is thought to come out of another <span class="italic">(aition ex aitiou).</span> For example: Clytemnestra killed Aga­memnon
