agreed, the Question of intention may arise.</p>
<p>Now to the details. (1) Denial of both act and perpetrator: “I have not committed adultery,” “I have not aimed at becoming tyrant.” In cases of murder and poisoning,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_193_18" id="target_note_LCL126_193_18"><sup>18</sup></a> the following Division is common: “It was not done, and, if it was done, I did not do it.” But when we say (as defendants), “Prove that the man was killed,” this is something only the prosecution has to do, for the defendant can say nothing on the other side except perhaps throw out a few dark hints, which should be scattered around and made as varied as possible, because if you make a single definite assertion, you will have to prove it or risk losing your case. For when the Question lies between our statement and that of our opponent, one or other is bound to seem true; therefore, when the statement on which our defence relies is overthrown, the one which is damaging to us is left. For example, when we are asking about symptoms which point ambiguously either to a stomach illness or to poisoning, there is no third alternative, and therefore both parties stick to their original statements. Sometimes, however, some Arguments are drawn from the circumstances themselves, even without reference to any person, and the question “poison or illness?” is investigated on the basis of the circumstances. For it makes a difference whether the dinner was preceded by &lt;happiness&gt; or sadness, work or leisure, waking or sleeping. The age of the deceased also makes a difference; and it is relevant whether he collapsed suddenly or succumbed to a longer illness. Both sides will have even freer scope for debate if it is simply a sudden death which is in question.</p>
<p>The proof of a fact is sometimes sought in the character of the person, so that it becomes credible that it was poisoning
