<p>There is not much difference, in my opinion, between Judgement and Strategy, except that the former deals with matters which manifest themselves, and the latter with matters which are hidden, and either as yet entirely undiscovered or doubtful. Again, Judgement is most often certain, and Strategy is a sort of reasoning which has deep roots, generally weighs and compares various possibilities, and contains in itself both Invention and the power of judging. But here too you must not expect universal rules, because Strategy depends on circumstances. The place for it is often before the actual pleading (in the prosecution of Verres, Cicero seems to have shown great strategic ability in preferring even to cut down the time allowed him for speaking rather than spill over into the year in which Quintus Hortensius was to be consul). At the same time it is also the first and most important element in the pleading itself. It is Strategy’s business to decide what is to be said, what omitted, and what postponed; whether a denial of the fact or a justification is the best course; whether a Prooemium is to be used and of what kind; whether and in what form there is to be a Narrative; whether the legal question or the question of equity should be treated first; what is the most expedient order, what are the possible “colours”; and whether a harsh, a smooth or even an unpretending style is required. I have given advice on all these matters wherever the context allowed, and I shall do the same in the rest of my work. However, I shall make a few points here, by way of example, to clarify what it is that I think cannot be covered by rules.</p>
