either in voice or in gesture, spoils the whole thing and virtually destroys it. So the fifth place has to be given to Delivery.</p>
<p>We need not listen to those (of whom Albucius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_25_2" id="target_note_LCL125_25_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is one) who claim that there are only the first three parts, on the ground that Memory and Delivery come not from nature, but from art. I shall give instructions in due course on both of these, despite the fact that Thrasymachus held that same view about Delivery.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_25_3" id="target_note_LCL125_25_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Some have added a sixth division, making Judgement come after Invention,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_25_4a" id="target_note_LCL125_25_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> because one has to “invent” first and then “judge.” For my part, I cannot believe that a person who has not made a judgement has performed the act of “invention” either; we do not say that a speaker has “invented” inconsistent, ambivalent, or foolish arguments, but only that he has “failed to avoid” them. Cicero in his <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> does indeed put “judgement” under “Invention”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_25_5" id="target_note_LCL125_25_5"><sup>5</sup></a> but it seems to me that it is so inextricably involved in all the first three parts (neither Disposition nor Elocution could exist without it) that I think Delivery also borrows a great deal from it. I say this with more confidence because Cicero in the <span class="italic">Partitiones oratoriae</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_25_6" id="target_note_LCL125_25_6"><sup>6</sup></a> arrives at the five parts of which I have spoken. For, having first made a division into two—Invention and Elocution—he assigned Content and Disposition to Invention, and Words and Delivery to Elocution, setting up Memory in the fifth place, as the common guardian, as it were, of them all. In the <span class="italic">Orator</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_25_7" id="target_note_LCL125_25_7"><sup>7</sup></a> also, he says that eloquence
