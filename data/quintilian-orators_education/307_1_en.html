other reasons besides brevity. But we must be no less on our guard against the obscurity that comes from compressing everything too much: it is better for there to be too much in a Narrative than too little. Superfluity may be boring, but leaving out essentials is dangerous. We must therefore avoid even the famous “Sallustian brevity”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_243_36" id="target_note_LCL125_243_36"><sup>36</sup></a> (though in Sallust himself it counts as a virtue) and that abrupt sort of language which may perhaps not mislead a leisured reader, but which passes over the head of the hearer and does not wait to be called back. At the same time, readers are as a rule well educated, whereas the courts are often filled with juries sent up from the country,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_243_37" id="target_note_LCL125_243_37"><sup>37</sup></a> who have to give judgement on what they have managed to understand. Consequently, we must aim, perhaps everywhere but particularly in the Narrative, at keeping to the middle road, and saying “as much as is needed and as much as suffices.” By “as much as is needed” I do not mean “the minimum necessary to convey the meaning,” for brevity must not be inelegant, or it would simply show lack of education. For pleasure is in fact beguiling, and things that delight us seem less long, just as a pleasant easy road, even if it is in fact longer, tires us less than a short cut which is hard going and arid. I should never be so keen on brevity as to want to exclude details which make the exposition more credible. If it is simplified and abridged at every point, it may be called a “confession” rather than a Narrative.</p>
<p>Many Narratives, too, are necessarily long because of the actual nature of the facts. With these the last part of the Prooemium should (as I have suggested)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_243_38" id="target_note_LCL125_243_38"><sup>38</sup></a> serve to prepare the judge; we should also make use of every device to
