of humiliation and servility, suggesting hypocrisy, because people use it when they are pretending to flatter, admire, or fear.</p>
<p>A moderate extension of the arm,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_129_53" id="target_note_LCL494_129_53"><sup>53</sup></a> with the shoulders relaxed and the fingers spreading out as the hand is advanced, is a very becoming Gesture for continuous passages that run smoothly. When we have to say something which is particularly impressive and rich—like <span class="italic">saxa atque solitudines voci respondent</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_129_54" id="target_note_LCL494_129_54"><sup>54</sup></a>—the arm sweeps out to the side and the language somehow expands with the Gesture.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Hands</span></span>
<p>As for the hands, without which the Delivery would be crippled and enfeebled, it is almost impossible to say how many movements they possess, for these almost match the entire stock of words. Other parts of the body assist the speaker: the hands, I might almost say, speak for themselves. Do we not use them to demand and promise, summon and dismiss, threaten and beg, show horror and fear, inquire and deny, and also to indicate joy, sadness, doubt, confession, remorse, or again size, quantity, number,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_129_55" id="target_note_LCL494_129_55"><sup>55</sup></a> and time? Do they not excite, restrain, approve, admire, display shame? Do they not serve instead of adverbs and pronouns when we need to point out places or persons? Amid all the linguistic diversity of the peoples and nations of the world, this, it seems to me, is the common language of the human race.</p>
