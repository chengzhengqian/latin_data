avoid this impression is itself a mark of supreme art. This undoubtedly excellent rule is universally taught; nevertheless, the conditions of the times require some modifications to it, since, in some trials, and particularly those concerned with capital charges, and also in the centumviral court, judges have now themselves come to demand meticulous and polished pleadings, and think themselves insulted unless care is apparent also in the oratory; they want not only to be informed, but also to be entertained. It is difficult to strike a happy medium in this; but a possible compromise is to give an impression of polish without too much ingenuity.</p>
<p>The old rule still holds good that no unfamiliar word, no overbold metaphor, no archaism or poeticism should be detected in the Prooemium. At this stage, we are not yet accepted, the attention of the audience is fresh and watchful; when their minds are won over and they are beginning to warm up, they will tolerate this freedom better, especially when we come to commonplaces whose natural richness allows any verbal licence to pass unobserved amid the surrounding brilliance. The style of the Prooemium should be different from that of the Proofs, Commonplaces, and Narrative; it must not however always be finely spun or sophisticated, but often simple and apparently effortless, not promising too much either by the words or by the speaker’s expression. An unobtrusive delivery (what the Greeks call <span class="italic">anepiphantos</span>)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_209_38" id="target_note_LCL125_209_38"><sup>38</sup></a> often worms its way into the mind better. But all this will depend on the extent to which it is expedient to shape the judges’ attitudes.</p>
<p>There is no place in a speech where confusion of memory or loss of fluency is more shaming; a faulty Prooemium
