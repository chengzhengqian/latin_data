<p>Chapter 10, on Arguments, is the longest and most difficult of these chapters. There is first a terminological problem (10.1–11), partly concerned with the terms Enthymeme (<span class="italic">enthymēma</span>) and Epicheireme (<span class="italic">epicheirēma</span>). The first of these terms was used by Aristotle for a rhetorical argument corresponding to the syllogism, and containing either one or two premisses and a conclusion; the second came to cover this type of argument, but was more commonly used for a five-stage argument, in which each of the premisses had to be proved before one proceeded to a conclusion (Solmsen, loc. cit. 169–170). Quintilian knows other uses of these terms, and the terminology was clearly unstable: Demetrius 30–33 provides the nearest parallel in earlier literature to Quintilian’s discussion. Quintilian’s argument itself is analysed in detail by M. F. Burnyeat in D. J. Furley and A. Nehamas, edd., <span class="italic">Aristotle’s Rhetoric: Philosophical Essays</span> (Princeton, 1998) 39–43.</p>
<p>The main part of this chapter (10.20–94) is however concerned with the <span class="italic">loci</span>—“topics,” “places,” “areas,” “sources”—of Arguments. These are “topics” not in the sense of <span class="italic">loci communes,</span> stock arguments about subjects of general interest (witnesses, luxury, or whatever), but in the sense of patterns or models into which any content can be inserted. This again is essentially an inheritance from Aristotle (<span class="italic">Topics, Rhetoric</span> 2.22–23), but with many later refinements and confusions. Lausberg §§ 373–399 covers Quintilian’s ground. Quintilian summarizes his list himself at 5.10.94, before proceeding (95–99) to a discussion of fictitious grounds of argument and some practical considerations.</p>
<p>With 5.11, we turn to “examples” (<span class="italic">paradeigmata</span>), the
