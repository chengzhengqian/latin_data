This is called <span class="italic">metastasis.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_245_16" id="target_note_LCL126_245_16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Excuses of ignorance or compulsion</span></span>
<p>If these moves are ruled out, there remains the Excuse. This may be either (1) ignorance (as when a man brands as a slave a runaway who is afterwards adjudged to be a free man, and then denies that he knew he was free); or (2) necessity (as when a soldier overstays his leave and says he was delayed by floods or by illness).

<p>Finally, there is the plea for mercy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_245_19" id="target_note_LCL126_245_19"><sup>19</sup></a> though most writers have said that this type of Cause never comes into
