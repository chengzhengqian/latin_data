<p>I admit they share the same name. I know too what a complicated and minute controversy there is about them, but this is not relevant to my present purpose, because it makes no difference what either of them is called so long as it is clear what their oratorical uses are. The force of things does not depend on their names. Men are the same if they acquire a different name from what they had before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_15_7" id="target_note_LCL127_15_7"><sup>7</sup></a> and similarly these things we are discussing will have the same effect whether they are called Tropes or Figures. It is their effectiveness, not their name, that makes them useful. In the same way, it makes no difference whether we speak of a Conjectural Issue or an Issue of Denial, of Fact, or of Substance, so long as we know that the basic Question is the same.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_15_8" id="target_note_LCL127_15_8"><sup>8</sup></a> The best thing therefore is to follow received practice in these matters and understand the thing itself, by whatever name it is known. We must note, however, that Trope and Figure are often combined in the same sentence, because metaphorical words can contribute to a Figure just as much as literal ones.</p>

In one, it means any shape in which a thought is expressed—just as our bodies, in whatever pose they are placed, are inevitably in <span class="italic">some</span> sort of attitude.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_15_10a" id="target_note_LCL127_15_10a"><sup>10</sup></a> In the second sense, which is the proper meaning of <span class="italic">schēma,</span> it means a purposeful deviation in sense or language from the ordinary
