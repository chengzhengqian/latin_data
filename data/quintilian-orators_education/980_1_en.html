of protest against this view. “Was not Demosthenes an orator? But we understand he was a bad man. Was not Cicero? Many have found fault with <span class="italic">his</span> morals too.” Well now, what am I to do? I shall have to put up with a lot of prejudice because of my answer; so I must first conciliate my audience. I do not think Demosthenes merits such grave aspersions on his character that I am bound to believe all the charges which are heaped upon him by his enemies; I read also of his noble public policies and his glorious end.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_205_7" id="target_note_LCL494_205_7"><sup>7</sup></a> Nor do I think Ciceroin any way lacked the right attitudes of a good citizen. For evidence, I cite his magnificent consulship, his honourable administration of his province,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_205_8" id="target_note_LCL494_205_8"><sup>8</sup></a> his refusal of a place on the Commission of Twenty,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_205_9" id="target_note_LCL494_205_9"><sup>9</sup></a> and the fact that, in the dreadful civil wars which fell within his lifetime, neither hope nor fear deterred him from supporting the right side, that is to say the Republic. Some think him cowardly: he replied to this charge very well himself, by saying that he was “not a timid person when confronting peril, but timid in foreseeing it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_205_10" id="target_note_LCL494_205_10"><sup>10</sup></a> He proved his point again by his death itself, which he bore with outstanding courage.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_205_11" id="target_note_LCL494_205_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>If these two lacked perfect virtue, I can still answer those who question whether they were orators by the argument the Stoics would use to answer anyone who asked them whether Zeno, Cleanthes, or Chrysippus himself was a Wise Man: they would say that they were great men, and to be venerated, but had not attained to the highest perfection</p>
