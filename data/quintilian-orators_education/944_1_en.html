<p>(1) The commonest Gesture consists of bending the middle finger against the thumb and extending the other three. This is useful (a) in the Prooemium, the hand being moved slightly forwards with a gentle movement to either side, and the head and shoulders gradually following the direction of the hand. It is also (b) an assured Gesture in the Narrative, but then it should extend somewhat further forward, and (c) a Gesture of energy and insistence in reproaches and refutations, because here the hand is extended further and more freely. On the other hand, it is wrong for this movement to be directed (as it often is) sideways, as though aiming at the left shoulder; even worse, some people hold the arm out across the body and make their statement with their elbow.</p>
<p>(2) The two middle fingers can also be turned under the thumb; this is an even more insistent Gesture than the last, and is not suitable for Prooemium or Narrative.</p>
<p>(3) When three fingers are doubled under the thumb, the finger which Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_133_61" id="target_note_LCL494_133_61"><sup>61</sup></a> says Crassus used so well is extended. This finger is important in reproach and in pointing things out (which is why it has its name).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_133_62" id="target_note_LCL494_133_62"><sup>62</sup></a> Turned slightly downwards, with the whole hand raised and turned towards the shoulder, it expresses strong statement; pointed down towards the ground, facing downwards, as it were, it insists on a point. Sometimes also it indicates number.</p>
<p>(4) Again, if the top joint of this finger is gripped lightly on both sides, and the two last fingers are slightly curved (the little finger rather less so), the Gesture is appropriate in arguing a point.</p>
