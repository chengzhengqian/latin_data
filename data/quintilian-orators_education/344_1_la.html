Such a classification goes back, again, to classical Greek rhetoric (<span class="italic">Rhetorica ad Alexandrum</span> 9–13, Aristotle, <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 2.20–25). Aristotle’s account, concerned to show the correspondences between rhetorical and logical argument, is more sophisticated and philosophical than his predecessors’, and indeed than much of what was written later. Our best evidence for Hellenistic rhetoric here is in <span class="italic">De inventione</span> and <span class="italic">Ad Herennium.</span> In <span class="italic">De oratore</span> (2.162–177) and in <span class="italic">Topica</span> (8–78), Cicero went back to Aristotle in many respects. Quintilian’s treatment is, as usual, eclectic, not dependent on any one source. For the background, see especially F. Solmsen, “The Aristotelian Tradition in Ancient Rhetoric,” <span class="italic">American Journal of Philology</span> 62 (1941) 35–50, 169–190 (especially 169–176).</p>
<p>Quintilian begins (5.8) with some principles common to all technical proofs. They may be classified as depending on things or on persons, either in themselves or in relation to others; as resting on Consequences or Contradictions; and as relating to Antecedents, Contemporaneous Events, or Sequels. Some again are of general application, some derive from the particular Cause. Proofs may be “necessary,” “credible,” or just “not contradictory.” Four forms of Proof may be distinguished: A, so not B; A, so B; not A, so B; not A, so not B (Lausberg § 356).</p>
<p>Chapter 9 then proceeds to Signs (<span class="italic">signa, indicia</span>; <span class="italic">sēmeia</span>). These, in Quintilian’s view, are distinct from Arguments and from Examples; they are provided by the circumstances, and the orator’s task is to draw the conclusions from them that his case requires. They are classified as necessary (in Greek <span class="italic">aluta sēmeia, tekmēria</span>), or not necessary (probabilities, Greek <span class="italic">eikota</span>). (Lausberg §§ 358–365; Caplan on <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 2.6.)</p>
