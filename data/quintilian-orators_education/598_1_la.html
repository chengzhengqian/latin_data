over, because Quintilian wants to come on to the “power to amplify and diminish,” which is especially important to the orator.</p>
<p>The capacity “to make small things great and great things small” was indeed a defining characteristic of rhetoric from early times. We may follow ancient usage in calling this Amplification; but it means, of course, exaggeration, not just spending more words on the subject, or expressing it more fully. Background texts include Aristotle, <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 1. 1374b–1375a; “Longinus” 11–12.2; Anonymus Seguierianus 160–165; <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 2.47–49. See Lausberg §§ 400–409. We must note that Quintilian here treats this whole topic under Elocution; but he points out that he has already had occasion to touch on it in the context of Invention (8.3.99). He accordingly begins with choice of words (8.4.1–3), but proceeds to climax-type devices (4.4–9), comparisons, inferences, and “accumulations”—all surely matters of thought, and closely related to the Figures which he will discuss in Book Nine. His aim in 8.4 seems to be to pull together various elements in a topic which he sees as central to the orator’s enterprise as a whole. He is certainly less precise in defining Amplification than, for example, “Longinus” 12.1.</p>
<p>If our interpretation of 8.4.29 (see notes) is sound, the next topic, <span class="italic">sententiae</span> (8.5), is supposed to be a type of verbal Ornament which does not come under any of the heads already discussed, but is demanded by current practice and fashion. It is difficult to translate <span class="italic">sententia</span>: “epigram” does not always satisfy; “sentence” covers only one of its meanings; “thought” (as in Pope, <span class="italic">Essay on Criticism</span> 355, “some unmeaning thing they call a Thought”) would not now be understood; “sound bite” is contemporary and (let
