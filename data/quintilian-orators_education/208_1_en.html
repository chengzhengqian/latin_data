that one ought to take a wife or go into government if one is prevented by age or ill health. But not all Questions of this kind can be objected to in this way: for example “Is virtue an end in itself?” or “Is the world governed by providence?” Moreover, in Questions relating to a particular person, although it is not enough to handle the general Question, we cannot get to the special one unless we have dealt with the other first. For how is Cato to deliberate whether to marry unless it is agreed that men should marry? And how can the question whether he ought to marry Marcia be discussed, unless we have proved that Cato ought to marry? There are however books ascribed to Hermagoras<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_45_13" id="target_note_LCL125_45_13"><sup>13</sup></a> which support the view under discussion; but either the attribution is wrong or the author was some other Hermagoras. For how can they possibly be by the Hermagoras who wrote so much so admirably about Rhetoric, since (as is clear also from the first book of Cicero’s <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span>)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_45_14" id="target_note_LCL125_45_14"><sup>14</sup></a> he divided the subject matter of Rhetoric into Theses and Causes? Cicero there objects to this, and contends that Theses have nothing to do with the orator, and refers all such Questions to the philosophers. But he has relieved me from the embarrassment of answering this by expressing his disapproval of his own book,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_45_15" id="target_note_LCL125_45_15"><sup>15</sup></a> and by teaching us, in <span class="italic">Orator, De oratore,</span> and <span class="italic">Topica,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_45_16" id="target_note_LCL125_45_16"><sup>16</sup></a> to separate our problem from particular persons and occasions, on the ground that we can speak more fully on general matters than on special, and because what has been proved of the whole has necessarily been proved of the part.</p>
