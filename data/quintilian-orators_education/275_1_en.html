the frequent practice of the greatest poets was to invoke the Muses not only at the beginning of their works, but also later on, when they came to some particularly important passage, to repeat their vows and as it were offer up fresh prayers;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_179_5" id="target_note_LCL125_179_5"><sup>5</sup></a> surely then I may be pardoned for doing what I omitted to do when I first began this work, and calling on all the gods to help me, and in the first place on that God<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_179_6" id="target_note_LCL125_179_6"><sup>6</sup></a> than whom no other power gives such present help or looks with more favour on learning; may he inspire me with genius equal to the new expectations he has aroused for me,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_179_7" id="target_note_LCL125_179_7"><sup>7</sup></a> may he be favourable to me and come willingly to my aid, and make me what he has believed me to be!</p>
<p>This is the chief, but not the only, reason for this act of devotion; the work itself, in any case, is advancing in such a way that the themes I now approach are greater and more difficult than those that went before. For the next subject is the layout of forensic Causes, which are particularly various and complex: what is the function of a Prooemium; what are the principles of Narrative; how credibility is achieved in Proofs, either in confirming our own propositions or in demolishing those of our opponents; wherein lies the force of the Epilogue, if we have either to refresh the judge’s memory by a brief recapitulation of the facts, or (much more important) to stir his emotions. Some have chosen to write separately on these individual topics, fearing the burden, as it were, of the system as a whole, and even so have composed numerous books on each one of them. Venturing, as I do, to weave them all into one work, I see ahead of me almost infinite labour; the very thought of my undertaking makes me tired. But, having begun, I must persevere; my strength may fail me, my courage must keep me going.</p>
