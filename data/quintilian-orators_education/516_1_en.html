that nothing hitherto had been done systematically.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_139_1" id="target_note_LCL126_139_1"><sup>1</sup></a> This neglect could indeed still be put right; but if there had been no mistakes, there would have been no grounds for hoping for better things in future. Again, since he feared he might offend if he taxed the people with laziness in defending the liberty of their country, he chose instead to enlarge on the praises of their ancestors, who (he showed) had managed their affairs with very great courage. By this means, he earned a ready hearing, and it followed naturally that in thinking well of those better days they came to repent of their degeneration.</p>
<p>As for Cicero, the <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio</span> alone will supply any number of examples.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_139_2" id="target_note_LCL126_139_2"><sup>2</sup></a> What Strategy should I most admire in it? The initial Narrative, in which he discredited the mother whose authority weighed so heavily upon her son?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_139_3" id="target_note_LCL126_139_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Or his decision to shift the charge of having bribed the jury on to his opponent, rather than deny it, having regard, as he says himself, to the deep-seated infamy of the verdict? Or his postponement, in such an odious case, of his appeal to the law? Such a mode of defence would have set the judges against him had they not been thoroughly softened up first. Or finally, his assertion that he adopted this procedure on his own responsibility against Cluentius’ wishes?</p>
<p>And what of the <span class="italic">Pro Milone</span>?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_139_4" id="target_note_LCL126_139_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Should it be the fact that he postponed the Narrative until he had cleared the defendant of all the prejudice from earlier trials? Or the way in which he threw the odium of the ambush on Clodius, although in fact the fight had been the result of pure chance? Or his way of praising the action and at the same time distancing it from Milo’s intention? Or that he refrained from putting a plea for mercy into Milo’s mouth, but took all that upon himself?</p>
