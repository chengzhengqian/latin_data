Of the greatest orators known up to the present, we can find none without some deficiency or fault. But even those who do not aim for the top have an obligation to compete and not lag behind. The man who tries to win a race may perhaps draw level, even if he does not get into the lead; but no one can draw level with a man in whose footsteps he feels bound to tread. The follower is inevitably always behind.</p>

Total similarity is so difficult to achieve that even Nature herself has failed to prevent things which seem to match and resemble each other most closely from being always distinguishable in <span class="italic">some</span> respect.</p>
<p>(4) Again, whatever resembles another object is bound to be less than what it imitates, just as the shadow is less than the body, the picture less than the face, and the actor’s performance less than the emotions of real life. The same happens in oratory too: the models we choose have their own nature and real force, whereas all imitation is artificial and adapted to another’s purpose. This is why declamations have less life and vigour than actual speeches, because the subject is real in the one case and fictitious in the other.</p>
<p>(5) Again, the greatest qualities of an orator are inimitable: his talent, invention, force, fluency, everything in fact that is not taught in the textbooks. Thus many people think that, if they have picked out some words from speeches or some particular rhythmical feet, they have succeeded wonderfully in reproducing what they have read. Yet (a) words lose or gain currency with the times, because the surest rule for them is usage,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_327_4" id="target_note_LCL127_327_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and they are not good or bad
