The best exercise is to speak every day before a considerable audience, if possible of people about whose judgement and good opinion we feel anxious. It is rare for anyone to have enough respect for himself as a critic, but let us by all means speak by ourselves rather than not speak at all. Yet another exercise consists in thinking the speech out, and going over the whole of the material in silence (so long as one speaks to oneself, as it were). This can be done at any time and anywhere, when we are not otherwise occupied, and it is in some respects of 〈greater〉 utility than the last exercise, because it involves more careful composition than a procedure in which we are afraid of breaking the thread of what we are saying. On the other hand the first method is more valuable for other things: strength of voice, fluent utterance, and body language, which (as I said) itself acts as a stimulus to the orator and encourages him, as he waves his arms or stamps his feet, in the way that lions are said to use their tails.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_385_11" id="target_note_LCL127_385_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
