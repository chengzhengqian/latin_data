personally were faced with the necessity of responding. If this is not possible, let us put on one side whatever first comes to mind and say to ourselves, “Suppose this were not so,” and do this a second and a third time, and go on until there is nothing left. We shall therefore also be examining subordinate points, dealing with which will help to make the judge more responsive to us over the main Question. A similar point is made by the advice to “proceed from the common to the particular,” because what is “common” is, as a rule, “general.” Common: “killed a tyrant.” Particular: “killed a tyrant husband.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_167_17a" id="target_note_LCL126_167_17a"><sup>17</sup></a> Again, “a woman killed him”: “his wife killed him.”</p>
<p>I also used to note down what were my areas of agreement with my opponent, if they were favourable to me, and not only to insist on his admitting them, but to subdivide and so multiply them. Take for example the following <span class="italic">controversia</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_167_18" id="target_note_LCL126_167_18"><sup>18</sup></a> “A general, who had defeated his father in an election in which he was a candidate, was taken prisoner; the envoys going to ransom him met the father returning from the enemy. He said to them, ‘You are too late.’ They searched the father and found gold on his person. They then continued on their way, and found the general on the cross. He said, ‘Beware of a traitor.’ The father is now put on trial.” What is common ground? “We had warning of treachery, and warning from the general.” We are looking for the traitor. “You admit that you went to the enemy, that you went secretly and returned safely, and that you brought back gold, and kept it hidden.” For what is agreed is sometimes specially effective in the prosecution
