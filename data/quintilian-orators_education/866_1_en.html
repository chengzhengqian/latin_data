court or others (so long as they are real) and argue both sides, thus training himself, as we see gladiators do, with real weapons, just as I said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_367_22" id="target_note_LCL127_367_22"><sup>22</sup></a> Brutus did in his “defence” of Milo. This is better than writing replies to old speeches, as Cestius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_367_23" id="target_note_LCL127_367_23"><sup>23</sup></a> did to Cicero’s speech for the same defendant, although he could not know the other side of the case sufficiently from the defence alone.</p>
<p>The young man will become competent more quickly if his teacher (1) forces him to stick as close as possible to real life in his declamations, and (2) makes him treat all the aspects of his theme, and not, as they do these days, select only the easiest and most attractive parts. There are obstacles to my second suggestion due to the large number of pupils, the practice of hearing classes on particular days, and (to some extent) the attitude of parents, who count their sons’ declamations rather than judge them.</p>
<p>But, as I said (I think) in Book One,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_367_24" id="target_note_LCL127_367_24"><sup>24</sup></a> our good teacher will not burden himself with a larger number of pupils than he can handle, and he will cut out all excessive verbosity, so that everything relevant to the theme is said, but not (as some seem to want) everything in the whole wide world. In addition, he will prefer either to make the requirement of speaking come round at longer intervals, or else to let them divide the material.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_367_25a" id="target_note_LCL127_367_25a"><sup>25</sup></a> 〈One theme〉 thoroughly executed will be more use than several half finished, or of which we are just given a taste, as it were. The result of allowing incomplete work is that nothing gets into its proper place, and the opening section does not even observe its own rules, because the youngsters gather up choice bits
