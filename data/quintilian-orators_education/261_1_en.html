to a conclusion; so why, if Proposition is a “part” of the Cause, is not the same true of Conclusion? Partition, on the other hand, is an aspect of Disposition, and Disposition is a Part of Rhetoric<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_151_1" id="target_note_LCL125_151_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and is evenly distributed throughout all themes and their entire organization, just like Invention and Elocution. Partition therefore should be regarded not simply as a part of the speech as a whole, but also as a part of the individual Questions. For what Question is there in which the orator cannot promise what he is going to say first, second, and third? And this is the special function of Partition. How ridiculous it is, therefore, to make a Question an aspect of the Proof, but to call a Partition, which is an aspect of the Question, a “part” of the speech as a whole! As for Digression (<span class="italic">egressio,</span> or <span class="italic">excessus,</span> as it has begun to be called more commonly),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_151_2" id="target_note_LCL125_151_2"><sup>2</sup></a> if it is outside the Cause it cannot be a part of the Cause, and if it is in the Cause it is an auxiliary or embellishment of the parts of the Cause from which it digresses. For if anything that is in the Cause is to be called a “part” of it, why are not Argument, Comparison, Commonplace, Emotional Appeal, and Examples called “parts” also? On the other hand, I disagree with those, like Aristotle,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_151_3" id="target_note_LCL125_151_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who take away Refutation, on the ground that it is subordinate to Proof; for Proof is meant to establish something, and Refutation to pull something down. Aristotle also makes a slight innovation in making the Proposition, rather than the Narrative, come next to the Prooemium. He does this because he treats Proposition as a genus of which Narrative is a species, and he believes that the latter is not always necessary, while the former is necessary always and everywhere.</p>
