us hope) ephemeral. French is luckier than English: <span class="italic">trait</span> serves quite well. The word corresponds roughly to Greek <span class="italic">gnōmē</span> (so 8.5.3), which means a concisely expressed general sentiment, but also to <span class="italic">epiphōnēma</span> (see 8.5.11), a sort of “punch line.” The <span class="italic">thing</span> is of course a staple of all rhetorical and declamatory literature: see M. Winterbottom’s Introduction to Seneca’s <span class="italic">Controversiae</span> (LCL), xv–xvii; J. de Decker, <span class="italic">Juvenalis declamans</span> (1913), 154–172; Lausberg §§ 872–879, and his Index. Quintilian’s historical account and classification (esp. 5.15–25) seem original, and his plea for moderation (5.25–34) is in tune with his customary views.</p>
<p>“Tropes,” the subject of 8.6, form an important part both of the rhetor’s instruction and of that of the <span class="italic">grammaticus.</span> Background material is extensive: note especially Demetrius 78–90 (with Schenkeveld (1964) 88ff.), <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 4.42–46, Trypho in Spengel, <span class="italic">Rhetores Graeci</span> 3. 191–206 (better edited by M. L. West, <span class="italic">Classical Quarterly</span> 1965, 230–248) and other similar treatises in the same volume of Spengel; and above all [Plutarch] <span class="italic">Life and Poetry of Homer</span> (hereafter <span class="italic">VPH;</span> ed. J. F. Kindstrand (1990), commentary by M. Hillgruber (1994–1998)), though this text has only eight kinds of trope, as against Quintilian’s and Trypho’s fourteen. Summary of evidence in Lausberg §§ 552–598; Volkmann 415–442 (lucid and sensible). Recent discussions by G. O. Rowe, <span class="italic">CRHP</span> 124–129, G. Calboli, <span class="italic">Rhetorica</span> 16 (1998) 56–80. W. G. Rutherford’s <span class="italic">A Chapter in the History of Annotation</span> (1905) 183–369 remains worth consulting, despite his (perhaps justifiably) low opinion of Quintilian’s “muddy” discussion.</p>
