by a brief intervention from the defending advocate rather than by an interrogation, (3) (if the chance presents itself) discomfited by some witty observation, or (4) destroyed by the scandal of his offences, if anything can be brought against his way of life. It has proved useful to show restraint in attacking honest and modest witnesses, because people who would have fought back against an onslaught are often mollified by courtesy.</p>
<p>Every interrogation is concerned either (1) with matters within the Cause or (2) with something outside the Cause.</p>
<p>(1) Within the Cause. As we suggested to the prosecution,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_349_9" id="target_note_LCL125_349_9"><sup>9</sup></a> the defending advocate, by beginning his questioning far back, in an area where there is nothing to suspect, and then setting the earlier answers against the later ones, often brings the witnesses to the point where he can extract from them whatever helps him against their will. There is of course no systematic teaching or practice of this skill in the schools,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_349_10" id="target_note_LCL125_349_10"><sup>10</sup></a> and excellence in it depends more on natural acumen and experience. But if one has to propose a model for imitation, the only one is that which can be found in the dialogues of the Socratics, and especially Plato.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_349_11" id="target_note_LCL125_349_11"><sup>11</sup></a> Here there are such shrewd interrogations that, even if most of the answers are good, the conclusion is the one the questioners want to elicit. Fortune is sometimes kind enough to us to let a witness say something inconsistent with his own statement; more often, witnesses contradict one another. An acute interrogation, however, will achieve by method the result commonly attained by chance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_349_12" id="target_note_LCL125_349_12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
