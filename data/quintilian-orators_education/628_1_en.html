an extremely neat piece of advice on this subject: “Be the first to criticize your own exaggeration.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_363_54" id="target_note_LCL126_363_54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>(3) Metaphor can only be justified by reference to the context. So enough has now been said about individual words, which, as I have shown elsewhere,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_363_55" id="target_note_LCL126_363_55"><sup>55</sup></a> have no virtue of their own. They are not however without ornamental quality, unless they are beneath the dignity of the subject on which we have to speak—obscenities set out in crude terms are of course an exception. I say this to warn those who do not think it necessary to avoid obscenity, on the ground that no word is shocking in itself and that, if the thing meant is disgusting, it comes to be understood by whatever name it is called.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_363_56" id="target_note_LCL126_363_56"><sup>56</sup></a> For my part, I shall content myself with our modest Roman ways, and follow the tactful procedure of answering such speakers by silence.</p>

<p>Let us now pass to the principles of connected discourse. The primary division of Ornament here is into our mental conception of the expression needed and our actual production of it. The first thing is that it should be clear whether we wish to enhance or attenuate, to speak vigorously or calmly, in rich or austere terms, at length or concisely, harshly or gently, grandly or plainly, with gravity or with wit. Secondly, we have to discover what type of metaphor, what Figures, what sort of <span class="italic">sententiae,</span> what means,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_363_57a" id="target_note_LCL126_363_57a"><sup>57</sup></a> and, finally, what word arrangement is needed to effect our purpose.</p>
