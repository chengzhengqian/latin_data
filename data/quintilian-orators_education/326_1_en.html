couch, and the other women were lying on the floor
all around. Half dead with terror, and aware now
of the enemy’s approach, they tried to rouse up Antonius;
they shouted his name, and tried in vain to
hoist him up by his neck; some whispered blandishments
in his ear, one or two gave him an energetic
slap. He recognized all their voices and their touch,
and tried to put his arms round the neck of whoever
was nearest to him. He was too much aroused to
sleep, and too drunk to stay awake; dazed and half-asleep,
he was thrown around in the arms of his centurions
and his concubines.

<p>I must not omit to mention too the credibility which the personal authority of the narrator lends to his story. We have to earn this, primarily, by our life, but also by our style; the more serious and dignified this is, the more weight it is bound to lend to our assertions. It is therefore particularly important in this part of the speech to avoid any suggestion of excessive ingenuity. The judge is nowhere more on his guard than here. There must be no feeling of insincerity or excessive care. Everything must seem to come from the Cause, not from the orator. Yet we find this intolerable, and we think our art is wasted unless it can be seen, when the truth is that it ceases to be art once it is detected!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_281_81" id="target_note_LCL125_281_81"><sup>81</sup></a> We are addicted to applause, and think it the goal of all our labour. And so the exhibition we want to make for the audience turns into an indiscreet disclosure to the judges.</p>
