<h2>Marcus Fabius Quintilianus to his friend Trypho<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_51_1" id="target_note_LCL124_51_1"><sup>1</sup></a>: greeting</h2>
<p class="noindent">You have been pressing me every day, with great insistence, to start publishing the books on “the orator’s education” which I had written for my friend Marcellus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_51_2" id="target_note_LCL124_51_2"><sup>2</sup></a> My own view was that they had not yet matured enough. As you know, I spent little more than two years on composing them, at a time when I was anyway distracted by much business. The time has been spent not so much on the actual writing as on the research required by a work of almost infinite scope, and on reading the countless authorities. Since then, following the advice of Horace, who, in the <span class="italic">Ars Poetica,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_51_3" id="target_note_LCL124_51_3"><sup>3</sup></a> urges that publication should not be hurried but “kept in store till the ninth year comes round,” I have been giving them a rest, to let my satisfaction in my own productions cool, so as to go over them again more carefully, with a reader’s eyes. But if they are called for as urgently as you allege, let us spread our sails before the wind and pray for a good voyage as we cast off. But it depends very much on your own loyal care also to see that they come into people’s hands in as correct a form as possible. Farewell.</p>
