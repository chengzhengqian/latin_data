<p>Finally, <span class="italic">ēthos</span> in all its forms requires a good and eventempered person. Since the orator needs to demonstrate these qualities, if he can, in his client too, he must at any rate possess, or be thought to possess, them himself. He will thus do the best service to his Causes, as his own good character will lend them credibility. For the man who seems bad when he speaks must inevitably speak badly [for he does not seem to be saying what is just, and even if he did, it would not seem to be <span class="italic">ēthos</span>]. Hence the actual style of all this should be calm and gentle. It needs no pride, and certainly no elevation or sublimity.

To indicate the difference by the closest parallel I can, let me say that the one is nearer to comedy, and the other to tragedy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_55_5" id="target_note_LCL126_55_5"><sup>5</sup></a> <span class="italic">Pathos</span> is almost entirely concerned with anger, hatred, fear, envy, and pity. The topics from which these can be derived are obvious to all, and I have given them in connection with the Prooemium and the Epilogue.</p>
<p>Fear, however, is to be understood in two ways: fear which we feel and fear which we cause in others. Likewise envy: one kind makes a person “envious,” the other “invidious,” though the first applies rather to persons and the second &lt;also&gt; to things; it is with the latter that oratory has
