long and two shorts, the Anapaest has the same time units but in the reverse order. A short between two longs will form an Amphimacron (more often called a Cretic), a long between two shorts an Amphibrach. 〈Two longs following a short gives a Bacchius〉; its opposite, two longs preceding a short, is a Palimbacchius. Three shorts will make a Trochee, though this is called a Tribrach by those who use the term Trochee for the Choreus. Three longs will make a Molossus. All these feet come into prose; but the more time units they each occupy, and the more stability they receive from long syllables, the weightier they make the style; the short feet, on the other hand, make it rapid and nimble. Both are useful in their place; the former are properly rejected as slow and heavy when speed is wanted, the latter, equally properly, as abrupt and jerky where the need is for weight. It is also perhaps of some importance that some long syllables are longer than other longs, and some short syllables shorter than other shorts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_207_79a" id="target_note_LCL127_207_79a"><sup>79</sup></a> Thus, although syllables may be thought never to cover more than two time units or less than one, and although, in metre, all shorts and longs are equal to all other shorts and longs, there is nevertheless some concealed excess or deficiency in relation to the norm. Verse indeed has its own rules, and therefore in verse there are also some syllables which are common.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_207_80" id="target_note_LCL127_207_80"><sup>80</sup></a> But how can the real facts allow a vowel to be short or long, both when it is on its own and when one or more consonants precede it? At any rate, in measuring
