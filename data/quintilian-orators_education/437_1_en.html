<p>The best kind of Enthymeme, however, seems to be one in which a Reason is combined with a Dissimilar or Contrary Statement, as here in Demosthenes:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_503_7" id="target_note_LCL125_503_7"><sup>7</sup></a> “For if at any time an act was committed contrary to law, and you copied it, it does not follow that you ought to go free of punishment; on the contrary, there is all the more reason why you should be condemned. For, just as you would not have made this proposal if one of them had been condemned, so, if you are condemned, no one else will make such a proposal in future.”</p>
<p>The Epicheireme, according to various writers, has four or five or even six parts. Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_503_8a" id="target_note_LCL125_503_8a"><sup>8</sup></a> supports the view that there are at most five: Major Premiss and its Reason, Minor Premiss and its Proof, and finally Conclusion (<span class="italic">complexio</span>). But since sometimes the Major Premiss does not need a Reason, or the Minor Premiss a Proof, and sometimes too there is no need for a Conclusion, the reasoning process may consist of only four, three or even two parts. Nevertheless, I, like most authorities, believe that there are at most three. For the nature of things requires that there should be a subject of inquiry and a means of proving it; the third element which may be added results (as it were) from the agreement of the first two: so we have (1) the Major Premiss, (2) the Minor Premiss, (3) the Conclusion (<span class="italic">conexio</span>). The Confirmation and the development of the first two can come under the parts to which they belong.</p>
<p>Let us take an example of the five parts from Cicero: “‘Things that are controlled by design are better governed
