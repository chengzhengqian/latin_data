writers, content to take excerpts from Plato’s <span class="italic">Gorgias,</span> unwisely selected by their predecessors, and not reading the whole dialogue or his other works, have fallen into the great error of supposing that Plato believed that rhetoric was not an art but “a certain expertise in charm and pleasure,” and (from another passage) “the shadow of a part of politics” and “the fourth type of flattery.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_363_29" id="target_note_LCL124_363_29"><sup>29</sup></a> (Plato assigns two parts of “politics” to the body, medicine and gymnastics (they translate this as <span class="italic">exercitatrix</span>), and two to the mind, law and justice; he makes cookery a form of “flattery of medicine,” the expertise of the slave-dealers “flattery of gymnastics,” because they use paint to fake colour and useless fat to fake real strength, and similarly sophistry “flattery of law,” and rhetoric “flattery of justice.”) Now all this is indeed written in this dialogue, and spoken by Socrates, in whose person Plato appears to represent his own views. But some of his dialogues were composed to refute opponents, and these are called “elenctic” dialogues, while others are for teaching, and are called “dogmatic.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_363_30a" id="target_note_LCL124_363_30a"><sup>30</sup></a> Now Socrates (or Plato) applies this description to rhetoric as practised in those days, for he speaks explicitly of “this way in which you conduct public affairs,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_363_31" id="target_note_LCL124_363_31"><sup>31</sup></a> but he has an understanding of true and honourable rhetoric.
