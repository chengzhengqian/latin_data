Cicero, talking of Antony’s luxury, have invented the level of extravagance which he manages to indicate by saying “You might see beds in his slaves’ quarters covered with Pompey’s purple bedspreads”?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_405_19" id="target_note_LCL126_405_19"><sup>19</sup></a> Purple bedspreads—Pompey’s purple bedspreads—slept on by slaves, and in their own quarters! Nothing can be said to cap this, and yet one is bound to infer that there was infinitely more luxury in the master! This is rather like what is called Emphasis; but Emphasis is a matter of suggestive words, and this of suggestive things; it is therefore the more potent, inasmuch as things carry more weight than words.</p>
<p>(4) Accumulation of words and sentences having the same meaning may also be reckoned as Amplification. For even though there is no step-by-step ascent, the facts are raised by being piled up, as it were: “What was that sword of yours doing, Tubero, the sword you drew on the field of Pharsalus? At whose body was that blade pointed? What was the meaning of your appearing under arms? What did you intend? What were your eyes, your hand, your brave heart doing? What did you want?

This accumulation also often shows a rising pattern, when every word marks a step in an ascending series: “There stood the doorkeeper of the prison, the praetor’s executioner, the death and terror of the allies and citizens of Rome, lictor Sextius.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_405_22" id="target_note_LCL126_405_22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The principle of Attenuation is much the same, as there are just as many steps going down as going up. I shall therefore content myself with a single example, the passage where Cicero speaks of Rullus’ speech: “A few, who stood
