to one—but the principle is in part the same in both; for nothing which can be said in the challenge cannot also be said in the riposte. There are however some features peculiar to replies. The remarks of the challenger tend to be prepared and thought out beforehand, whereas the response is generally improvised in the course of the debate or the examination of witnesses.</p>
<p>But though there are many areas from which jokes may be drawn, I must emphasize again that they are not all suitable for orators: in particular any kind of <span class="italic">double entendre,</span> either the obscure variety, pursued in Atellan fashion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_87_38" id="target_note_LCL126_87_38"><sup>38</sup></a> or the vulgar sort which the lowest of the low bandy around, and in which the ambiguity commonly turns into abuse, or even the kind which sometimes escaped from Cicero’s lips, though never in court: for example, when a candidate, said to be the son of a cook (<span class="italic">coquus</span>), solicited someone else’s vote in his presence, Cicero said “I too (<span class="italic">quoque</span>)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_87_39" id="target_note_LCL126_87_39"><sup>39</sup></a> will support you.” I do not mean that words that have a double meaning should be banned altogether, but they rarely fit the situation neatly, unless they are decisively supported by the actual facts. So not only this, but also the remark [of Cicero] against Isauricus, whom I mentioned above<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_87_40" id="target_note_LCL126_87_40"><sup>40</sup></a>—”I wonder why your father, a man of unvarying steadiness, left us someone like you, so variously coloured”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_87_41" id="target_note_LCL126_87_41"><sup>41</sup></a>—is almost scurrilous. On the other hand the following example of this type is really very good indeed: when Milo’s accuser, in order to prove that he had ambushed Clodius, alleged
