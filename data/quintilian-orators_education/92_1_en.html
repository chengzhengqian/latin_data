<p>Finally, the most powerful proofs are commonly called “linear demonstrations.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_233_39" id="target_note_LCL124_233_39"><sup>39</sup></a> And what is the aim of oratory if not proof? Geometry also uses reasoning to detect falsehoods which appear like truths. This also happens with numbers, by means of the so-called “pseudographs”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_233_40a" id="target_note_LCL124_233_40a"><sup>40</sup></a> which we used to amuse ourselves with as boys. There are other more important points. Who would not believe the following proposition? “When the lines bounding two figures are equal in length, the areas contained by these lines must also be equal.” But it is false, for everything depends on the shape of the figure, and historians have been taken to task by geometers for thinking that the size of islands is given by the length of the circumnavigation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_233_41" id="target_note_LCL124_233_41"><sup>41</sup></a> In fact, the more perfect the shape, the greater the area it contains. So, if the boundary line is a circle, which is the most perfect plane figure, it will enclose a larger area than a square, and a square will enclose more than a triangle, and an equilateral triangle more than one with unequal sides.</p>
<p>Other aspects of this may be rather obscure, but let me take an example which is easy even for the inexpert. Almost everyone knows than a <span class="italic">iugerum</span> is 240 feet long and 120 feet broad,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_233_42" id="target_note_LCL124_233_42"><sup>42</sup></a> and its perimeter and the area of ground enclosed are easily calculated. But a square of 180 feet gives the same perimeter, but a much larger area enclosed</p>
