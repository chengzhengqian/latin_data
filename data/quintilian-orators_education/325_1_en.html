I should not wish either to discourage stimulating the judge’s jaded appetite with a clever thought, preferably in the form of a brief comment (as in “Milo’s slaves did what anyone would have wished his own slaves to do in such a situation”)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_279_77" id="target_note_LCL125_279_77"><sup>77</sup></a> but occasionally in a rather freer manner: “Mother-in-law marries son-in-law; no auspices, no witnesses, omens all dark.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_279_78" id="target_note_LCL125_279_78"><sup>78</sup></a> If this was done even in the days when every speech was designed for use rather than for show and the courts had stricter principles, how much more should we do it now, when pleasure has forced its way in even where life or fortune is in jeopardy?
