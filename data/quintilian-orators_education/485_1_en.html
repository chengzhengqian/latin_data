seeking a laugh: nothing is less witty than what is spoken as witty. Still, although the speaker’s gravity adds greatly to the charm, and the words raise a laugh just because he does not laugh, there is also, on occasion, a look, an expression of the face, or a gesture which is not without urbanity, so long as proper limits have been observed.</p>

It is allowable sometimes to attack an opponent with insults and hard words, seeing that it is also permitted to make accusations openly, and legitimately demand a capital sentence. Yet even here, attacking someone’s fortune generally seems inhumane, either because it is not the person’s fault, or because this may all recoil on the attackers.
