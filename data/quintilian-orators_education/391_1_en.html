<p>for instance, “Those who do a just thing are acting justly” (which surely needs no Proof), or “Common grazing may be grazed in common.”</p>
<p>Some call the Arguments which we have described as based on reasons or efficient causes by the foreign name <span class="italic">ekbasis,</span> that is “outcome.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_411_81" id="target_note_LCL125_411_81"><sup>81</sup></a> For here too the only point considered is what comes out of each individual thing.</p>
<p>(8) Arguments which prove the lesser from the greater, the greater from the lesser, or equals from equals, are called Apposite or Comparative Arguments.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_411_82" id="target_note_LCL125_411_82"><sup>82</sup></a> A Conjecture is confirmed (a) “from the greater”: “If anyone commits sacrilege, he will also commit theft,” (b) “from the lesser”: “A man who lies easily and openly will also commit perjury,” (c) “from equals”: “A man who has taken a bribe to give a judgement will also take one to give false witness.” A legal point is confirmed (a) “from the greater”: “If it is lawful to kill an adulterer, it is lawful to flog him”; (b) “from the lesser”: “If it is lawful to kill a nocturnal thief, what about a violent robber?” (c) “from equals”: “The punishment which is just for a parricide is also just for a matricide.” The basis of the treatment of all these is Syllogism. In Issues of Definition and Quality, the following Arguments are more useful: “If strength is good for the body, health is no less so”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_411_83" id="target_note_LCL125_411_83"><sup>83</sup></a> “If theft is a crime, sacrilege is a greater one”; “If abstinence is a virtue, so is continence”; “If the world is governed by providence, the state must be governed”; “If a house cannot be built without a plan, what of &lt;a whole city?”&gt; “If we must guard naval stores, so must we stores of arms.”</p>
