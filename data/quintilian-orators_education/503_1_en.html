<p>The most agreeable examples of all these types are the relaxed and, so to speak, good-tempered ones. Afer again: an ungrateful client avoided him in the forum, and he sent his attendant<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_113_101" id="target_note_LCL126_113_101"><sup>101</sup></a> to him to say “Are you grateful to me for not having seen you?” And when his steward failed to pay back the balance on his account and kept saying “I didn’t eat it; I live on bread and water,” Afer said “Sparrow, pay what you owe.” They call such things “innuendo.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_113_102" id="target_note_LCL126_113_102"><sup>102</sup></a> A joke which reproaches a person less than it might is well received. Afer again: a candidate said “I have always respected your family”; Afer could well have denied it openly, but he said “I believe it as if it was true.”</p>
