<p>There are accidental features of pronunciation, which cannot be shown in writing, being faults of the mouth and the tongue. The Greeks, who are more fertile than we are in inventing names, call them iotacisms, lambdacisms, <span class="italic">ischnotētes</span> and <span class="italic">plateiasmoi,</span> and also <span class="italic">koilostomia,</span> when the voice seems to come from the back of the mouth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_141_41a" id="target_note_LCL124_141_41a"><sup>41</sup></a> There are also certain special, indescribable sounds, by which we sometimes recognize particular nations.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_141_42" id="target_note_LCL124_141_42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>If all these faults which I have described have been removed, we have what is called Orthoepy, “rightness of speech,” that is to say, a correct and agreeable articulation of words: this is what “right” pronunciation can be taken to mean.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Solecism</span></span>
<p>All other faults involve more words than one, including Solecism, though there has been some controversy on this point too. Even those who admit that it occurs in connected speech contend that the fault is in a word and not in the context, on the ground that it can be put right by correcting a single word. Whether <span class="italic">amarae corticis</span> or <span class="italic">medio cortice</span> is a solecism in gender (personally I object to neither,</p>

In any case, it is a fault, and presumably a fault in <span class="italic">Latin. Mutacismus,</span> which Claussen proposed to add, is some feature of the pronunciation of final <span class="italic">m. Labdacismus</span> is also obscure, and Latin grammarians give no clear account. One would suppose it to be a faulty pronunciation of <span class="italic">l,</span> or the lisping replacement of <span class="italic">r</span> by <span class="italic">l (traulismos),</span> satirized by Aristophanes (<span class="italic">Wasps</span> 44). The other terms—“thinnesses,” “broadnesses,” “hollow mouth”—are more easily understood. As often, the use of Greek terms in a Latin context produces difficulties.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL124_141_41a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL124_141_42"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL124_141_42" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">42</sup>Here however we seem to have a comment on local and provincial types of Latin, though Greek may still be in mind.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL124_141_42').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
