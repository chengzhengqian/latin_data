<p>ancestors did not neglect music, in so far as that age allowed. Finally, there is a well-known Greek proverb that says that “the uneducated are far away from the Muses and the Graces.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_225_25" id="target_note_LCL124_225_25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>But let us discuss the advantages which the future orator in particular may derive from music.</p>
<p>Music has patterns of two kinds, in sounds and in the movement of the body, for both need proper control of some kind. The musical theorist Aristoxenus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_225_26" id="target_note_LCL124_225_26"><sup>26</sup></a> divides what concerns sound into rhythm <span class="italic">(rhythmos)</span> and melody <span class="italic">(melos),</span> the former comprising the “modulation,” and the latter the tone and the quality of the sound. Now are not <span class="italic">all</span> these essential to the orator? One point is relevant to gesture, the second to word arrangement, and the third to the inflexions of the voice, many of which are also involved in making a speech. Or do you imagine that some kind of structure and euphonious combination of sounds is necessary only for poetry or the sung parts of plays,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_225_27a" id="target_note_LCL124_225_27a"><sup>27</sup></a> and not essential in pleading? Or that oratory does not employ various kinds of Composition and sounds according to the needs of the subject just as music does? Music indeed employs sound and modulation, to express sublime thoughts loftily, pleasing thoughts with sweetness, and ordinary thoughts with easy grace; it uses all its skill to accord with the emotions required by the words it accompanies. Yet in oratory too, raising, lowering, or inflecting the voice is a means of affecting the hearers’ feelings; we use one “modulation” (if I may use the same term) of phrasing and of voice to arouse the judge’s indignation and a different
