<p>and inventing him; so shall I not have the courage to say that, in the eternity of time to come, there may possibly be found something more perfect than anything which went before? I pass over people who do not give enough credit even for eloquence to Cicero and Demosthenes, although it is true that Cicero himself finds imperfections in Demosthenes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_209_17" id="target_note_LCL494_209_17"><sup>17</sup></a> and says he sometimes “nods,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_209_18" id="target_note_LCL494_209_18"><sup>18</sup></a> and Cicero himself does not seem perfect either to Brutus and Calvus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_209_19" id="target_note_LCL494_209_19"><sup>19</sup></a> (who criticize his Composition to his face) or to the two Asinii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_209_20" id="target_note_LCL494_209_20"><sup>20</sup></a> who make really hostile attacks on the faults of his style in various places.</p>

By the same token, I shall not allow everyone who is ready with his hands to be a brave man, because courage cannot be conceived apart from virtue. If a man who is called upon to defend a Cause needs (as he surely does) a loyalty which greed cannot corrupt, influence affect, or fear break down, are we to give the sacred name of orator to a traitor, a deserter, or a colluder? If the quality which is commonly called goodness is thought right even for mediocre advocates, why should not the ideal orator, who has never existed but may exist some day, be perfect in character as well as in oratory? The man I am educating is no law-court hack or hired voice, nor even (let us avoid hard words) a serviceable case advocate, what is commonly called a <span class="italic">causidicus</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_209_21" id="target_note_LCL494_209_21"><sup>21</sup></a> but a man of outstanding natural talent who has acquired a profound knowledge of many</p>
