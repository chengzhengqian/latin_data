<p>I am not attracted (if I may disagree with great authorities)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_223_126" id="target_note_LCL127_223_126"><sup>126</sup></a> by the Paean which consists of three shorts and a long (it is an Anapaest with one extra short): <span class="italic">făcĭlĭtās, ăgĭlĭtās.</span> I do not see why they like it so much, except that those who approved of it were in general people who studied ordinary speech rather than public oratory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_223_127" id="target_note_LCL127_223_127"><sup>127</sup></a> It favours the short syllable of a Pyrrhic or Choreus preceding it: <span class="italic">mĕă făcĭlĭtās, nōstră făcĭlĭtās,</span> and with a Spondee to precede it it forms the latter part of a trimeter [which indeed it is even on its own].

<p>My purpose in dealing with this whole subject is not to force oratory, which ought to move and flow freely, to grow old and weary measuring feet and weighing syllables. That is for mean minds, obsessed with trivialities. The man who devotes all his energies to this will have no time for more important things, because he will be forgetting the weight-iness of his subject, despising elegance, and, as Lucilius
