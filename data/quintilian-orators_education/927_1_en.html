on a sunny, windy, wet, or warm day? As for the warning which some think necessary, not to speak if you have indigestion or have overeaten or are drunk or have just vomited—no sane person surely would 〈so much as〉 declaim in such a condition!</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is good reason for the advice, universally given, to spare the voice as much as possible in the transition from boyhood to adolescence, because at that stage it has natural difficulties—not, I fancy, because of heat, as some have thought (there is more heat at other periods), but rather because of the moisture which swells up at that age.
