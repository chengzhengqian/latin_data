Gaius Considius.” But how does Cicero put it? “Quintus Ligarius, when there was no hint of war, went out to Africa as legate to Gaius Considius.” And elsewhere: “Not only to no war, but to not the slightest hint of war.” And when it would have been clear enough for the purpose of giving information to say “Quintus Ligarius did not allow himself to be implicated in any scheme,” he added “because his mind was on home, and he wanted to get back to his people.” In this way Cicero both made his statement credible by giving a reason, and also filled it with emotion.</p>
<p>This makes me all the more surprised at those who think emotion is not to be used in Narrative. If they mean “not for long, and not as in the Epilogue,” they are agreeing with me; for we must avoid prolixity. But why should I not want to move the judge while I am instructing him? Why should I not, if possible, pursue the object I am to seek in the last part of my pleading, right from the opening stages—especially as I shall find him more amenable during my Proofs if he is already possessed by anger or pity? Does not Cicero, when he describes the flogging of a Roman citizen,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_275_73" id="target_note_LCL125_275_73"><sup>73</sup></a> move every emotion in a very few words, not only by emphasizing the victim’s standing, the scene of the outrage, and the sort of flogging, but also by praising the man’s courage? He shows us a hero who, when beaten with rods, neither groaned nor begged for mercy, but only cried out that he was a Roman citizen, to the disgrace of his executioner, and so showed his confidence in the law. Again, take the misfortunes of Philodamus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_275_74" id="target_note_LCL125_275_74"><sup>74</sup></a> Does not Cicero both fan the flame of indignation throughout his account, and fill our eyes with tears at the moment of punishment, when he describes, or rather sets before our eyes, the father weeping for his son’s death and the son for his father’s?
