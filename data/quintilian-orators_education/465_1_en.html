Causes however also have both varieties of Peroration, both the one that enumerates Proofs and this tearful kind, if the litigant risks status or reputation. In trivial cases, of course, to raise such tragic storms is like putting Hercules’ mask and buskins on a baby.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_37_24" id="target_note_LCL126_37_24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>It is also worth pointing out that, in my opinion, it makes a crucial difference to an Epilogue how the client who is being put on display adapts himself to his advocate. Sometimes his ignorance, lack of sophistication, stiffness, and uncouthness make the whole thing a disaster, and the speaker must take care to guard against this. I have often seen clients resisting their advocate, showing no emotion in their faces, grinning at the wrong moments, and sometimes even raising a laugh by some action or expression of the face. It is particularly when things are done for dramatic effect that they turn out badly. On one occasion, an advocate arranged for a girl who was said to be the sister of the opponent (this was the point in dispute) to move over to the opposite benches. He intended to leave her in her brother’s arms; but I had warned the brother in advance, and he had left the court. The advocate, normally at no loss for words, was struck dumb by this unexpected turn of events, and moved his little girl back again, with disastrous effect. Another advocate, defending a woman, thought it a good idea to display a portrait of her husband; this repeatedly raised a laugh, because the persons entrusted with handing him the portrait, not knowing what was the Epilogue, let it be seen whenever he turned their way, and when it was finally put on display it proved so hideous (it was the old man’s wax death mask) that it ruined also the effect of the preceding speech. And there is a well-known story of what happened to Glycon, also called Spyridion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_39_25" id="target_note_LCL126_39_25"><sup>25</sup></a>
