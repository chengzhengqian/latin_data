<p>case hostile, or else unfavourably disposed to the case we have undertaken because of some personal interest, the technique of persuasion may be difficult, but the technique of speaking is quite straightforward: we shall simply pretend that we have confidence in his justice and in our Cause, and so have no fears. His vanity must be given a boost, by pointing out that his reputation for integrity and scrupulous decisions will be enhanced by his not indulging prejudice or personal interest. This applies also if we are referred back to judges from whose decision we have appealed: we should explain ourselves on grounds either of necessity (if the Cause admits this) or of some mistake or suspicion. The safest course therefore will be to admit regret, apologize for the fault, and try by every means to make the judge ashamed of his anger.</p>
<p>It sometimes happens also that a judge has to try a second time a case on which he has previously given judgement. The general procedure then is to say that we would not have disputed his judgement before another judge, because he himself is the only person who could properly correct it. In particular cases, however, as circumstances allow, it will occur to us to point out that some facts had been unknown, some witnesses missing, or the advocates incompetent (this last is to be said with great diffidence and only if there is absolutely no alternative). Again, if we have to plead before fresh judges (as in a second trial in a claim for freedom, or in cases involving two panels in the centumviral court),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_49_64" id="target_note_LCL494_49_64"><sup>64</sup></a> and if we lose at the first hearing, the proper thing is to spare the blushes of the original judges whenever that can be done. I have dealt with this at length in the context of Proofs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_49_65" id="target_note_LCL494_49_65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
