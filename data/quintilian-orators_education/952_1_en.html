<p>The side must be in tune with the Gesture, for the movement of the whole body is important, so much so that Cicero says that more is done by this than by the hands themselves. This is what he says in the <span class="italic">Orator</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_149_82" id="target_note_LCL494_149_82"><sup>82</sup></a> “No twiddling of the fingers, no marking the rhythm with the finger joint; he controls himself more by the pose of his whole body and the manly flexing of the side.” Slapping the thigh, which Cleon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_149_83" id="target_note_LCL494_149_83"><sup>83</sup></a> is supposed to have been the first to do at Athens, is common practice; it is quite proper for an indignant speaker, and it stimulates the audience. Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_149_84" id="target_note_LCL494_149_84"><sup>84</sup></a> notes the lack of it in Calidius: “no striking of the forehead or the thigh.” With regard to the forehead, I beg to differ; for even to clap your hands [beat your breast] is theatrical. Only rarely will it be proper to touch the breast with the tips of the fingers, hand hollowed, when for example we exhort, reproach, or commiserate with ourselves. In these circumstances, it will not be improper either to draw the toga back from the chest.</p>

<p>As to the feet, both stance and walk require attention.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_149_85" id="target_note_LCL494_149_85"><sup>85</sup></a> It is unsightly to stand with the right foot in front, and to put the same hand and foot forward together. It may be sometimes acceptable to put the weight on the right foot, but only if you hold your chest level; even so, this is a Gesture of comedy rather than of oratory.
