(Erasmus, <span class="italic">Encomium Moriae</span> 50)—is on laughter. This is associated with emotion by “Longinus” (38.5), who calls it πάθος ἐν ἡδονῇ, “emotion in pleasure,” meaning that when a pleasurable effect reaches a certain intensity it passes over into something we can no longer control. Quintilian’s view is somewhat different: concentrating as he does on the value of laughter to the pleader, he regards it as a solvent of emotion, which can be used to counter the feelings of pity or anger which the other side has aroused. He has many predecessors, both Greek and Latin. Aristotle’s work on comedy is lost, though opinions can be gleaned from <span class="italic">Ethics</span> and <span class="italic">Poetics</span> (see also R. Janko, <span class="italic">Aristotle on Comedy</span> (1984)); lost also, apart from a few fragments (710–711 Fortenbaugh), is Theophrastus’ περὶ γελοίου. Demetrius’ discussion of “charm” (χάρις) is important (§§ 128–172), though it goes well beyond the limits of practical rhetoric. However, it is not clear that Quintilian made any use of Greek sources. His main model is Cicero (<span class="italic">De oratore</span> 2.216–290: full commentary in Leeman–Pinkster–Rabbie, 1989; <span class="italic">Orator</span> 87–90), from whom he takes many details while (as it seems) modifying the order and classification (Kühnert, <span class="italic">Philologus</span> 106 (1962) 29–59; 305–314). It should be remembered that Cicero was celebrated for his wit, and that wit, particularly of a mordant kind, was much appreciated in the Roman courts.</p>
<p>6.3.1–21 is introductory, and begins (1–16) by making just these two points; Quintilian then (17–21) proceeds to an interesting discussion of terminology, discriminating between <span class="italic">venustus, salsus, facetus, dicax, urbanus,</span> and <span class="italic">iocus.</span></p>
<p>He then briefly states some distinctions. (1) Like oratory
