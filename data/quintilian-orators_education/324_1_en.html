What more pitiful effect could any Epilogue produce? It is too late to summon up emotion in your Peroration for matters which you narrated with perfect sang-froid; the judge has grown used to them, and remains unaffected by matters which did not stir him when they were fresh. It is hard to change a state of mind once established.</p>
<p>Personally (I will not conceal my opinion, though what I am going to say rests on examples rather than on any rules) I believe that Narrative, as much as any part of the speech, should be adorned with all possible grace and charm. But what matters most is the nature of the subject to be expounded. In minor cases, such as are most private suits, the ornamentation must be restrained and as it were tailored to the subject.
