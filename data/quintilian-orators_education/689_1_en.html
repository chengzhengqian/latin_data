<p>from the normal and simple form of expression; with others, on the other hand, the distinction is very tenuous, so that Irony is found both among Figures of Thought and among Tropes, while Periphrasis, Hyperbaton,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_13_5" id="target_note_LCL127_13_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and Onomatopoeia are treated by some distinguished authorities as Figures of Speech rather than as Tropes.</p>
<p>It is therefore all the more important to mark the difference between the two. A Trope, then, is language transferred from its natural and principal meaning to another for the sake of embellishment, or (as most <span class="italic">grammatici</span> define it), “an expression transferred from a context in which it is proper to one in which it is not.” A Figure, on the other hand, as its very name shows, is a configuration of language distinct from the common and immediately obvious form. In Tropes, therefore, words are substituted for words, as in Metaphor, Metonymy, Antonomasia, Metalepsis, Synecdoche, Catachresis, Allegory, and in most cases Hyperbole, for this last may involve both things and words. Onomatopoeia is the invention of a word; so this too is a substitute for other words which we would have used if we had not invented this one. Periphrasis again, even if it often includes the very word which it is designed to replace, still uses a number of words in place of just one. Epithet, because it generally involves an element of Antonomasia, is a Trope in virtue of this connection. In Hyperbaton, we have a change of order, and this is why many exclude it from the list of Tropes. However, it does “transfer” a word or a part of a word from its own place to a new one.</p>
<p>None of these features is found in Figures. A Figure can be formed out of words used in their proper sense and in a normal order. How one sort of Irony counts as a Trope and another sort as a Figure, I will show in due course.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_13_6" id="target_note_LCL127_13_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
