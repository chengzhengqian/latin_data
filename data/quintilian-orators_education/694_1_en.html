sorrow, pity, fear, trust, contempt, expressed in speaking, are therefore not Figures, any more than persuasion, menace, entreaty, and excuse are. Superficial observers, however, are misled, because they find Figures in all these contexts and they excerpt instances of them from speeches. In fact, of course, there is no area of oratory which does not have a place for Figures. But to give scope for a Figure is not the same as being a Figure. (I am not going to be afraid of repeating the same word over and over, to make the matter clear.) They will quote me some Figure spoken in anger, entreaty, or compassion; I understand that, but it does not follow that anger, compassion, and entreaty are Figures. Cicero, indeed, includes all ornaments of oratory under this head, choosing, I imagine, the middle course, neither judging all forms of expression to be Figures, nor yet only those which involved some device foreign to normal usage, but rather everything that was really striking and had particularly great power to move the audience. I give next an exact quotation of his treatment of this subject in two of his books, so as not to deprive my readers of the judgement of the highest authority of all.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_23_20" id="target_note_LCL127_23_20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In Book Three of <span class="italic">De oratore,</span> Cicero writes as follows: “In continuous speech, once we have secured the smoothness of construction and the rhythmical principles which I have described, our entire discourse must be studded and loaded with brilliant thoughts and words.
