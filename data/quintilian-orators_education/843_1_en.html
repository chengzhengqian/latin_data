It would have been much to be desired that they should be his equals, or at least approach his level. But they liked him only for his faults, and every one of them directed his efforts to reproducing what he could of these, and thus did Seneca’s reputation a disservice while claiming to speak in his style. In any case, Seneca had many great virtues: a ready and prolific talent, diligent study, and deep learning (though he was sometimes misled by those whom he employed to research into some subjects for him).
