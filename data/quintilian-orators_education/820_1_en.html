of our own times, when everything is designed to tickle the fancy of an uneducated general public. Even among those who want to pursue a correct stylistic line, some think that the only healthy and genuinely Attic manner consists of concise, plain language, as little removed as possible from everyday usage; others, on the other hand, are attracted by a loftier, more energetic and inspirational type of talent; and, thirdly, there are the many supporters of the smooth,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_275_41" id="target_note_LCL127_275_41"><sup>41</sup></a> polished, and sedate style. I shall speak in more detail about this difference when I come to Types of Oratory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_275_42" id="target_note_LCL127_275_42"><sup>42</sup></a> For the present I shall simply touch briefly on what qualities the student who wishes to consolidate his powers of speaking can expect to attain, and from what reading. My plan is to select a few authors, those who are the most eminent. It is easy for students to decide what authors most resemble these, and so no one will have cause to complain if I happen to pass over his favourites. I admit there are more who deserve to be read than will be mentioned here.</p>

Like his own Ocean,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_275_44a" id="target_note_LCL127_275_44a"><sup>44</sup></a> which he says is the source of 〈every〉 river and spring, Homer provides the model and the origin of every department
