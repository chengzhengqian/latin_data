What we call Issue (<span class="italic">status</span>), is called by some “Constitution,” by others “Question,” by others “that which the Question reveals.” Theodorus calls it “the head [that is, “the most general heading”] to which everything is referred.” These names are different, but the meaning is the same; it makes no difference to the learner what names anything is called by, so long as the thing itself is plain.</p>
