neither do the people who tell us that the origin of all things lies in fire or water or the four elements or indivisible bodies (atoms), or indeed those who calculate the distances between the stars or the size of the sun and the earth; yet they all call their study an art. And if reason enables them to appear not just to have an opinion of these things but to know them, because of the cogency of their proofs, reason may very well do as much for the orator. “But he doesn’t know whether his cause is true.” Neither does the doctor know whether the man who says he has a headache really has one, but he will treat him just the same, on the assumption that it is true, and his medicine will be an art. Again, rhetoric does not necessarily have the intention of always speaking the truth, but only the probable, but the orator does know that what he says is probable.</p>
<p>A further objection made by our opponents is that advocates often defend in one case what they have attacked in another. This is a fault of the person, not of the art.</p>
<p>These are the main points made against rhetoric; others are less important but derived from the same sources.</p>
<p>The proof that it is an art can be brief. If, as Cleanthes suggested, art is “a capability which acts by method,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_395_26" id="target_note_LCL124_395_26"><sup>26</sup></a> that is to say in an orderly way, then no one can doubt that there is method and order in speaking well. If we maintain the almost universally approved definition that an art “consists of cognitions agreeing and trained to cooperate towards an end useful to life,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_395_27a" id="target_note_LCL124_395_27a"><sup>27</sup></a> we have already shown that none of these elements is lacking in rhetoric. Surely, like other arts, it is based on theory and on practice. And it must be an art,
