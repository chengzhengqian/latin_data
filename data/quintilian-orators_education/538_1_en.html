the uneducated son failed to defend his innocent father. (It may be worthwhile pointing out at once that two General Questions—namely “everyone?” and “on behalf of <span class="italic">any</span> father?”—may arise out of a single Issue.)</p>
<p>These points have all come from considering <span class="italic">two</span> persons. From the third person, namely the opponent, no Question can arise, because there is no dispute about his having a share of the inheritance. But let us not relax yet. All the Arguments so far could have been used even if the father had not been recalled. Let us not go straight to the point that comes to mind immediately, namely that he was recalled as a result of what the uneducated son did. A little subtlety will see a little further. As Species comes after Genus, so Genus precedes Species. So let us imagine that the father was recalled by someone else. A “ratiocinative” or “syllogistic” Question will then arise: does recall from exile cancel the judgement, and effectively amount to the trial never having taken place? At this point the uneducated son will try to say that he could not have achieved the recall of both his relatives with a single reward, unless the recall of his father implied that he had not been accused, a fact which would itself cancel also the advocate’s penalty, for it would also imply that he had not defended his father. We come then to the thought which first struck us, namely that it was the uneducated son who restored his father. At this point we again reason syllogistically, whether the restorer should count as an advocate, because he produced the result which the advocate sought, and it is not unreasonable that an act which is more than the one demanded by the law should be treated as equivalent to it.</p>
