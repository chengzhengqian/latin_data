Division is: (a) Is any crime credible of <span class="italic">this</span> defendant? (b) Is <span class="italic">this</span> crime credible? However, as so often, expediency may reverse the order. It is not only reasons for intention which we have to look for, but sometimes also reasons for mistakes, such as drunkenness or ignorance; while these are mitigating factors in an Issue of Quality, they are damaging in a Conjecture. I suspect indeed that there can never be a person, at any rate in a real case, about whose character neither side says anything, whereas it is often irrelevant to ask about motives, for example in cases of adultery or theft, where the charges themselves imply the motive.</p>
<p>(3) We have next also to consider Design, which is a wide area: is it credible that the defendant hoped either that he could carry out this crime, or that it could be unknown when he had done it, or again that, even if it became known, he could be acquitted or meet with a light or tardy punishment, or one the trouble of which might seem less than the joy secured by the deed itself? Did he even think it worthwhile to bear the punishment? Then again, could he have done it more easily or safely at another time or in another way? So Cicero in <span class="italic">Pro Milone</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_209_32" id="target_note_LCL126_209_32"><sup>32</sup></a> lists the many occasions on which Milo could have killed Clodius with impunity. Again, why should he have chosen this particular place, time, and method for his attack? (This topic too is very thoroughly treated in the same defence.) Again, if he was not guided by any reasonable consideration, was he carried away by impulse without making a conscious decision (it is commonly said that crimes are without Design) or was he even led astray by a habit of wrongdoing?</p>
<p>Having dealt thoroughly with “whether he wished to do it,” which comes first, we come next to the question
