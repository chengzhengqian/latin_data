The same name covers the turgid, the trivial, the luscious, the redundant, the farfetched, and the extravagant. In short, it is the name given to whatever goes beyond the demands of good style, whenever the mind shows a lack of judgement and is deceived by a false appearance of good. It is the worst of all faults of eloquence, because the rest are due to failure to avoid them, whereas this is deliberately sought. And it is entirely a matter of Elocution.
