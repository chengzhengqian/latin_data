<p>I should like the toga itself to be round, and well cut to fit; otherwise there are many ways in which it will be unshapely. It is best if the front reaches to the middle of the shin, while the back is higher, to correspond with the girdle of the tunic. The fold (<span class="italic">sinus</span>) is most becoming if it falls a little above the bottom of the tunic; it should certainly never be below it. The fold which passes obliquely across the body like a belt, under the right shoulder and over the left, must be neither too tight nor too loose. The part of the toga which is arranged last should fall lower; it sits better like that, and is held in place better. A part of the tunic should also be drawn back, so that it does not fall down on to the upper arm in the course of the pleading; the fold should then be thrown over the shoulder, and it is not unbecoming to turn back the edge of it. However, the shoulder and the whole throat should not be covered, or the dress will be tight and lose the dignity which a broad chest can give. The left arm should be raised just so far as to form a right angle, and over it the double edge produced by the toga should fall evenly.</p>
<p>The hand<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_159_102" id="target_note_LCL494_159_102"><sup>102</sup></a> should not be loaded with rings, especially any which do not go over the middle joint. The best position for the hand is with the thumb raised and the fingers slightly flexed, unless holding a book. (This is in any case not something you should choose to do, because it suggests lack of confidence in your memory, and it is a hindrance to a great many Gestures.)</p>
<p>The ancients used to let the toga fall right down to the heels, like the Greek pallium;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_159_103" id="target_note_LCL494_159_103"><sup>103</sup></a> and this is recommended by Plotius and Nigidius, who wrote on Gesture at that
