Rhythm, it does not matter whether the dactylic foot has its short syllables before or after the long, because Rhythm only measures the time, to ensure that there is the same interval between the rise and the fall of the foot. (3) The measure of verse is quite different: an Anapaest or Spondee cannot replace a Dactyl, nor can a Paean begin or end indifferently with its short syllables or its long. (4) Further, the principle of Metre not only forbids the substitution of one foot for another, but does not even allow one Dactyl or Spondee, for example, to replace another. So if you alter the order of the five successive dactyls in <span class="italic">panditur interea domus omnipotentis Olympi,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_189_43" id="target_note_LCL127_189_43"><sup>43</sup></a> you will have destroyed the verse.</p>
<p>There are other differences also. (5) In Rhythms, the space available is unrestricted, in Metre it is limited; (6) Metre has fixed end cadences, Rhythm runs on as it began as far as its “shift” (<span class="italic">metabole</span>),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_189_44" id="target_note_LCL127_189_44"><sup>44</sup></a> that is to say the transition to another type of Rhythm; (7) Metre is a matter of words only, Rhythm includes movements of the body. (8) Rhythm also more readily allows unoccupied time units;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_189_45" id="target_note_LCL127_189_45"><sup>45</sup></a> these do occur also in Metre, but there is more freedom in Rhythm, where we measure time units both mentally and by the beat of foot or finger, mark the intervals by signs, and estimate the number of shorts that the space will hold. Hence we speak of “four-unit” and “five-unit” (tetrasemic, pentasemic)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_189_46" id="target_note_LCL127_189_46"><sup>46</sup></a> Rhythms, and indeed longer ones: <span class="italic">semeion</span> means a single time unit.</p>
