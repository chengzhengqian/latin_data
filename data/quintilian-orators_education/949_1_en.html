<span class="italic">crimen, Gai Caesar</span> has a sort of end of its own, because a conjunction follows; and then <span class="italic">et ante hanc diem non auditum</span> is clearly marked off. It is to <span class="italic">these</span> divisions that the hand movements should be adapted. This applies to the earlier and calmer part of a speech; when the temperature goes up, Gesture too will become more frequent as the Delivery becomes faster.</p>
<p>Some passages are better suited by a quick Delivery, some by a restrained one. We use the former to pass rapidly over things, to pile up details, and to hurry on; the latter to insist, to emphasize, and to drive points home. A slower Delivery is more emotive; hence Roscius, because he acted in comedy, was quicker, and Aesopus the tragic actor more sedate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_143_72" id="target_note_LCL494_143_72"><sup>72</sup></a> The same applies also to movements. In plays, young men, old men, soldiers, and married ladies advance sedately; slaves, slave girls, parasites, and fishermen move with more speed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_143_73" id="target_note_LCL494_143_73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>The experts also tell us never to raise our hand above eye-level, or lower it below the chest; so it is indeed wrong to have to pull your hand down from above your head, or to lower it to the bottom of your belly! It may be moved to the left as far as the shoulder; anything beyond that is unseemly. But when we thrust the hand out to the left to show aversion to something, the left shoulder should be brought forward, so as to coincide with a movement of the head towards the right.</p>
<p>The left hand never rightly makes a Gesture on its own,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_143_74" id="target_note_LCL494_143_74"><sup>74</sup></a> but it often lends support to the right, if we are either (1) telling off arguments on our fingers, or (2) turning</p>
