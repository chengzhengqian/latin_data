this he tends to be impatient with everything else and regard it as superfluous. If therefore we have to advance or refute a number of points, a Partition is both useful and agreeable, to ensure that the order in which we propose to speak of each matter is quite clear. If on the other hand there is a single charge to be defended in various ways, a Partition is superfluous. Consider the following example: “I shall say that the defendant who is my client is the kind of man of whom a charge of homicide is unbelievable; I shall say that he had no motive for the killing; I shall say that he was overseas when the man was killed.” Everything you set out in this Partition except the last point is bound to seem futile. The judge is in a hurry to get to the crux of the matter. The advocate, as it were, is bound by his promise; and if the judge is a patient man, he does not explicitly call upon him to fulfil it; but if he is busy, or a very powerful person, or simply cannot control his temper, he insists quite brutally. For this reason, some have criticized the Partition in Cicero’s <span class="italic">Pro Cluentio,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_303_2" id="target_note_LCL125_303_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in which he promised to show, first, that no man was ever brought to court on graver charges or on stronger evidence than Oppianicus; secondly, that the very judges by whom he was condemned had already passed previous judgements on the case; and finally that the attempt to bribe the jury had been made <span class="italic">against</span> Cluentius, not <span class="italic">by</span> him. Their point is that if the third statement could be proved, there was no need to make the first two. On the other hand, no one will be unfair or foolish enough to deny that the Partition in the <span class="italic">Pro Murena</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_303_3" id="target_note_LCL125_303_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is admirable: “I understand, members of the jury, that this whole accusation had three parts, one of which related to aspersions on my client’s way of life, one to his candidature for high office, and the third to charges of
