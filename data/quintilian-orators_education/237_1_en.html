<span class="label"><span class="italic">The oratory of praise and blame; Epideictic</span></span>
<p>I shall begin for preference with the Cause which consists of Praise and Blame. Aristotle and, following him, Theophrastus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_103_1" id="target_note_LCL125_103_1"><sup>1</sup></a> seem to have separated this class completely from the practical—that is the “pragmatic”—type, and made the audience the sole consideration in the whole affair; this indeed is in keeping with its name,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_103_2" id="target_note_LCL125_103_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which is derived from the notion of display. Roman custom, on the other hand, has found a place for this function in practical business. Funeral laudations are frequently attached to some public office and are often entrusted to magistrates by order of the Senate;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_103_3" id="target_note_LCL125_103_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to praise or discredit a witness is important in court; it is a permitted practice to let defendants have people to praise their character; and finally, the published speeches against Cicero’s fellow candidates, against Lucius Piso, and against Clodius and Curio, contain invective, and yet were spoken as formal voting statements in the Senate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_103_4" id="target_note_LCL125_103_4"><sup>4</sup></a> I do not deny that some themes of this kind are composed solely for display, for example panegyrics of the gods and great men of past ages. This solves a problem raised above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_103_5" id="target_note_LCL125_103_5"><sup>5</sup></a> and makes it clear that those who held that an orator would never speak except on matters which were in doubt were quite wrong. Must the praise of Jupiter Capitolinus, the invariable theme of the sacred contest, involve doubt, or else not be an oratorical subject at all?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_103_6a" id="target_note_LCL125_103_6a"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
