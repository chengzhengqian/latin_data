<p>(9) Cases of Unjust Repudiation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_259_39" id="target_note_LCL126_259_39"><sup>39</sup></a> are simpler; the peculiarity of cases under this law is that the defence is made by the accuser, and the accusation by the defendant.</p>
<p>(10) Explaining to the senate why one wishes to die.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_259_40" id="target_note_LCL126_259_40"><sup>40</sup></a> Here there is one Question of law, namely whether one should prevent a man whose motive for wanting to die is to escape legal action; all the other Questions are of Quality.</p>
<p>(11) There are also fictitious wills, devised so that the only question is of &lt;Quality,&gt; as in the <span class="italic">controversia</span> I expounded above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_259_41" id="target_note_LCL126_259_41"><sup>41</sup></a> in which a philosopher, a doctor, and an orator contend for the fourth part of the estate, which their father had left to “the most worthy” of his sons.</p>
<p>(12) The same situation arises in cases where female orphans claim marriages with relatives of equal propinquity, and there is a question among the relatives as to who is most suitable.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_259_42" id="target_note_LCL126_259_42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>However, I have no intention of going through every possible theme (fresh themes can still be invented) nor to deal with all the Questions in them, since these vary with the terms in which the problem is set. But I am surprised that Flavus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_259_43" id="target_note_LCL126_259_43"><sup>43</sup></a> whose authority weighs greatly with me, defined the range of Quality so narrowly, though he was writing a textbook specially for schools.</p>
