whether he <span class="italic">could</span> have done it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_211_33" id="target_note_LCL126_211_33"><sup>33</sup></a> Here we discuss Place and Time. For example, theft: was the place inaccessible or frequented? Was the time day (when there are more witnesses) or night (when there is more opportunity)? We therefore examine difficulties and chances, which are very numerous and so do not need illustration. This second topic means that, if the act could not have been committed, there is no case, but, if it could, the Question “Did he do it?” follows. These points involve also Conjecture as to Intention, for this is how one infers whether he had hopes. Means must also be considered: for example, the retinues of Clodius and of Milo.</p>
<p>The Question “Did he do it?” begins with the second division of time—that is, the present, &lt;either Adherent&gt; or Conjunct<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_211_34" id="target_note_LCL126_211_34"><sup>34</sup></a> (including sounds, shouts, groans)—and proceeding to the following stage (concealment, fear, and the like). To this must be added Signs (which I have already discussed),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_211_35" id="target_note_LCL126_211_35"><sup>35</sup></a> and also words and acts, both antecedent and subsequent to the crime. These are either our own or those of others. With words, our own do us more harm and less good than those of others, while those of others do us more good and less harm than our own. With actions, it is sometimes ours that profit us more, and sometimes those of others—for example, if our opponent has done something which tells in our favour—while there is always more damage from what we do than from what others do.</p>
<p>With words, there is yet another distinction, namely that they are either plain or of doubtful meaning. Doubtful words, whether our own or others’, are inevitably less telling
