As I have said, they are much the same as in the Prooemium,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_23_7" id="target_note_LCL126_23_7"><sup>7</sup></a> but freer and more extensive, because we court the judges’ favour in a more restrained manner at the outset, since at this stage it is enough to get a foot in the door, and the whole speech is still to come. On the Epilogue, on the other hand, depends the mood in which the judge retires to consider his verdict; we are not now going to say anything more, and there is no further stage to which we can put things off. It is therefore the common task of each side to win the judge’s good will, alienate him from the other party, and excite and assuage his emotions. The shortest rule that can be given for both parties is that the orator should visualize the full strength of his Cause, and, when he has seen what features of the facts give grounds, or seem to give grounds, for envy, good will, dislike, or pity, he should dwell on the things by which, were he in the judge’s place, he would himself be most moved. But it is safer to go into detail.</p>

However, some things, which it is sufficient to outline in that part, need filling out more in the Peroration: for instance, if the object of the prosecution is a man of violent, odious, or dangerous character, or if a conviction will be an honour to the judges or an acquittal a disgrace.

Fear too, if it has to be used (as Cicero uses it in the same context), has a more effective
