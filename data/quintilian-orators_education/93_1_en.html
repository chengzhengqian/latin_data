<p>by its four sides. If the calculation is too much for you, you can learn the same fact from smaller numbers. A 10-foot square has a perimeter of 40 feet and encloses an area of 100 feet. But if it is 15 feet by 5, the area enclosed is a quarter less, the perimeter being the same. And if we have a parallelogram measuring 19 feet by one, the number of square feet will be no more than the linear feet of one of the longer sides, though the perimeter will be the same as that of the 100-foot area. So the size of the enclosed area will diminish the more you depart from the square shape. Hence it is even possible that a larger perimeter may enclose a smaller area. This applies to level areas. In hills and valleys, even the inexpert can see that the ground area is greater than the sky that covers it.</p>
<p>But geometry also soars higher, to the very system of the universe. Here, when it teaches by its calculations the fixed and ordained courses of the stars, we learn that nothing is without order or fortuitous. This itself is sometimes relevant for the orator. When Pericles<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_235_43" id="target_note_LCL124_235_43"><sup>43</sup></a> freed the Athenians from the terror caused by the darkening of the sun by explaining the cause, or when Sulpicius Gallus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_235_44" id="target_note_LCL124_235_44"><sup>44</sup></a> spoke about the lunar eclipse to Lucius Paullus’ army, to prevent the soldiers from being terrified by what seemed a portent from heaven, does he not seem to have been performing an orator’s function? If Nicias in Sicily had known this,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_235_45" id="target_note_LCL124_235_45"><sup>45</sup></a> he would not have been confused by that same terror, and so ruined that splendid Athenian army. Dion, when he arrived to put down the tyranny of Dionysius, was not deterred by a similar occurrence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_235_46a" id="target_note_LCL124_235_46a"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
