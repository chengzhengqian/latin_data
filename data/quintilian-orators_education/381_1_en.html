<p>(4) We must also bear Means in mind, especially in Conjectural Causes. It is more credible that a smaller number of men should be killed by a larger, the weaker by the stronger, the sleeping by the waking, the unsuspecting by the well prepared. Converse arguments work in the opposite direction. We take this into account also in Deliberation, while in forensic oratory we usually relate it to two questions—did he wish to do it? could he have done it?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_391_47" id="target_note_LCL125_391_47"><sup>47</sup></a>—because hope also gives rise to wishes. Hence the famous Conjecture in Cicero: “Clodius lay in wait for Milo, not Milo for Clodius; Clodius had sturdy slaves with him, Milo had his womenfolk; Clodius was on horseback, Milo in a carriage; Clodius was stripped for action, Milo was entangled in his cloak.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_391_48" id="target_note_LCL125_391_48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>(5) With Means we may combine Instruments,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_391_49" id="target_note_LCL125_391_49"><sup>49</sup></a> since Resources also come under Means. Sometimes however Signs also arise from Instruments, as when the spear is found sticking in the corpse.</p>
