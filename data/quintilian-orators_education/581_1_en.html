The battle is therefore to be fought on Equity and the Spirit of the Law. It may be possible however to take examples from other laws to make it plain that we cannot always stand by the Letter, as Cicero did in <span class="italic">Pro Caecina.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_269_6" id="target_note_LCL126_269_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

In wills it also happens that the intention is clear, but there is nothing in writing, for example in the case of Curius, which gave rise to the well-known dispute between Lucius Crassus and Scaevola.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_269_8" id="target_note_LCL126_269_8"><sup>8</sup></a> An alternative heir had been appointed, in the event of a posthumous child dying while still under guardianship. No such son was born. The relatives claimed the property for themselves. Who could doubt that the testator’s intention was that the person who was to be heir if the son died should also be heir if no son was born? But he had not put this in writing.
