is: “Anyone who has knowingly done something as a result of which a man is certain to die.” Setting aside the Definition, it is sufficient for the accuser to say “You people were the cause of death, because it was through your action that he died, and if you had not done that he would still be alive.” The other side says: “It does not follow that a man through whose action someone has died should be condemned: what about prosecutors, witnesses, or judges in capital causes? Nor does the blame necessarily reside in the same quarter as the cause: suppose someone persuades a person to take a journey, or invites a friend from across the sea and the friend dies in a shipwreck; suppose someone invites a person to dinner and he dies of indigestion contracted there.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_235_33" id="target_note_LCL126_235_33"><sup>33</sup></a> Nor should the action of the young men be regarded as the only factor in the cause of death; there is the old man’s credulity, his weakness in bearing sorrow; in a word, if he had been braver or more sensible, he would still be alive. Nor did they act with any bad intention; and he could have guessed from the position of the mound or from its hasty construction that it was not a tomb. So why should they be condemned when they have none of the marks of the murderer—except the work of their hands?”</p>
<p>Sometimes we have an unquestioned Definition on which both parties agree, as in Cicero’s “Majesty resides in the dignity of the power and name of the Roman people.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_235_34" id="target_note_LCL126_235_34"><sup>34</sup></a> The Question is, however, whether this majesty has been diminished, as was the Question in the case of Cornelius. But although this case may seem to be one of Definition, nevertheless, since there is no doubt about the Definition, it is a judgement of Quality and should be referred rather to that Issue.</p>
