On the other hand, if I have to speak strictly and in accordance with rigorous standards of truth, I shall go on looking for the true orator whom Cicero also was looking for. I admit of course that Cicero himself had climbed the topmost peak of eloquence, and I can scarcely find anything which could be added to his qualities—though I might perhaps find something that I think he would have gone on to prune away, because scholars have generally judged that he possessed many virtues and some faults, and he himself bears witness to having restrained much of his youthful exuberance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_207_14" id="target_note_LCL494_207_14"><sup>14</sup></a> Nevertheless, since, though he was the last person to disparage himself, he never claimed to be “wise,” and since he could certainly have spoken better if he had been granted a longer life and a more secure period<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_207_15" id="target_note_LCL494_207_15"><sup>15</sup></a> in which to write, it is perhaps not ungenerous in me to believe that he failed to achieve that perfection which nobody came closer to achieving. If my feelings about him had been different, I could have argued for this position with more boldness and freedom. Marcus Antonius declared he had never seen a “competent speaker” (and this is a good deal less than an “orator”);<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_207_16" id="target_note_LCL494_207_16"><sup>16</sup></a> Cicero himself is still looking for his orator, and only imagining</p>
