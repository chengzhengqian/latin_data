“The laws are silent in the midst of arms”), and (2) it is perfectly proper to begin with a Reason and then complete the Argument, as in the same context:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_509_16" id="target_note_LCL125_509_16"><sup>16</sup></a> “But if the Twelve Tables allowed the killing of a thief without incurring a penalty either by night in any circumstances, or by day if he defended himself with a weapon, who can maintain that the killer is to be punished whatever the circumstances in which a man has been killed?” Cicero gave a further twist to this, and put the Reason back in the third place, by adding:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_509_17" id="target_note_LCL125_509_17"><sup>17</sup></a> “When he observes that the laws themselves sometimes put a sword into our hands . . .” On the other hand, he also went through all the parts in sequence: “What death can be unjust for the ambusher and the robber?” This is the Major Premiss. “What is the object of our escorts and our swords?” This is the Reason. “Surely, if we were not allowed to use them, we should not be allowed to have them.” This is the Conclusion (<span class="italic">conexio</span>) from the Reason and the Major Premiss.</p>
<p>This type of Proof may be met in three ways, that is to say with reference to any of its three parts; the Major Premiss, the Minor Premiss, and the Conclusion (<span class="italic">conclusio</span>) may all be attacked, and sometimes all three.</p>
