They therefore seem to me scarcely to be relevant to the rules of rhetoric; for where a sign is “irrefutable” there is no dispute either. This happens either when something occurs or has occurred <span class="italic">necessarily,</span> or when it simply cannot occur or have occurred. If this is stated as part of the Cause, there is no dispute of fact. This type of Sign comes into play in all three divisions of time: it is necessary that a woman who has given birth should have had intercourse with a man (past),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_361_2" id="target_note_LCL125_361_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that there should be waves when a high wind strikes the sea (contemporaneous), and that a man who has a wound in the heart should die (future). Again, there can be no harvest where no crop has been sown, a man cannot be at Rome when he is at Athens, or have been wounded by a sword when he has no scar. Some Signs work equally well in reverse also (a man who breathes is alive, a man who is alive breathes) but others are not reversible; it does not follow from “a man who comes in is moving” that “a man who moves is coming in.” Thus a woman who has not borne a child may have had intercourse with a man, and there may be waves without a high wind, and a man who dies has not necessarily had a wound in the heart. Similarly, a crop may have been sown where there has been no harvest, the man who was not at Athens may not have been at Rome, and the man who has a scar may not have been wounded by a sword.</p>
