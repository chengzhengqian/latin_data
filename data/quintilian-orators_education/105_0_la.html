We have ample comparative material in the Greek progymnasmata of Theon (Quintilian’s near contemporary), “Hermogenes” (with Priscian’s Latin adaptation, <span class="italic">RLM</span> 551–560), Libanius, Aphthonius, and Nicolaus. Lausberg §§ 1104–1139 summarizes the material; D. L. Clark, <span class="italic">Rhetoric in Greco-Roman Education</span> (1957) 176–212, gives a good brief account. The curriculum varied somewhat (Quintilian’s order is not exactly that of other rhetors) but progress from simple narrative through isolated argument to something like a whole speech (e.g. “a proposal for a law”) is universal. Familiarity with these exercises is to be assumed in all rhetorically trained writers of the Roman period; they are building-bricks in all sorts of work, poetry as well as prose.</p>

He regards this as somewhat controversial, because it takes time away from practice in declamation, which is what parents want. In discussing what beginners should read (2.5.18–24), Quintilian stresses Livy and Cicero, and the avoidance of the archaic or the decadent. A classical taste for lucidity and amplitude is to be formed. Fuller advice comes much later, in 10.1. Theon 13 (pp. 102–105 Patillon–Bolognesi: a chapter known only from the Armenian version) also advises on reading.</p>
