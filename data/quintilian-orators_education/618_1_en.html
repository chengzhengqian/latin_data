he have made the Roman people show their admiration not only by acclamation but by clapping their hands? No, it was the sublimity and the splendour, the elegance and the authoritative manner that evoked that storm of applause.

And this is so true that, since vices and virtues in this area are particularly close neighbours, those who adopt the vices actually give them the names of the virtues.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_343_5" id="target_note_LCL126_343_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Therefore I do not want any of our
