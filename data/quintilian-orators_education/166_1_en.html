Cicero’s <span class="italic">De oratore,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_381_4" id="target_note_LCL124_381_4"><sup>4</sup></a> calls it a kind of observation, not an art. This statement however is not put there for us to accept it as true, but to fit Antonius’ character, because he was a man who concealed his art. Lysias,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_381_5" id="target_note_LCL124_381_5"><sup>5</sup></a> however, seems to have been of the same opinion. The defence of it is that uneducated people, barbarians, and slaves, when they are speaking to defend themselves, produce something like a Prooemium, and then narrate, prove, refute, and finally beg for mercy in the equivalent of an Epilogue. Advocates of this view add some well-known sophistries: nothing based on art can have existed before the art; but men did speak to defend themselves or attack others, and the first teachers of the art came later, in the time of Tisias and Corax;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_381_6" id="target_note_LCL124_381_6"><sup>6</sup></a> therefore oratory existed before the art, and cannot be an art. For my part, I am not concerned about when the teaching first began. However, in Homer we find Phoenix as a teacher of “doing and speaking,” a number of other orators, examples of each type of style in the three leaders, and competition in eloquence among the young. Furthermore, law-suits and pleaders are to be seen in the engravings on Achilles’ shield.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_381_7" id="target_note_LCL124_381_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>It is sufficient to remind ourselves that everything which art makes perfect had its origin in nature. Otherwise, let us do away with medicine, which was discovered
