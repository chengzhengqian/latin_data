Often indeed we both say that expediency must be spurned, so that we can act honourably (as for instance when we advise the men of Opitergium not to surrender, though they will die unless they do so); and also give priority to expediency over honour, as when we counsel arming the slaves in the Punic War.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_131_27" id="target_note_LCL125_131_27"><sup>27</sup></a> But in this case, we must not admit outright that this is dishonourable (for we can argue that all men are free by nature and composed of the same elements, and these were perhaps born of ancient and noble stock),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_131_28" id="target_note_LCL125_131_28"><sup>28</sup></a> and, in the previous case, where the danger is manifest, we can put forward other arguments, alleging that they would die a yet more cruel death if they surrendered, should the enemy break faith or (which is more likely) Caesar prove victorious.
