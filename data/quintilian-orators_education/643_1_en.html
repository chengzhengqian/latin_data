<p>man who struck someone “touched” him or one who wounded a man “hurt” him. There is an example of both in <span class="italic">Pro Caelio</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_393_1" id="target_note_LCL126_393_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Suppose there was a widow woman living as she liked, a forward woman behaving with effrontery, a wealthy woman living extravagantly, a wanton woman living like a whore—should I take a man to be an adulterer if he addressed this lady rather freely?” Here he called an immodest woman a whore, and said that a man who had long been her lover “addressed her rather freely.” This type is reinforced and becomes clearer if the stronger words are contrasted with the terms for which we are to substitute them. Thus Cicero in the <span class="italic">Verrines</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_393_2" id="target_note_LCL126_393_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “We have brought before your court not a thief, but a plunderer; not an adulterer, but a stormer of women’s virtue; not a committer of sacrilege, but the avowed enemy of all sacred things and religious observances; not an assassin, but a bloodthirsty butcher of our fellow-citizens and our allies.” The first method makes the matter seem great, the second makes it seem more than great.</p>
<p>There are, in my view, four main kinds of Amplification, based on Increment, Comparison, Inference, and Accumulation.</p>
<p>(1) Increment is most powerful when even comparatively insignificant things are made to seem important. This is done either by one step or by several; the process not only goes to the top, it sometimes in a sense goes beyond it. A single example from Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_393_3" id="target_note_LCL126_393_3"><sup>3</sup></a> suffices to show all these features: “It is wrong to bind a Roman citizen, a crime to flog him, little short of parricide to put him to death: what shall I say about putting him on the cross?” If he had merely been flogged, there would have been one stage of Increment (taking the previous stage to be itself</p>
