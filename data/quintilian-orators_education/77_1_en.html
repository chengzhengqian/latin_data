hendecasyllables, which are portions of sotadeans<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_203_3" id="target_note_LCL124_203_3"><sup>3</sup></a> (no advice is needed about sotadeans themselves!), should be banned if possible, or, if not, at least reserved for more mature years. As to comedy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_203_4" id="target_note_LCL124_203_4"><sup>4</sup></a> whose contribution to eloquence can be very great, since it involves every kind of character and emotion, I shall point out soon, in its proper place, what use I think it is to boys.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_203_5" id="target_note_LCL124_203_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Of course, once the moral character is secure, it will be among the principal things to be read—Menander, I mean—though I should not rule out others either, for even the Latin authors will be of some service. But with boys, the texts to be read should be those which will best nourish the mind and develop the character. Life will give time enough for the rest, which are important only for academic scholarship. The old Latin poets also, though most of them were stronger in natural talent than in art,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_203_6" id="target_note_LCL124_203_6"><sup>6</sup></a> can make an important contribution, especially in richness of vocabulary; in their tragedies one can find dignity, in their comedies elegance and a kind of Attic quality. They are also more careful about organization than most of the moderns, who have come to think that clever phrases <span class="italic">(sententiae)</span> are the only virtue in any work. Certainly a high moral tone, and, if I may say so, manliness, has to be sought from them, now that we have degenerated into all the vices of voluptuousness even in our style of speaking. Finally, let us trust the great orators, who use the works of the early poets either to support their cases or to adorn their eloquence. Particularly in Cicero,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_203_7" id="target_note_LCL124_203_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
