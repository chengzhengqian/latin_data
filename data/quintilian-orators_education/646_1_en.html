example I used there,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_399_9" id="target_note_LCL126_399_9"><sup>9</sup></a> but for a different purpose. What I have to show here is that not only can wholes be compared with wholes for the sake of exaggeration, but parts with parts. So in this passage: “That great man, Publius Scipio, the pontifex maximus, acting as a private citizen, killed Tiberius Gracchus, whose subversion of the existing political order was not so very radical: shall we, as consuls, tolerate Catiline, whose ambition is to devastate the world with fire and sword?” Here Catiline is contrasted with Gracchus, the constitution of the state with the world, a not very radical subversion with fire and sword and devastation, and a private citizen with the consuls. If anyone chose to expand these points, each one of them is capable of ample development.</p>
<p>(3) As for Amplifications by Inference, which I mentioned, I wonder if this was quite the right word for it—not that I am unduly worried about this, so long as the thing itself is clear to the student. My point was, anyway, that this Amplification is made in a certain place, but has its effect in another. One thing is magnified to augment another, and a transition is made by an inference to the thing which we wish to emphasize. Cicero is going to reproach Antony with his drunkenness and vomiting: “You,” he says, “with your throat, your lungs, your gladiator’s physique.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_399_10" id="target_note_LCL126_399_10"><sup>10</sup></a> What have throat and lungs to do with drunkenness? They are by no means pointless; by thinking about them we can estimate how much wine he downed at Hippias’ wedding, so that he was unable to carry or digest it, despite his “gladiator’s physique.” So, if one fact is inferred from another, Inference is not an improper or an unusual word to use;
