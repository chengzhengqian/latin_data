fashioning an orator, give eloquence not arms to fight with, but a tambourine?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_467_9" id="target_note_LCL125_467_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>So let the young man whom we are educating prepare himself, as far as he can, to imitate real life. He will often have to do battle in the forum; let him therefore, while he is in school, set his sights on winning, and learn how to aim for his opponent’s vital places and protect his own. This is what his teacher must demand, and what he must particularly praise when he finds it. Just as young people may be led into bad ways by praise, so praise may hold them to good ones. The trouble nowadays is that teachers often pass over the essentials in silence, and effectiveness is not counted one of the virtues of eloquence. But I have treated these matters also in another work,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_467_10" id="target_note_LCL125_467_10"><sup>10</sup></a> and I shall often need to recur to them in this. For the present, I return to my plan.</p>
<h3><span class="ac">Chapter 13</span></h3>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Refutation</span></span>
<p>Refutation may be understood in two senses, because (1) the function of the defence consists entirely in Refutation, and (2) each side has to rebut what is said by the other. It is in this second sense that Refutation is assigned to the fourth place in the Cause.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_467_1" id="target_note_LCL125_467_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the methods are similar in either case. The principle governing Arguments in this part cannot be sought in any Places which are not used for the Confirmation; Topics, Thoughts, Words, and Figures also follow the same guidelines. As to Emotions, only the gentler ones are normally relevant here.</p>
