or madness. Pamphilus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_67_32" id="target_note_LCL125_67_32"><sup>32</sup></a> was of the same opinion, but he divided Quality into several parts.</p>
<p>Many later writers, simply changing the names, spoke of “things that are not agreed” and “things that are agreed.” For it is true (and it cannot be otherwise) that a fact must be either agreed or not. If it is not agreed, we have Conjecture. If it is agreed, we have the other types of Issue. Apollodorus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_67_33" id="target_note_LCL125_67_33"><sup>33</sup></a> means the same when he thinks that a Question must lie either in things outside us (which give scope to Conjecture) or in our opinions; he calls the first category <span class="italic">pragmatic,</span> the second <span class="italic">peri ennoias</span> (“concerning the idea”). Those who use the terms <span class="italic">aprol</span>ē<span class="italic">pton</span> and <span class="italic">prol</span>ē<span class="italic">ptikon</span>—that is to say, “doubtful” and “presumed” (in other words, “quite clear”)—are saying the same thing, as indeed is Theodorus, who thinks that the questions asked concern (a) whether a thing exists, (b) the accidents of something whose existence is agreed (that is to say, <span class="italic">peri ousias kai symbeb</span>ē<span class="italic">kot</span>ō<span class="italic">n</span>). In all these classifications, the first class contains Conjecture, and the second all the rest. These others Apollodorus wishes to make two in number, namely Quality and “concerning the name,” that is to say Definition; Theodorus gives “what,” “of what sort,” “how great,” and “relation.” Some would place “same and other” sometimes under Quality and sometimes under Definition.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_67_34" id="target_note_LCL125_67_34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Posidonius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_67_35a" id="target_note_LCL125_67_35a"><sup>35</sup></a> also has a twofold classification: verbal expression and things. Under “verbal expression” he sets the questions whether the word means anything, what it means, how many things it means, and in what way: under

As a Stoic, Posidonius treated rhetoric as a branch of logic, and his use of the ϕωνή/πράγματα (verbal expression/things) distinction to classify the Issues reflects this. His theory may be a response to Hermagoras. See Kidd ad loc.
