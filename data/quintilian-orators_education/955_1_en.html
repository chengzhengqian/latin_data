these things impair the force of the speech, cool the emotion, and make the judge feel that he is not being treated with sufficient respect. To cross over to the opposite benches is bad manners: Cassius Severus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_155_95" id="target_note_LCL494_155_95"><sup>95</sup></a> wittily asked for ropes to be put in place<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_155_96" id="target_note_LCL494_155_96"><sup>96</sup></a> to protect him against an opponent who did this; and anyway, though the outward move may sometimes look energetic, the return journey is invariably a disaster.</p>
<p>Much of this advice will need to be modified by those who appear before tribunals.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_155_97" id="target_note_LCL494_155_97"><sup>97</sup></a> Here, the face must be held more erect, so as to look towards the presiding judge, and Gestures must be higher up, again for his benefit. There are other differences which will occur to everyone without my mentioning them. Again, my general advice does not wholly apply to pleaders who speak from their seats;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_155_98" id="target_note_LCL494_155_98"><sup>98</sup></a> this is common in minor cases, it allows no scope for vehemence in Delivery, and some faults are unavoidable. If you are sitting on the left of the judge, you <span class="italic">must</span> put your right foot forward,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_155_99" id="target_note_LCL494_155_99"><sup>99</sup></a> while if you are on his other side many Gestures must be made towards the left, so that they are directed to the judge. I note that many people rise to their feet at the close of every sentence, and that some even take frequent little walks; it is for them to decide whether this is appropriate. When they do this, anyway, they are no longer speaking from their seat.</p>
<p>As for taking drink or food in the course of a speech—which many used to do, and some still do—may this be far from my orator’s thoughts! If a man cannot sustain the burden of speaking without this, it is not such an unhappy fate</p>
