<p>(1) Sometimes it is right to ask the single Question, whether the word is applicable: for example, is what is done in the brothel adultery? If we deny this, we do not have to explain what it should be called, because we are denying the whole charge. (2) Sometimes the Question is which of two terms is applicable: is it theft or sacrilege? (Not that it is not sufficient to show that it is not sacrilege, but it would be an advantage to show what else it is.) In this context, both terms must be defined. (3) Sometimes the Question is about things which differ in species, and we ask whether two things are both to be called by the same name, when both have names of their own, like “love-potion” and “poison.” In all disputes under this head the Question is “Is <span class="italic">this</span> thing <span class="italic">also</span> properly so called?” because the disputed name certainly applies to some other thing.

<p>Another difference in Definitions arises because those which mean the same may not be expressed in the same words: thus Rhetoric is “the science of speaking well” and also the science of “inventing well” and “expressing well” and “speaking in accordance with the virtue of oratory” and “speaking as duty demands.” One must take care here that if there is no conflict of sense there is a difference in
