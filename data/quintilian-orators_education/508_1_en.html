from the same class as the laughter-producing, but which do not actually produce laughter. For example: it was said of Asinius Pollio, who had equal talents for the serious and the humorous, that he was “a man for all hours,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_123_119" id="target_note_LCL126_123_119"><sup>119</sup></a> and of a pleader who was a fluent extempore speaker that he kept his talents “in ready cash.” There is also a remark of Pompey, reported by Marsus, concerning Cicero, when the latter was losing faith in the party: “Go over to Caesar, you will have me to be afraid of.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_123_120" id="target_note_LCL126_123_120"><sup>120</sup></a> If this had been said on a less serious subject, or in another spirit, or indeed not by Pompey, it might have counted as a joke. Compare also what Cicero wrote to Caerellia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_123_121" id="target_note_LCL126_123_121"><sup>121</sup></a> explaining why he bore life under Caesar so patiently: “It has to be endured either with the courage of a Cato or with the stomach of a Cicero”—the word “stomach” has something funny about it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_123_122" id="target_note_LCL126_123_122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p>I felt I could not suppress thoughts which so stimulated me; I may have been wrong in them, but I have not misled my readers, since I have also given the contrary view, which they are at liberty to follow if they prefer it.</p>
