little questions. Character reveals itself too more naturally in games—but bear in mind that no age is too immature to learn straight away what is right and what is wrong, and that the best age for forming character is when they do not know how to pretend, but obey their teachers most readily. It is easier to break than to straighten anything which has hardened into a bad shape. There must be no delay, then, in warning the boy that he must not behave greedily, dishonestly, or without controlling himself. Let us always keep in mind the words of Vergil:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">So strong is habit in the tender plant.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_101_2" id="target_note_LCL124_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Flogging a pupil is something I do not at all like, though it is an accepted practice and Chrysippus approves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_101_3" id="target_note_LCL124_101_3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the first place, it is humiliating and proper only for slaves; and certainly it is an infringement of rights (as it is agreed to be at a later age).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_101_4" id="target_note_LCL124_101_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Secondly, if a boy is so lacking in self-respect that reproof is powerless to put him right, he will even become hardened to blows, like the worst type of slave. And finally, there will be no need for this form of punishment if there is always someone there to make sure the work gets done. As it is, we try to make amends for the negligence of the <span class="italic">paedagogi</span> not by forcing boys to do the right thing but by punishing them for not having done it. Moreover, though you may compel a child with blows, what can you do with a young man who cannot be threatened like this and who has more important lessons to learn? And again, when children are beaten, the pain and fear often have results which it is not pleasant to speak of</p>
