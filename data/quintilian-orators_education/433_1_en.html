an Objection can be put forward. This is either (1) if something included by our adversary in the depositions has been discussed in consultation between advocates<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_495_43" id="target_note_LCL125_495_43"><sup>43</sup></a> (in this case we shall be answering something they have said, not something we have invented), or (2) if the Cause is of such a kind that we can put forward definite points such that nothing more can be said.

If we do not do this, we shall never use Objections, for there will be no one for us to answer.</p>

Again: a man who knows what are the strongest points in his own and his opponentâ€™s Cause will
