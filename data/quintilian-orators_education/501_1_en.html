greatest sources of laughter. The two are closely related, indeed almost identical; but Simulation amounts to faking an opinion of one’s own, Dissimulation to pretending not to understand what others mean. (1) Simulation is illustrated by Afer’s remark, when his opponents kept saying that Celsina (an influential lady) had decided the case: “Who is <span class="italic">he?</span>” he asked. (He pretended to think Celsina was a man.)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_109_92" id="target_note_LCL126_109_92"><sup>92</sup></a> (2) Dissimulation is the point in Cicero’s response, when a witness called Sextus Annalis had damaged his client, and the prosecutor kept pressing him, and saying “Marcus Tullius, can you say anything of Sextus Annalis?” He began to quote lines from Ennius, Annals Six:</p>
