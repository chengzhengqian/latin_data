of events. For example: “A father who has now recognized a son whom he exposed in infancy shall pay for his keep before taking him back.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_161_10" id="target_note_LCL126_161_10"><sup>10</sup></a> A disobedient son may be disinherited. A father who took back a son who had been exposed orders him to marry a rich neighbour. The son wishes to marry the daughter of the poor man who brought him up.” The law about exposed children is relevant to the emotional side of the case; the decision hangs on the law of disinheritance. But a Question may depend on more than one law, as in cases of Conflict of Laws. Once these points have been determined, the area of contention will become obvious.</p>
<p>(2) An example of a complex defence is <span class="italic">Pro Rabirio</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_161_11" id="target_note_LCL126_161_11"><sup>11</sup></a> “If he had killed him, he would have done right; but he did not kill him.” But when we make a number of points against a single proposition, we have first to think of everything that can possibly be said, and secondly to judge where best to say each of these things. My view on this is different from what I conceded above about Propositions,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_161_12" id="target_note_LCL126_161_12"><sup>12</sup></a> and about Arguments when I was discussing Proofs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_161_13" id="target_note_LCL126_161_13"><sup>13</sup></a> namely that we might sometimes begin with the stronger points. For here the Questions must <span class="italic">always</span> be in ascending order of strength, and proceed from the weakest to the most powerful, whether they are of the same character or different. Questions of law sometimes consist of a series of different points of conflict, whereas Questions of fact always have the same point in view; the <span class="italic">order</span> is similar in both.</p>
<p>Let us begin with points of different character. The weakest of these must be stated first of all, because it is common practice to discuss some Questions and then concede or make a gift of them to the other side, and we cannot
