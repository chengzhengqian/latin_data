(56) among hexameter writers, on the authority of Horace, is at least curious (see also 12.11.27). It is clear anyway (see 56, 58, 61, 63) that his choice of Greek poets to mention is largely governed by the use and mention of them in the Latin poets.</p>
<p>The Latin canon is more original, though Cicero and Horace are both sources of opinions. Vergil and other epic writers come first (85–92), the discussion culminating in an encomium of the poetry of Domitian. Elegy follows (93); next satire (93–96), lyric (96), tragedy and comedy (97–100), history (101–104), oratory (105–122), with a natural concentration on Cicero; and finally philosophy (123–131), culminating in Quintilian’s famous attack on the influence of Seneca, whom he regards as a great writer but a dangerous model. Quintilian is in many ways hopeful of the future of Latin literature, despite his severe criticism of oratorical and declamatory affectation. (See the useful remarks by R. G. Mayer in <span class="italic">Love and Latin Literature: Essays Presented to E. J. Kenney</span> (Cambridge, 1999) 146–148.)</p>
<p>It is important to remember that this is not a history of literature, though it contains a good deal of information, and a large number of neat, sometimes glib, critical comments. These all relate to the value of the author under discussion for stylistic imitation. This is also the purpose of Dionysius’ work; and there are comparable lists in Theon, <span class="italic">Progymnasmata</span> 13 (101–104 Patillon–Bolognesi), Dio Chrysostom, <span class="italic">Oration</span> 18, and Hermogenes 395–413 Rabe (trans. Wooten (1987) 119–130). Rutherford (1998) 39–53 discusses these lists.</p>
<p>10.2 is more theoretical. Imitation is an important principle in many activities (1–3), but not sufficient in itself,
