by saying <span class="italic">either</span> “all crimes involve bad men and this is why they are so often detected” <span class="italic">or</span> “it is wrong for crimes to be defended on the ground of their outrageousness”), and sometimes (b) on special grounds, which are various. Thus good standing both protects a defendant and is sometimes turned into an argument for his guilt, on the ground that it has given him hope of impunity. Likewise poverty, humble position, and wealth are open to very different interpretations, according to the individual’s natural qualities. However, a good character and an honourable past life never fail to be a great help. If no character charge is made, the defending advocate will lean heavily on this aspect, while the prosecutor will try to tie down the hearing to the question in hand, the only one (he will say) which is before the court, and will remark that “everyone has to start going wrong at some time” and the fact that it is a first offence is not to be taken as an excuse. These points are the ones to make in a reply; but the prosecutor should also, in his original pleading, dispose the judge to believe that he has been unwilling rather than unable to bring charges against character. It is thus better to refrain from any attack on the defendant’s past life than to weigh into him with slight, frivolous, or manifestly false charges, because these detract from the credibility of everything else. A speaker who makes no such allegations can be believed to have left them out as superfluous to his case, whereas one who assembles insubstantial ones is admitting that his only Argument rests on the defendant’s past life, and he would rather be refuted in this than say nothing. The other points which are commonly derived from character have been explained in connection with Topics of Arguments.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_205_29" id="target_note_LCL126_205_29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
