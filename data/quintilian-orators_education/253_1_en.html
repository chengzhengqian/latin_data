Cato or Marius is to be persuaded to run for office, and whether the elder Scipio or Fabius is discussing strategy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_135_32" id="target_note_LCL125_135_32"><sup>32</sup></a> Sex, rank, and age must also be considered, though it is character that will make the biggest difference. It is very easy to commend an honourable course to honourable men; but if we try to ensure the right action from persons of bad character, we must take care not to seem to be criticizing their very different way of life, but must try to affect the hearer’s attitude by appealing not to honour in itself, for which he has no regard, but to praise, public opinion, and (if these vanities are ineffectual) the future advantages, or, even more, by pointing out some frightening consequences of taking the opposite course. For, apart from the fact that the minds of the unprincipled are very easily frightened, it is perhaps natural that the fear of evil should weigh more with most people than the hope of good, just as they find it easier to understand the shameful than the honourable. Sometimes improper advice is given to good men too, and bad men are counselled in ways that concentrate on the interests of those who seek advice.</p>

The object of an adviser is the advantage of the person whom he advises. ‘But these things are right.’ Of course they are; but there is not always scope for the right in giving advice.” But this is a deeper question and not relevant only to advisory speeches; so I shall keep it for Book Twelve, which is to be the last.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_135_34" id="target_note_LCL125_135_34"><sup>34</sup></a> Not that I should like anything disgraceful to be
