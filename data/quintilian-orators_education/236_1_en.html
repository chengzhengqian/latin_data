one will say that a disowned son also counts as a child, and will draw an argument from the law which opposes his own claim; it was unnecessary (he will say) for a disowned son to be debarred from his fatherâ€™s property if he was reckoned as one outside the family; but now, as he would have been the heir of his intestate father in virtue of his rights as a son, the law is quoted against him, though it does not stop him from being a son, but only from being the heir. The Issue is Definition: What is a son? (2) The bastard in turn infers that his father did not die childless, with the same arguments that he used in his claim to prove that he was a son, unless he too turns to Definition: are non-legitimate children children?</p>
<p>Thus, in this one <span class="italic">controversia,</span> we shall have <span class="italic">either</span> two special Legal Issues (Letter and Spirit, and Inference) together with Definition <span class="italic">or</span> the only three which have a basis in nature, namely Conjecture (in Letter and Spirit), Quality (in Inference), and (obviously) Definition.</p>
<p>In every type of Cause there is a Motive, a Point to Decide, and a Core. Nothing can be said in which there is not some reason, something to which judgement is directed, and something which contains the essence of the matter. But as these vary more in actual court cases and are usually taught by writers on Judicial Causes, they may be postponed to that part of my work. For the moment, having divided Causes into their three classes, I shall take these in order.</p>
