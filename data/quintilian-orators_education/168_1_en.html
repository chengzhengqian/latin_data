learning. On the other hand, one can say that he would have been more outstanding if he had learned; for he never ventured to write down his speeches, though we know he delivered them with great effect.</p>
<p>Aristotle, in his usual way, devised some arguments of characteristic subtlety in his <span class="italic">Gryllus,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_385_11" id="target_note_LCL124_385_11"><sup>11</sup></a> for the sake of discussion; but he also wrote three books on the art of rhetoric and, in the first, not only admits it to be an art but says it is a part both of “politics” and of “dialectic.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_385_12" id="target_note_LCL124_385_12"><sup>12</sup></a> Critolaus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_385_13" id="target_note_LCL124_385_13"><sup>13</sup></a> and Athenodorus of Rhodes have argued at length on the other side. Agnon diminished his own credibility by the title of his book, which he openly declared an “Accusation of Rhetoric.” As to Epicurus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_385_14a" id="target_note_LCL124_385_14a"><sup>14</sup></a> I feel no surprise; he rejected all forms of education.</p>

<p>(1) Their first argument is based on the subject matter. All arts, they say, have a subject matter. This is true. Rhetoric, they say, has none of its own. In what follows I shall show this to be false.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_385_15" id="target_note_LCL124_385_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>(2) Their second slander is that no art assents to false propositions, because it cannot exist without a cognitive presentation which is invariably true,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_385_16" id="target_note_LCL124_385_16"><sup>16</sup></a> whereas rhetoric does assent to falsehoods, and therefore is not an art.
