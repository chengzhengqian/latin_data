reduce (1) length and (2) tedium.</p>
<p>(1) We shall manage to reduce the length by postponing what we can, while never forgetting to mention what it is that we are going to postpone: “What motives he had for killing him, what accomplices he picked, how he set his ambush, I will explain when I come to my proofs.” Some points however should be simply omitted from the account, as in Cicero:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_245_39" id="target_note_LCL125_245_39"><sup>39</sup></a> “Fulcinius dies; there are many matters involved in this event which I shall pass over, because they have nothing to do with the Cause.”</p>
<p>(2) Partition also relieves tedium: “I shall tell you what happened before the beginning of this affair, I shall tell you what happened during it, and I shall tell what happened afterwards.” This will give the impression of three modest Narratives instead of one long one. Sometimes it will be advantageous to interrupt the Narrative with a brief interjection like “You have heard what happened before; now learn what follows.” The judge will then feel refreshed by reaching the end of the first stage, and will prepare himself as it were for a fresh beginning.</p>
<p>If, however, when all these devices have been applied, the sequence of facts still turns out to be long, it will be useful to add a résumé at the end: Cicero does this even in a brief Narrative:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_245_40" id="target_note_LCL125_245_40"><sup>40</sup></a> “Hitherto, Caesar, Quintus Ligarius has been wholly free of blame; he left home not only with no war in view, but without the slightest suspicion of war,” and so on.</p>

<p>The Narrative will be credible (1) if we consult our own hearts first and so do not say anything contrary to what is
