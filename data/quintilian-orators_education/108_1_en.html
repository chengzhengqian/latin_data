a lower school, and practises rhetoric under the <span class="italic">grammatici.</span> So (ridiculous as it is) a boy is not thought fit to go to the declamation master until he knows how to declaim.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Grammaticus and rhetor: the place of progymnasmata in the curriculum</span></span>
<p>We must however give the two professions their proper spheres. <span class="italic">Grammaticē</span> (it has been translated <span class="italic">litteratura</span> in Latin) must learn to know its own limits, especially as it has advanced so far beyond the modest bounds which its name implies, within which its earlier professors confined themselves. At its source a tiny trickle, it has gathered strength [from historians and critics] and now flows in full flood, having come to comprise not only the principles of correct speech (in itself no inconsiderable matter) but the knowledge of almost all the major arts. Rhetoric for its part, named as it is from the power of speaking,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_265_2" id="target_note_LCL124_265_2"><sup>2</sup></a> must not shirk its proper duties or rejoice to see burdens which belong to it taken up by others; indeed, by surrendering some of the work, it has almost been driven out of its rightful possessions. I shall not deny, of course, that some individual among those who profess <span class="italic">grammaticē</span> may progress to a stage of knowledge which makes him fully capable of teaching these things too; but when he does so, he will be performing the rhetor’s function, not his own.</p>
<p>We next ask when a boy may be thought mature enough to grasp the precepts of rhetoric. For this purpose, we must think not of the actual age of the person, but of what progress he has already made in his studies. To save longer discussion of the question “When should he be sent on to the rhetor?” the best answer, I think, is “When he is fit.”</p>
