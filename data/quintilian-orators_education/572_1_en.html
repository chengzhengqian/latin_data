And indeed this is often correct, and there have been teachers who called these “themes of obligations.” But these laws sometimes admit of other Issues also. (1) Conjecture occurs from time to time in many of them (when defendants contend either that they did not do it, or that they did it with good intentions; there are many examples of this). (2) Mental incapacity and wrongful treatment require Definition of these terms.

Q. appears to be thinking specifically of declamation, in which the theme contains a statement of the law as its first item, though the Issue may not depend on the interpretation of it.
