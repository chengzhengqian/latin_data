A speech which is out of keeping with the speaker is just as bad as one which is out of keeping with the subject to which it ought to have been adapted. This is why Lysias is thought to have been so successful in faithfully maintaining realism in the speeches he wrote for uneducated clients.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_141_42" id="target_note_LCL125_141_42"><sup>42</sup></a> Declaimers of course must especially consider what best suits each character; for they rarely deliver their speeches as advocates, but generally as sons, parents, rich men, old men, the bad-tempered, the easy-going, misers, the superstitious, cowards or mockers; comic actors hardly have more roles to sustain in their performance than these men do in their speeches.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_141_43" id="target_note_LCL125_141_43"><sup>43</sup></a> All this may be regarded as <span class="italic">prosopopoeia,</span> which I have put under <span class="italic">suasoria,</span> because the only way in which it differs from this is in the character portrayed.

I know of course that both poetical and historical themes are often set as exercises: for example, Priam’s words to Achilles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_141_44" id="target_note_LCL125_141_44"><sup>44</sup></a> or Sulla resigning the dictatorship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_141_45" id="target_note_LCL125_141_45"><sup>45</sup></a> in the public assembly. But these will come under one or other of the three Types into which we divided Causes.
