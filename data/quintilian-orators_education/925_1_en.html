and this distinctiveness is as obvious to the ear as the distinctiveness of the face is to the eye.</p>
<p>The good qualities of the voice, as of everything else, are improved by training and impaired by neglect or lack of knowledge. But the proper regime for the orator is not that of the voice-trainer,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_95_13" id="target_note_LCL494_95_13"><sup>13</sup></a> though these two professions have many needs in common: first, a robust physique, to save the voice from dwindling to the feeble shrillness of eunuchs, women, and invalids (this can be assured by walking, rubbing with oil, sexual abstinence, and easy digestion—in other words, a frugal life);<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_95_14" id="target_note_LCL494_95_14"><sup>14</sup></a> and secondly, a healthy throat—that is to say a soft and smooth one—for any defect here produces a voice which is broken, muffled, harsh, or cracked. This is because, just as pipes produce various sounds from the same volume of breath, according to whether the apertures are closed or open or the instrument clogged or cracked, so also a swollen throat stifles the voice, a blocked throat muffles it, inflammation makes it hoarse, and strain can disrupt it like a broken set of pipes. The breath may also be divided by some obstacle, as a little stream is by a stone, where the current may indeed reunite a little further on, but leaves an empty space in the rear of the obstacle itself. Excess of moisture impedes the voice; total loss of moisture destroys it. Fatigue affects the voice (as it does the body in general) not only at the moment of exertion, but also later on.</p>
