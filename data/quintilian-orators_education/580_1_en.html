the Law is certain in one respect, doubtful in another. “The son of a prostitute shall not speak in the assembly.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_267_2" id="target_note_LCL126_267_2"><sup>2</sup></a> A woman who had a son began to work as a prostitute. The young man is barred from the assembly.” There is no doubt about the son of a woman who was a prostitute before he was born. The doubt is whether the same applies in this man’s case, although he <span class="italic">is</span> her son and she <span class="italic">is</span> a prostitute. Another Question frequently raised is what the text of a law refers to. “There shall not be an action twice on the same matter.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_267_3a" id="target_note_LCL126_267_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> Does “twice” apply to the prosecutor or to the prosecution? These points arise from obscurity in the law.</p>
<p>A second type arises when the law is clear. Those who have thought this to be the only type have named it “Issue of Express Meaning and Intention.” In this, one party relies on the Letter, the other on the Spirit. There are three ways of attacking the Letter. (1) One is used when it is clear from the text itself that it cannot always be observed. “Children must support their parents or be imprisoned.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_267_4" id="target_note_LCL126_267_4"><sup>4</sup></a> No infant will be put in chains! At this point, there will be a transition to other exceptions. Division: “Does it apply to anyone who has failed to give support? Does it apply to this man? Does it apply when there are these reasons?” (2) Some set a type of <span class="italic">controversia</span> in which there is no Argument which can be derived from the law itself, but the only Question concerns the subject of the dispute. “If a foreigner goes up on the wall, he is to be punished with death. When the enemy scaled the wall, a foreigner drove them
