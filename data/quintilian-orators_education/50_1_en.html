<p>The pronoun also possesses gender, number, and case, all of which admit this type of error.</p>
<p>Solecisms—and in great numbers—arise in respect of the parts of speech; but it is not enough simply to teach this, lest the boy should think that the only fault is to put one part of speech for another, verb where noun should be, or adverb where pronoun should be, and the like. For there are some words which are, as they say, “cognate,” that is belonging to the same genus, and anyone who uses the wrong species is no less at fault than if he had made a change of genus. Thus <span class="italic">an</span> and <span class="italic">aut</span> are both conjunctions: but it is wrong to ask a question in the form <span class="italic">hic aut ille sit</span>;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_149_56" id="target_note_LCL124_149_56"><sup>56</sup></a> <span class="italic">ne</span> and <span class="italic">non</span> are adverbs, but to say <span class="italic">non feceris</span> for <span class="italic">ne feceris</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_149_57" id="target_note_LCL124_149_57"><sup>57</sup></a> is to fall into the same fault, because <span class="italic">non</span> negates and <span class="italic">ne</span> forbids. Again, <span class="italic">intro</span> and <span class="italic">intus</span> are adverbs of place, but <span class="italic">eo intus</span> and <span class="italic">intro sum</span> are Solecisms.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_149_58" id="target_note_LCL124_149_58"><sup>58</sup></a> Similar things can happen with different pronouns, interjections, and prepositions.</p>
<p>A Solecism in speech, in fact, is the internally inconsistent disposition of the preceding and following elements of a single syntactical structure.</p>
<p>However, there are expressions which have the appearance of Solecism but cannot be treated as faults: <span class="italic">tragoedia Thyestes, ludi Floralia ac Megalesia;</span> these last are universal in the older writers, but later became obsolete.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_149_59" id="target_note_LCL124_149_59"><sup>59</sup></a> They can therefore be called Figures, frequent in the poets but not forbidden to orators.
