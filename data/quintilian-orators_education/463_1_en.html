as tears.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_33_19" id="target_note_LCL126_33_19"><sup>19</sup></a> When time eases even real sorrows, the image of sorrow that we make by our words must vanish more quickly still. If we linger over this image, the listener grows tired of the tears, takes a rest, and returns from his temporary excitement to a rational frame of mind. So let us not let the effect go cold, but abandon the pathos once we have brought it to its highest point, and not expect anyone to grieve long for the troubles of others. This is why the tone of our speech should rise particularly (but not exclusively) in this part, because any failure to enhance what went before seems rather to weaken it; declining emotion easily disappears altogether.</p>
<p>Not only words, but some actions are used to produce tears. Hence the practice of bringing the accused into court dirty and unkempt, and their children and parents with them,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_33_20" id="target_note_LCL126_33_20"><sup>20</sup></a> while we see the prosecution displaying the bloody sword, the bits of bone taken from the wound, the blood-bespattered clothing, the unbandaging of the wounds, the stripped bodies with the marks of the scourge. These things commonly make an enormous impression, because they confront people’s minds directly with the facts. This is how Caesar’s toga, carried in his funeral, covered in blood, drove the Roman people to fury.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_33_21" id="target_note_LCL126_33_21"><sup>21</sup></a> It was known that he had been killed; his body lay on the bier; but it was the clothing, wet with blood, that made the image of the crime so vivid that Caesar seemed not to have been murdered, but to be being murdered there and then.</p>
