include simple repetition (<span class="italic">geminatio</span>), various kinds of Anaphora and Epanaphora, <span class="italic">regressio</span> (36), all sorts of combinations of such effects, and finally Climax (54–57). Figures based on Subtraction (<span class="italic">detractio</span>) occupy less space (58–65). The interesting <span class="italic">paradiastolē</span> (65), which depends on the meanings of words, is introduced here; but, as Quintilian says, it is not a Figure in his sense.</p>
<p>Most sound figures (<span class="italic">Klangfiguren,</span> “Gorgianic” Figures) are clearly matters of word order. They are discussed at length in 3.66–86. Here we find Parison (76), Homoeoteleuton (77), Homoeoptoton (78), and finally Antitheton (81) and its subspecies. More than enough already, says Quintilian (87); but, for the sake of completeness, he adds (as in 9.2) some others, which are not in Cicero but found in other authorities (Cornificius (see General Introduction, vol. I) and Rutilius). The chapter ends (100–102) with a plea for moderation and appropriateness: most of these Figures were meant to give pleasure, and are not suitable where sincere emotion is demanded.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Compositio</span> (σύνθεσις ὀνoμάτων, word arrangement), which is the subject of 9.4, is naturally connected with those Figures in which the patterning of the words is decisive. It is an important and complex subject which has generated a particularly vast modern literature, because the appreciation of it is extremely difficult for us, not only on account of our necessarily inadequate knowledge of Latin, but because the notion of “rhythmical” prose is unfamiliar and has been somewhat disconcerting to many readers. We have to remember that, though the Middle Ages had their accentual <span class="italic">cursus</span> based on classical models, the rules of classical Greek and Latin prose rhythm were unknown in the Renaissance and have had to be painfully, and not
