Cicero does this in the <span class="italic">Pro Oppio</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_401_65" id="target_note_LCL125_401_65"><sup>65</sup></a>—“Was it when he had attacked Cotta or when he tried to kill himself that the weapon was snatched from his hands?”—and in the <span class="italic">Pro Vareno</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_401_66" id="target_note_LCL125_401_66"><sup>66</sup></a> “You have a choice; do you want to prove that Varenus chose that route by chance, or that he did so at this man’s persuasion and inducement?”—and he then proceeds to make both alternatives work against the prosecution. Sometimes two propositions are put forward in such a way that the choice of either leads to the same conclusion: for example “We must philosophize &lt;even though we must not philosophize&gt;,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_401_67a" id="target_note_LCL125_401_67a"><sup>67</sup></a> or the common puzzle: “What is the use of a Figure, if it is understood? And what is its use if it is not understood?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_401_68" id="target_note_LCL125_401_68"><sup>68</sup></a> or “The man who can bear pain will lie under torture, the man who cannot will also lie.”</p>
