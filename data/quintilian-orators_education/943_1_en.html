<span class="label"><span class="italic">Gestures which mimic action</span></span>
<p>The Gestures of which I have been speaking all appear to be natural concomitants of <span class="italic">words</span>. There are others however which express <span class="italic">things</span> by mimicry. For example, you can suggest a sick man by imitating a doctor feeling the pulse, or a lyre-player by shaping your hands as if you were striking the strings. You should refrain altogether from such things in pleading. An orator has to be very different from a dancer;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_131_56" id="target_note_LCL494_131_56"><sup>56</sup></a> he must adapt his Gesture to his sense more than to his words—which indeed was the practice of the more serious actors too. I would readily let him move his hand towards himself when he speaks about himself, or towards a person whom he wishes to point out, and a few things like that; but I do not approve of his miming attitudes and making a visual display of whatever he says.</p>
<p>This caution applies not only to the hands, but to the whole range of Gesture and voice. If you are reading the period “There in his slippers stood the praetor of the Roman people,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_131_57" id="target_note_LCL494_131_57"><sup>57</sup></a> you should not mime Verres leaning on his lady-friend; nor, in “He was beaten in the middle of the square at Messana,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_131_58" id="target_note_LCL494_131_58"><sup>58</sup></a> should you squirm as though you were being given a flogging, or drag out of yourself the sort of cry that is extorted by pain. It seems to me that comic actors also make a bad mistake when, though playing a young man, they nevertheless have, in a Narrative, to report the words of an old man (as in the prologue of the <span class="italic">The Water Pot</span>)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_131_59" id="target_note_LCL494_131_59"><sup>59</sup></a> or a woman (as in the <span class="italic">The Farmer</span>),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_131_60" id="target_note_LCL494_131_60"><sup>60</sup></a> and accordingly pronounce these sections in a trembling and womanish voice. Thus one sort of faulty imitation can be found even in those whose whole art consists of imitation!</p>
