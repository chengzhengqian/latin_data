<p>It has generally been taught that an Argument should be agreed: for how can doubtful propositions be proved by doubtful propositions? However, some things which we adduce to prove something else need to be proved themselves. “You killed your husband, for you were an adulteress”: we have to prove the adultery first, so that, when this is certain, it can become an Argument for an uncertain fact. “Your spear was found in the body of the murdered man”: he says it was not his; to make this support our Proof, we have to prove that it was. In this connection, it is essential to observe that there are no firmer propositions than those which were doubtful and have now become certain. “You committed the murder, your clothes were covered with blood”: this is not such a weighty Argument if he admits it as if it is proved against him. For if he admits it, there are many reasons why his clothes could have got blood on them; if he denies it, he makes his Cause hinge on this, and if he is beaten here he falls down also in what follows, since it will be thought that he would not have lied in his denial unless he had despaired of being able to explain the fact satisfactorily if he had admitted it.</p>
<p>The strongest Arguments should be pressed individually, the weaker ones massed together, because it is wrong to let naturally strong points be obscured by their context and their qualities concealed, whereas the naturally weaker points are supported by the help they give one another. So Arguments which cannot have force on the ground of their importance may acquire it by strength of numbers; but make sure they all tend to prove the same thing! Suppose, for example, a man is said to have murdered another for an inheritance: “You hoped for an inheritance, a great inheritance, and you were poor, and your
