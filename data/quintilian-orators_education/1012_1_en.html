<p>To sum up, the advocate best at getting up the case is the sceptic. The client makes all sorts of promises: the public will be his witness, he has the sealed documents absolutely ready, even his opponent will not deny this and that. One must therefore examine every document in the case; it is not enough to see it, it will have to be read through. Very often, the promised documents either do not exist or contain less than was claimed, or include some potentially damaging fact, or say too much and lose credibility because of this. You will often find broken threads, wax tampered with, and seals not validated by a witness;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_269_2" id="target_note_LCL494_269_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and unless you have gone into all this in private, it will trip you up unexpectedly in court, and the abandonment of the document will do more harm than if it had never been promised.</p>
<p>An advocate will also unearth many points which the litigant thought irrelevant to the Cause, if he goes systematically through all the Topics of Argument which we teach.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_269_3" id="target_note_LCL494_269_3"><sup>3</sup></a> It is of course, for reasons already mentioned,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_269_4" id="target_note_LCL494_269_4"><sup>4</sup></a> undesirable to review and test these one by one in the course of the pleading; but in getting up the case it is essential to ferret out the characters, times, places, background, documents, and in general everything from which one can not only derive oneâ€™s technical proofs but also discover which witnesses are to be feared and how they are to be refuted. It makes a great difference whether a defendant has to contend with envy, with hatred, or with contempt; generally speaking envy attacks superiors, hatred equals, and contempt inferiors.</p>
