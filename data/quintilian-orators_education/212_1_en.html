<p>A simple Cause, even if it is defended by various means, cannot have more than one Issue on which judgement is to be given, and the Issue of the Cause will be found in the point which the speaker most wishes to gain and the judge understands to be most worthy of his attention. This is what the Cause will rest upon. On the other hand, there may be different Issues of Questions. To show this by a brief example: when a defendant says “Even if I did it, I was right to do it,” he is using the Issue of Quality; but when he adds “But in fact I didn’t do it,” he introduces Conjecture. But it is always a stronger defence to say “I didn’t do it,” and my view therefore will be that the Issue lies in the position which I should take up if I were not allowed to have more than one position.</p>
