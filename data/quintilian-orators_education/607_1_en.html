many words where one would make it clear, and often think it better to drop a hint than to speak out straight. Of course, no one is content with the proper word nowadays, when there is held to be no merit in anything that someone else might have said! We borrow figures or metaphors from the most decadent of the poets, and take it that the unique sign of genius is needing a genius to understand us. And yet Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_321_7" id="target_note_LCL126_321_7"><sup>7</sup></a> had laid down quite clearly that the greatest fault in public speaking was to distance oneself from ordinary language and our normal instinctive usage. But Cicero was a rude ignoramus; <span class="italic">we</span> have better ideas, we who look with distaste on anything that Nature dictates, we who seek not ornament but meretricious finery, and behave as though words could possess virtue without cohering with their subject! If we have to labour all our lives just to ensure that our words are correct, lucid, elegant, and properly arranged, the whole fruit of our studies has been lost! And yet you can find many people puzzling over individual words, first to discover them and then to weigh and measure their discoveries. Even if the purpose of this was to ensure that they always used the best words, this unhappy preoccupation would be something to reject with disgust, because it both checks the natural movement of speech and puts out the fire of the imagination by producing delay and loss of confidence. An orator who cannot bear to lose a single word is a poor creatureâ€”a pauper, one might say. But he will not even need to lose one, if he has first grasped the principles of Elocution, next furnished himself with copious verbal resources by extensive and appropriate reading, brought skill in Composition to bear on this, and finally strengthened all his accomplishments by persistent practice, so that they are always ready at hand
