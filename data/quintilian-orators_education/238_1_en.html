<p>However, just as Encomium employed on practical occasions needs proofs, so even the kind which is composed for display sometimes contains some semblance of proof. A speaker who tells how Romulus was the son of Mars and was reared by the she-wolf<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_105_7" id="target_note_LCL125_105_7"><sup>7</sup></a> might offer as proofs of his divine origin (1) that, when thrown into the running river, he could not drown; (2) that his actions were all such as to make it credible that he was the son of the god of war; and (3) that his contemporaries had no doubt that he was himself in person taken up to heaven. Some arguments will even come into the sphere of defence; for example, if the orator, in praising Hercules, excuses him for having changed clothes with the Queen of Lydia and (as the story goes) spun the wool that she ordered him to spin.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_105_8" id="target_note_LCL125_105_8"><sup>8</sup></a> But the proper function of Encomium is to amplify and to embellish.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_105_9" id="target_note_LCL125_105_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>The material is of course mainly to do with gods and men, but it can also be other animals and even inanimate objects. With gods, in general, the first thing will be to show veneration of the majesty of their nature; next, to expound the power of each and discoveries of his which have benefited humanity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_105_10a" id="target_note_LCL125_105_10a"><sup>10</sup></a> “Power” will be displayed: for example, in Jupiter, the power of universal rule; in Mars, the power of war; and in Neptune, control of the sea. Inventions will be shown too: the arts for Minerva, letters for Mercury, medicine for Apollo, crops for Ceres, wine
