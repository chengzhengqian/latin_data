This Question does not, as some have thought, invariably precede the trial, as in the detailed consultation of the praetors<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_263_1" id="target_note_LCL126_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when there is a doubt about the accuser’s legal position, but very often has a place in the trial itself. There are two situations requiring such discussions, since either the prosecution’s claim or the Prescription may be controversial. Some have made a separate Issue of Prescription—as though it did not involve all the same Questions as any other legal Issue!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_263_2" id="target_note_LCL126_263_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>(1) When the dispute turns on a Prescription, there is no need to inquire into the facts of the case. A son puts in a Prescription against his father because the latter has forfeited his citizen rights.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_263_3" id="target_note_LCL126_263_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The adjudication bears only on whether he is allowed to do this.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_263_4" id="target_note_LCL126_263_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Whenever we can, however, we must try to get the judge to think favourably also of the facts, because that will make him more ready to be kind to our point of law. For example, in undertakings arising out of interdicts,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_263_5" id="target_note_LCL126_263_5"><sup>5</sup></a> even if the Question is not one of proprietorship but only of occupation, we shall need to prove not only that we were in occupation but that it was our own property that we occupied.</p>
<p>(2) Even more frequently, the Question relates to a prosecution claim. “The war hero shall choose what he will.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_263_6" id="target_note_LCL126_263_6"><sup>6</sup></a> I deny that he should be given whatever he chooses. I have no ground for a Prescription, but I use the Spirit
