unhappy I am! You, Milo, with these men’s help, were able to restore me to my country; shall not I, also with their help, be able to keep you here in yours?” This is particularly appropriate if, as on that occasion, pleas for mercy are not in keeping with the character of the accused. Who would have tolerated a Milo begging for his own life, when he had admitted that he had killed a man of noble birth because it had been right to do so? Thus Cicero sought good will for his client on the ground of his lofty character, and then came forward to shed the tears in his place.</p>
<p>It is in these passages particularly that good service is done by Prosopopoeiae, that is to say fictitious speeches of other persons. When an advocate speaks for a client, the bare facts produce the effect; but when we pretend that the victims themselves are speaking, the emotional effect is drawn also from the persons. The judge no longer thinks that he is listening to a lament for somebody else’s troubles, but that he is hearing the feelings and the voice of the afflicted, whose silent appearance alone moves him to tears; and, as their pleas would be more pitiful if only they could make them themselves, so to a certain extent the pleas become more effective by being as it were put into their mouths, just as the same voice and delivery of the stage actor produces a greater emotional impact because he speaks behind a mask. Cicero again, though he does not put entreaties into Milo’s mouth, and prefers to stress his high courage, has nevertheless given him a complaint which is not inappropriate even to a brave man: “So my labours were undertaken in vain! O my deceitful hopes! O my fruitless plans!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_31_18" id="target_note_LCL126_31_18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Appeals to pity, however, must never be long. There is good reason for the saying that nothing dries as easily
