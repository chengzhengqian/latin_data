<p>The Prooemium first (1–6) selects the most important points in Books Two to Seven, and then (13–33) stresses the importance of Elocution (<span class="italic">elocutio</span>), in other words the verbal expression of the thoughts which the speaker has “discovered” and “arranged.”</p>
<p>For the general background of ancient stylistic theory, see (e.g.) G. A. Kennedy in <span class="italic">CHLC</span> 1. 188–199; G. A. Rowe in <span class="italic">CRHP</span> 121–157; Russell, <span class="italic">CA</span> chap. 9.</p>
<p>Quintilian’s account (compare 1.5.1) is based on the four virtues (<span class="italic">aretai</span>), an Aristotelian concept (<span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 3. 1407a19) developed by Theophrastus (frs. 681–704 Fortenbaugh) and standard in most later writers, including Cicero. They are:</p>
<p>(1) Correctness (8.1; Lausberg §§ 463–527).</p>
<p>(2) Lucidity or Clarity (8.2; Lausberg §§ 528–537).</p>
<p>(3) Ornament (8.3–10.7; Lausberg §§ 538–1054). This includes Tropes, Figures, Composition, and the use of reading and imitation to develop stylistic facility.</p>
<p>(4) Propriety or Decorum (11.1; Lausberg §§ 1055–1062).</p>
<p>8.1 naturally refers back to the grammar teaching advocated in Book One, adding only the need to adhere to good Latin usage. Quintilian adduces the stories of Theophrastus’ hyper-Atticism and Livy’s “Patavinity.”</p>
