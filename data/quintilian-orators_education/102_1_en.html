richer, and the public crier<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_253_4" id="target_note_LCL124_253_4"><sup>4</sup></a> earns more by <span class="italic">his</span> voice! I do not want to have a reader even who will calculate the return on his studies. But the man who, by some divine instinct, has formed a real concept of eloquence, who sets before his eyes that “speech, queen of the world,” of which the famous tragic poet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_253_5" id="target_note_LCL124_253_5"><sup>5</sup></a> speaks, and who seeks that enduring reward which does not depend on fortune, not in the fees of advocacy but in his own heart and contemplation and knowledge—<span class="italic">he</span> will easily persuade himself to spend the time which is wasted in the theatre or the Campus, in gaming or idle talk—not to say sleep and long-drawn-out dinners—in listening to the geometrician and the teacher of music. How much greater will be the delight he gets from these than from those uneducated pleasures! It was a gift of Providence to mankind, that the truly good should give us the greater pleasure.</p>
<p>But the charm of all this has made me go on too long. So much, then, for the studies in which the boy is to be trained before he is capable of greater things. The next book will make a new beginning, as it were, and pass on to the duties of the rhetor.</p>
