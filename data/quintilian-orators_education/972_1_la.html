(12.8); and how he should behave in court (12.9). Quintilian’s pupil Pliny (<span class="italic">Epist.</span> 6.29) discusses some of these matters in a similar spirit.</p>
<p>12.10 is unexpected: it remains, says Quintilian, to speak <span class="italic">de genere orationis</span> (12.10.1). <span class="italic">Oratio</span> here is, according to Quintilian, the “work,” as distinct from the “workman” (whose qualifications and tools we have discussed) and the “craft” or “art,” which has been the subject of the whole <span class="italic">Institutio</span> (see General Introduction in Vol. I). We have therefore, in this place, a discussion of types of style of the kind more usually found in the context of <span class="italic">elocutio</span> (as in Demetrius, <span class="italic">On style</span> and in <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span>). It is an important and difficult chapter.</p>
<p>First, having explained his procedure, Quintilian draws an analogy between types of <span class="italic">oratio</span> and types of sculpture (1–2). This leads him to a historical sketch of the development of painting and sculpture (3–9). On this see J. J. Pollitt, <span class="italic">The Ancient View of Greek Art</span> (1974) 81–84. Quintilian and Cicero (<span class="italic">Brutus</span> 70) appear to have a common source in this, and their account is different from that in Pliny (<span class="italic">Nat. Hist.</span> 34–36). In particular, Greek sculpture culminates in Phidias (as it does for Quintilian’s contemporary, Dio of Prusa, in his <span class="italic">Olympic Oration</span> (<span class="italic">Or.</span> 12)).</p>
<p>The development of oratory comes next (10–15), and Quintilian carries the story down as far as Cicero. This has led him to the concepts of “Asianism” and “Atticism,” because these terms were of concern to Cicero (12–15); he therefore proceeds to enlarge on this division (16–26), mentioning also the intermediate Rhodian school (18). Few topics in this area have been more widely discussed than this, ever since Wilamowitz’s article in <span class="italic">Hermes</span> 1900, 1–52 (reprinted in Stark (1968) 350–401), which remains a
