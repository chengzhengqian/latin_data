continuous reading passes at the same speed over passages which stick in the mind and those which do not. In testing whether you retain something, you employ greater concentration without wasting the extra time usually spent on going over also what is already known. On this method, only the forgotten parts are revised, with a view to fixing them by frequent repetition—though the mere fact that we forgot them often makes them stick particularly well. Learning by heart and writing have in common that both are greatly assisted by good health, good digestion, and a mind free of other distractions.</p>
<p>But it is Division and Composition which are important factors in memorizing what we have written, and almost uniquely important factors (apart of course from practice, which is the most potent of all) in helping to retain what we compose mentally. The man who has got his Division right will never be able to make mistakes in the order of his ideas. This is because what comes first, second, and so on, not only in the original layout of the Questions but in their development, provides fixed points (if, of course, our speech follows the straightforward order), and the entire structure thus hangs together so that nothing can be removed or inserted without this becoming obvious. Scaevola, who had been playing Twelve Rows,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_77_18" id="target_note_LCL494_77_18"><sup>18</sup></a> and had been beaten despite having made the first move, went over the whole course of the game on his way to his country estate, remembered where he had gone wrong, and returned to his opponent, who admitted that that was what had happened! How then can order be any less important in a speech, where it is wholly determined by our own decision, when it is so important in a game where you only make one decision in two?</p>
