him a written defence, he refused to use it, thinking it good but not suitable for him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_15_8" id="target_note_LCL494_15_8"><sup>8</sup></a> This instance alone shows that the end the orator must keep in view is not to persuade but to speak well, for persuading can sometimes be dishonourable. His action did nothing for his acquittal but, more importantly, it did much for him as a human being.</p>
<p>In drawing a distinction between the Expedient and the Becoming, I too am following the common usage of language rather than the strict rule of truth. Or are we to think that the elder Africanus failed to see what was to his advantage, when he preferred to leave the country rather than wrangle about his innocence with some wretched tribune of the plebs?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_15_9" id="target_note_LCL494_15_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Or that Publius Rutilius did not know what was in his own interests when he chose his almost Socratic form of defence, or again when he preferred to remain in exile despite Sulla’s invitation to him to return?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_15_10" id="target_note_LCL494_15_10"><sup>10</sup></a> These men regarded the little things which every small mind believes to be expedient as contemptible in comparison with virtue. They are rewarded for this by the undying admiration of posterity. So let us too not be so smallminded as to regard the deeds we praise as inexpedient. However, very rarely will this conflict, such as it is, come our way. In general, as I said, the Expedient and the Becoming will be identical in every type of Cause.</p>
