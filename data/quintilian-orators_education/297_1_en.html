It is for the other party to explain why these sums are not due. (2) It is both sufficient and more expedient for the plaintiff to say: “I declare that Horatius killed his own sister.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_223_9" id="target_note_LCL125_223_9"><sup>9</sup></a> For here the judge comes to know the whole charge from this Proposition, while the sequence of events and the motive rather favour the other side. A defendant, on the other hand, will dispense with a Narrative when the charge can neither be denied nor mitigated, but rests wholly on a question of law: for example, in the case of the man who is accused of sacrilege when he has stolen private money from a temple,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_223_10" id="target_note_LCL125_223_10"><sup>10</sup></a> a confession is more decent than a Narrative: “We do not deny that money was removed from the temple, but the prosecutor is making a false charge by bringing an action for sacrilege, since the money was private, not religious, property.

<p>While I agree that there are sometimes these reasons for leaving out the Narrative, I do not agree with those who hold that there is no Narrative when the defendant merely denies the charge. This is the view of Cornelius Celsus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_223_11" id="target_note_LCL125_223_11"><sup>11</sup></a> who holds that most cases of murder and all cases of bribery and extortion are of this kind. He thinks that a Narrative must contain the essential facts of the charge before the court. Yet he himself proceeds to acknowledge that Cicero has a Narrative in the <span class="italic">Pro Rabirio Postumo</span>; Cicero however denied that any money came into Rabirius’ hands (that is what the inquiry was about) and said nothing in this Narrative about the charge. My own view—and I follow normally reliable authorities<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_223_12" id="target_note_LCL125_223_12"><sup>12</sup></a> in this—is that there are two types of Narrative in forensic cases, one involving the exposition of the Cause itself, the other the exposition of
