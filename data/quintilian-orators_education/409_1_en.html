<p>The main question regarding this type therefore is whether the thing produced for comparison is in fact similar. Even in the Socratic interrogations which I mentioned just now, one must be careful not to give a rash answer. Xenophon’s wife, in Aeschines the Socratic, gave a poor answer to Aspasia, which Cicero translates as follows:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_447_38" id="target_note_LCL125_447_38"><sup>38</sup></a> “‘Tell me, wife of Xenophon, if the woman next door had better gold ornaments than you have, would you &lt;rather have&gt; hers &lt;or yours&gt;?’ ‘Hers,’ she replied. ‘And if she had more expensive clothing and other women’s ornaments than you, would you &lt;prefer&gt; yours or hers?’ &lt;‘Hers,’ she replied.&gt; ‘Well then, if she had a better husband than you have, would you prefer your husband or hers?’” Here the lady blushed, and very properly; for she had wrongly answered that she would rather have the other wife’s gold than her own; and this is not decent. If she had answered that she would prefer her gold to be like the other wife’s, she could have answered with perfect modesty that she would prefer her husband to be like the better man.</p>
<p>I know that some, with pointless precision, have subdivided all these things into minute parts, and said that some things are “less similar” (for example, a monkey or a roughly blocked out marble statue, compared to the human form), some things “more similar” (“an egg is not so like an egg as . . .”);<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_447_39" id="target_note_LCL125_447_39"><sup>39</sup></a> again, there are “similitudes in dissimilars,” as between an ant and an elephant, both being animals; and “dissimilitudes in similars,” as between “dogs</p>
