<p>He does not of course use these examples, because, writing to Trebatius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_399_61" id="target_note_LCL125_399_61"><sup>61</sup></a> he preferred examples from law; I have substituted plainer ones.</p>
<p>Properties also have a part to play in Conjecture: thus, since it is a Property of a good man to act rightly, and of an angry man to act &lt;wrongly&gt;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_399_62" id="target_note_LCL125_399_62"><sup>62</sup></a> in word &lt;or deed&gt;, we believe that &lt;certain acts were committed by them&gt; or not, as the case may be. For just as certain persons necessarily &lt;possess&gt; certain qualities, &lt;so others necessarily&gt; do not. The principle is the same, though it is based on opposite premises.</p>
<p>Division operates by a similar method both in Proof and in Refutation. For Proof, it is sometimes enough to establish one point: “To be a citizen, a man must either be born one or be made one.” The demolition must refute both points: “He was neither born a citizen nor made one.” This is done in various ways, and forms the class of Arguments by Elimination, by which means sometimes all the possibilities are proved false, and sometimes a remaining alternative is proved true. (1) All false: “You say you lent the money; you either had it yourself, or received it from somebody, or found it, or stole it. If you did not have it at home and you did not receive it from somebody”—and so forth—“you did not lend it.” (2) Remaining alternative true: “This slave, whom you claim, is either your home-born slave, or was bought, or given to you, or left to you as a legacy, or captured from the enemy, or belongs to someone else.” When the rest are eliminated, only “belonging to someone else” will remain. This is a risky procedure and needs to be watched carefully, because, if we leave out any one alternative in setting out the list, the whole thing is destroyed—and dissolves in general laughter. A safer proce­dure
