<p>The points to be recapitulated here must be treated as briefly as possible and (as the Greek word shows) we must run quickly through all the “headings,” for if we spend too much time, it will become almost a second speech rather than an “enumeration.” On the other hand, the points which we think should be enumerated must be treated with a certain weight, enlivened by apt <span class="italic">sententiae,</span> and of course diversified by Figures; otherwise, nothing is more off-putting than the straightforward repetition of facts, which suggests a lack of confidence in the judges’ memory. Possible Figures are innumerable. Cicero has an excellent one in the speech against Verres:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_19_3" id="target_note_LCL126_19_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “If your father were sitting in judgement, what would he say when these facts were proved?”—and he then tacked the enumeration on to this. In the same prosecution, again,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_19_4" id="target_note_LCL126_19_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Cicero uses an invocation of the gods to shape his list of the temples despoiled by the governor. We can also ask ourselves whether we have forgotten something,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_19_5" id="target_note_LCL126_19_5"><sup>5</sup></a> how our opponent will answer this or that, or what hope the prosecution can have when all the charges have been so thoroughly countered. The most satisfactory thing is if you are in a position to derive an Argument from your opponent: for example, “he left out this part of the Cause,” or “he preferred to harry us by rousing hostile feelings,” or “he was right to beg for mercy, when he knew this or that.” But I must not list the individual varieties, lest those I happen to mention now are thought to be the only possible ones; the fact is rather that opportunities arise out of Causes, opponents’ remarks, and even some accidental circumstances.</p>
<p>We need not confine ourselves to going over our own speech; we can ask our opponent to answer some points, though this is only possible if there is still time for him to
