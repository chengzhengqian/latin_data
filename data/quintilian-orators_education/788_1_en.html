views: all the same, these feet will force their way in even on the unwilling, and those writers will not always be able to use their <span class="italic">herous</span> or their favourite Paean, which they praise so much because it is rarely the basis of verse. (It is not however the words which make some feet more frequent than others—words cannot be made bigger or smaller or shortened or lengthened at will as in singing—but the transposition and the arrangement of the words, for most feet are formed as a result of the way in which words are joined or separated. This is why different forms of verse can be made out of the same words. I remember a well-known poet writing lines like:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">astra tenet caelum, mare classes, area messem.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_211_89" id="target_note_LCL127_211_89"><sup>89</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Read in reverse, this becomes a Sotadean; and a trimeter can also be made out of a Sotadean in reverse:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1"><span class="italic">caput exeruit mobile pinus repetita</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_211_90a" id="target_note_LCL127_211_90a"><sup>90</sup></a>)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>There should therefore be a mixture of feet, and we should take care that the majority of them are pleasing and the less good hidden among the better ones with which they are surrounded. The nature of letters and syllables cannot of course be changed; what matters is which goes best with which. Thus long syllables, as I said, have most dignity and weight, and short syllables have most rapidity. Mixed with a few long ones, the short run nicely; in a continuous
