<p>For my part (and I have authorities to back me) I hold that the subject matter of rhetoric is everything which is submitted to it for speaking. Socrates in Plato seems to say to Gorgias that the subject matter consists of things, not words,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_409_4" id="target_note_LCL124_409_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and in the <span class="italic">Phaedrus</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_409_5" id="target_note_LCL124_409_5"><sup>5</sup></a> he openly proves that rhetoric is concerned not only with law-courts and assemblies, but also with private and domestic affairs. This shows that this was Plato’s own opinion. Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_409_6" id="target_note_LCL124_409_6"><sup>6</sup></a> too says in one passage that the material of rhetoric is “the things submitted to it,” but he thinks that these are of certain specific kinds. In another passage, however, he thinks that the orator must speak about everything. I quote:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_409_7" id="target_note_LCL124_409_7"><sup>7</sup></a> “although the name of orator and the very claim to speak well seems to imply an undertaking and a promise to speak with elegance and fluency on any subject which may be proposed.” And again elsewhere:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_409_8" id="target_note_LCL124_409_8"><sup>8</sup></a> “It is for the true orator to investigate, hear, read, discuss, handle, and ponder every aspect of human life, since it is in this that he has his being, and this is the matter which is put before him.”</p>
<p>But this “material,” as we call it, in other words the subject of the art, has been said by some to be either “unlimited” or “not peculiar to rhetoric”; they have called it a “runabout” art, because it speaks on every subject. I have no great quarrel with these people. They admit that it speaks about all material, while the reason they give for

The Academic Eudorus of Alexandria (Stobaeus 2.42 Hense) divided ethics into (1) theory of value, (2) study of impulses and emotions, (3) study of action. He does not discuss rhetoric, but his categories of “encouragement, discouragement, and consolation” clearly describe deliberative rhetoric.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL124_409_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL124_409_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL124_409_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>Perhaps <span class="italic">Gorgias</span> 451D.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL124_409_4').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL124_409_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL124_409_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>261A.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL124_409_5').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL124_409_6"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL124_409_6" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">6</sup><span class="italic">De inventione</span> 1.7; cf. <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 1.64–67.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL124_409_6').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL124_409_7"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL124_409_7" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">7</sup><span class="italic">De oratore</span> 1.21.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL124_409_7').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL124_409_8"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL124_409_8" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">8</sup>Ibid. 3.54.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL124_409_8').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
