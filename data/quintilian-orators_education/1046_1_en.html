<p>Plato? How many centuries did Aristotle study in order not only to embrace all the concerns of philosophers and orators, but to investigate all the natural kinds of animals and plants? And these men had to discover these things, while we only have to learn about them! Antiquity has supplied us with all these teachers and models, so that one might well think that there is no age better to be born in than ours, for whose instruction previous ages have worked so hard.
