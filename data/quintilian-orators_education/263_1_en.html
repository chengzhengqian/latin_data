<span class="label"><span class="italic">Types of Causes</span></span>
<p>Every Cause, in which one side is the plaintiff’s and the other the defendant’s, is based either on a Controversy involving a single matter or on one involving several. The first type is called “simple,” the second “compound.” A theft taken by itself or an adultery taken by itself forms a single Controversy. Where there are several charges, these may be of the same kind (for example, in extortion cases) or of different kinds (for example, if a man is accused at the same time of sacrilege and homicide). This does not now happen in the public courts, because the praetor allots cases according to the relevant law, but it often happens in hearings before emperors or the senate, as it did once in trials by the people. Private suits also often tend to have a single judge dealing with many different forms of charge. There will be no types other than these, even if one person makes a claim against two persons (so long as his claims are for the same thing and on the same grounds), or two persons claim against one, or a group against a group (as we know happens sometimes in inheritance cases); for, although many persons may be involved, there is only one Cause, unless the circumstances of the parties prove to have altered the Questions.</p>

But it is rare for cases to be brought in court solely in this form, as
