<p>Cicero has been seriously criticized on this count, though in fact, at least in his speeches, he was more inclined to boast of his political achievements than of his oratory.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_19_12" id="target_note_LCL494_19_12"><sup>12</sup></a> Yet he often had some justification for this also, because he was either defending persons who had assisted him in putting down the Catilinarian conspiracy, or responding to envy (which indeed was too strong for him, and he went into exile for having saved his country), so that the frequent mention of the actions of his consulship can be thought of less as boasting than as self-defence. At any rate, in pleading a case, he never made unreasonable claims for his own eloquence, though he would make handsome admissions of the eloquence of the opposing advocates. It is he who said “Any talent I have, judges, and I know how slight it is,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_19_13" id="target_note_LCL494_19_13"><sup>13</sup></a> and “Lacking the talent, I have helped myself by my industry.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_19_14" id="target_note_LCL494_19_14"><sup>14</sup></a> Indeed, in the speech against Quintus Caecilius, on the selection of the prosecutor of Verres, though the question which was the more capable pleader was indeed of great importance, he did more to detract from his opponent’s claim to eloquence than to press his own, and declared not that he had succeeded in making himself an orator, but that he had done his best to be in a position to do so.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_19_15" id="target_note_LCL494_19_15"><sup>15</sup></a> Sometimes in the familiar tones of his letters to friends, and on occasion in his dialogues (but always in the person of others), he does speak the truth about his own eloquence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_19_16" id="target_note_LCL494_19_16"><sup>16</sup></a> Perhaps however it is actually more tolerable to boast openly, accepting the sheer naïveté of this failing, than to do so with that inverted vanity with which a rich man claims to be poor, an aristocrat obscure, a man of power weak, and a skilled orator incompetent and inarticulate.
