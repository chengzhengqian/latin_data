from a repetition of the same word with a deeper meaning: “Since our enemy is a human being, he is human.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_141_135" id="target_note_LCL127_141_135"><sup>135</sup></a> (I have used these examples for another purpose, but note that Emphasis, Reduplication, and Paronomasia are all present in this passage.) The contrary 〈of this〉 occurs when the use of the same word almost proves something to be false: “This law did not seem a law to private persons.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_141_136" id="target_note_LCL127_141_136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

When Proculeius complained of his son that he was “waiting for” his death, and the son replied that he was not waiting, he retorted “Well, please do wait.”</p>
<p>Sometimes the difference is understood not in relation to the same word but to one close to it, as if you were to say that someone whom you previously judged worthy of a public thanksgiving (<span class="italic">supplicatio</span>) should be subjected to punishment (<span class="italic">supplicium</span>).</p>
<p>There are other ways in which words are used with different meanings, either as they are, or altered merely by lengthening or shortening a vowel. This is a feeble device even as a joke, and I am surprised to see that instructions are given for it. I add examples, to be avoided rather than copied. “It is good to be loved (<span class="italic">amari</span>), if one takes care that there is no bitterness (<span class="italic">amari</span>) in it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_141_138" id="target_note_LCL127_141_138"><sup>138</sup></a> “The sweetness of birds (ă<span class="italic">vium</span>) attracts us in to the wilderness (ā<span class="italic">vium</span>).”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_141_139" id="target_note_LCL127_141_139"><sup>139</sup></a> In Ovid it is a joke:</p>
