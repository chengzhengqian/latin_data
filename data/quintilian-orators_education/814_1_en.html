<span class="label"><span class="italic">Choice of reading: oratory</span></span>
<p>For a long time, the only authors to be read should be the best and the least likely to betray our trust, and they should be read thoroughly, with almost as much care as we devote to writing. We must do more than examine everything bit by bit; once read, the book must invariably be taken up again from the beginning, especially if it is a speech, the virtues of which are often deliberately concealed. The orator often prepares his way, dissembles, lays traps, and says things in the first part of the speech which will prove their value at the end, and are accordingly less striking in their original context, because we do not as yet know why they are said, and therefore have to go back over them when we know the whole text.</p>
<p>The most useful steps are to familiarize oneself with the cases with which the speeches we have taken up are concerned, and, whenever possible, to read the pleadings on both sides, like the opposing speeches of Demosthenes and Aeschines,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_263_10" id="target_note_LCL127_263_10"><sup>10</sup></a> or of Servius Sulpicius and Messala, for and against Aufidia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_263_11" id="target_note_LCL127_263_11"><sup>11</sup></a> or again of Pollio and Cassius in the case of Asprenas,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_263_12" id="target_note_LCL127_263_12"><sup>12</sup></a> and many others. Indeed, even if some such speeches seem badly matched, we shall do well to seek them out with a view to understanding the problems of the case: for example, Tubero’s prosecution of Ligarius against Cicero,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_263_13" id="target_note_LCL127_263_13"><sup>13</sup></a> or Hortensius’ defence of Verres.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_263_14" id="target_note_LCL127_263_14"><sup>14</sup></a> It will also be useful to know how different speakers treated the
