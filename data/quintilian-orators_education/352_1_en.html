the subject of an accusation. But as this implies either fraud or ignorance in the signatories, it is safer and easier to go for the second of these, because there are then fewer persons to be accused. But this too draws Arguments from the Cause, (1) if what the document alleges is unbelievable or (as happens more often) is nullified by other non-technical Proofs; (2) if either the person whose interests are affected by the document or one of the signatories is said to have been absent or to have died before the signing; (3) if the dates do not agree; (4) if either prior or subsequent events conflict with the document. Simple inspection also often reveals a forgery.</p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">Oaths</span></span>
<p>Litigants may either offer to take an oath or decline to accept one offered by an opponent. They may demand one from an opponent or decline to take one when challenged. To offer to take an oath without stipulating that one’s opponent should also take one verges on dishonesty. If a litigant does this, however, he will defend himself either (1) on the ground of his way of life—it is incredible that <span class="italic">he</span> should perjure himself!—or (2) by the very solemnity of the act (this has more credibility if he has taken care to seem, not indeed eager to have recourse to this procedure, but not reluctant either), or (3), if the case allows, by stressing the limited scope of the dispute (he is not going to risk the wrath of the gods for <span class="italic">this</span>!), or (4) by adding to his other means of winning his case the additional safeguard of this further proof of a clear conscience.</p>
