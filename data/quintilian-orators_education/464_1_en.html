<p>I would not however, for this reason, approve a practice of which I have read—and indeed have occasionally seen—of having a picture painted on a board or a canvas, depicting the horrible event of which the judge is to be reminded. What depths of incompetence must there be in a pleader who thinks a dumb image will speak for him better than his own words! Mourning clothes, an unkempt appearance, and relatives similarly attired have, I know, proved of use, and prayers have been known to weigh heavily for an acquittal; therefore appeals to the judges by “all that is near and dear,” especially if the defendant has children, wife, and parents, will also be of service.
