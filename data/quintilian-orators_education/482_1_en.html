However, there was nothing to forbid the composition of themes giving scope for this—that is, the invention of <span class="italic">controversiae</span> with humorous elements—or the setting of special topics to exercise students in this way. The exercises we used to deliver on certain days of holiday licence (they are “sayings,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_71_7" id="target_note_LCL126_71_7"><sup>7</sup></a> and that is what they are called), if constructed somewhat more systematically or with an admixture of seriousness, could have been very useful; as it is they are simply a game for students or persons amusing themselves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_71_8" id="target_note_LCL126_71_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

(3) <span class="italic">Salsus</span> (“salty”) is used in ordinary speech only of the laughable; but it is not by nature necessarily laughable, though anything laughable ought also to be “salty.” For Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_71_9" id="target_note_LCL126_71_9"><sup>9</sup></a> says that everything which is “salty” is a special feature of the Attic writers, but this is not because they are particularly inclined to laughter. And when Catullus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_71_10" id="target_note_LCL126_71_10"><sup>10</sup></a> says “there’s not a grain of salt in
