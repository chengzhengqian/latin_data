namely the Argument by which we are going to prove something, even if not expressed as yet in words, but only formed in the mind.</p>
<p>Some take it that this name is given not to an intended or unfinished proof but to a perfect one of the lowest species;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_369_7" id="target_note_LCL125_369_7"><sup>7</sup></a> and consequently, in the strict and most usual use of the term, it signifies a certain mode of structuring a thought which comprises at least three parts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_369_8" id="target_note_LCL125_369_8"><sup>8</sup></a> Some have rendered <span class="italic">epicheirēma</span> as <span class="italic">ratio</span>; Cicero’s <span class="italic">ratiocinatio</span> is better, though he too seems to have derived the term rather from the Syllogism, since he calls the Syllogistic (Inferential) Issue<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_369_9" id="target_note_LCL125_369_9"><sup>9</sup></a> “ratiocinative,” and uses examples from philosophers. Indeed, as there is a close relationship between Syllogism and Epicheireme, he may be thought to have been right in extending the use of the word like this.</p>
<p>Demonstration (<span class="italic">apodeixis</span>) is a clear proof; hence the term <span class="italic">grammikai apodeixeis</span> (“linear demonstrations”) used by mathematicians.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_369_10" id="target_note_LCL125_369_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Caecilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_369_11" id="target_note_LCL125_369_11"><sup>11</sup></a> thinks that the only difference between this and an Epicheireme lies in the form in which the Argument is concluded, and that the Apodeixis is an imperfect Epicheireme for the same reason that we said that an Enthymeme was different from a Syllogism. [For an Epicheireme is also part of a Syllogism.] Some think that an Apodeixis is inherent in an Epicheireme, and is the part of it which provides the Confirmation. But all authorities, whatever their differences, agree in defining both in the same way, namely as a reasoning which lends credence to what is doubtful by means of what is certain. This indeed is the nature of all Arguments: certainties cannot be proved by uncertainties.</p>
