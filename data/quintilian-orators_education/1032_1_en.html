<p>Some people think that these more animated highlights, though permissible in the speech as spoken, should be excluded from the written text. I must therefore not pass over this point either without discussing it. The fact is that most scholars have held that the principles of speaking are different from those of writing, and that this is why some very eloquent speakers have left nothing for posterity, and nothing to add to the enduring literary heritage of the future (such were Pericles and Demades),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_309_79" id="target_note_LCL494_309_79"><sup>79</sup></a> while on the other hand some—for example Isocrates—were excellent composers in writing, but unfitted for actual pleading.
