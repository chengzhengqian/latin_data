speech; but he lacks strength. If Julius Caesar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_315_146" id="target_note_LCL127_315_146"><sup>146</sup></a> had been free to spend all his time in the courts, no other Roman could have been named as a rival to Cicero. He has the force, the shrewdness, the drive—you can see that he spoke with the same spirit as he waged war—but he dressed all this up in a wonderful elegance of language, of which he made a special study. Caelius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_315_147" id="target_note_LCL127_315_147"><sup>147</sup></a> had much talent, and a notable wit, especially in prosecuting; he deserved a wiser mind and a longer life. I have found some who prefer Calvus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_315_148" id="target_note_LCL127_315_148"><sup>148</sup></a> to all others, and others who believe with Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_315_149" id="target_note_LCL127_315_149"><sup>149</sup></a> that he ruined his real strength by too much self-criticism. His style was solemn, serious, and chaste, often also energetic. He was an imitator of the Attic writers, and his untimely death did his reputation an injury—if, that is, he was on the way to enrich his style, not to impoverish it. Servius Sulpicius too<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_315_150a" id="target_note_LCL127_315_150a"><sup>150</sup></a> deservedly won fame with his three speeches. Cassius Severus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_315_151" id="target_note_LCL127_315_151"><sup>151</sup></a> if read with a critical eye, will provide many things worth imitating; if he had added tone and dignity to his other virtues, he would have to be reckoned among the great. He has a great deal of talent, astonishing asperity, and great wit; but he yielded to his temper more than to his judgement. His humour is bitter, but the bitterness itself is often absurd.</p>
<p>There are many other good speakers, whom it would take too long to list. Of such as I have seen, Domitius Afer<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_315_152" id="target_note_LCL127_315_152"><sup>152</sup></a> and Julius Africanus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_315_153" id="target_note_LCL127_315_153"><sup>153</sup></a> are far the most outstanding.
