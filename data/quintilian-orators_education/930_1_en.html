Conversely, it is sometimes necessary to recover breath without a perceptible pause, in which case it has to be snatched surreptitiously, because if we regain our breath awkwardly, this produces just as much obscurity as faulty punctuation. Virtue of punctuation is perhaps a small thing; but without it there can be no other virtue in a pleading.</p>
<p>(3) Delivery is “ornate” when it is supported by a voice which is fluent, strong, rich, flexible, firm, sweet, durable, clear, pure, cutting through the air and settling in the ear (there is a type of voice well adapted to being heard not because of its volume but because of its special quality), and also, as it were, manageable, having of course all the necessary inflexions and tensions, and being equipped, as they say, with “all the stops.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_105_30" id="target_note_LCL494_105_30"><sup>30</sup></a> There must also be strength in the lungs, and breath that both holds out well and will not easily give way to fatigue.</p>
<p>Neither the deepest nor the highest notes [in music] suit oratory. The lowest notes are indistinct and too full, and cannot impart any emotion to the mind; on the other hand, the very thin and exaggeratedly clear are both beyond the normal range and incapable of variation in Delivery or of bearing strain very long. The voice is indeed like the strings of an instrument: the slacker it is, the deeper and fuller it is; the tighter it is, the thinner and shriller it is.
