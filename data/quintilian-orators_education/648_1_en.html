<p>Another type is based on reference to something which appears to have been said for a different purpose. The chief men of Troy think it no discredit for Greeks and Trojans to endure so many troubles so long for the sake of Helen’s beauty.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_403_14" id="target_note_LCL126_403_14"><sup>14</sup></a> What then must her beauty be believed to be? For it is not Paris, who ravished her, who says this, nor some young man or one of the common people, but the wise old men who are Priam’s counsellors. Even the king himself, exhausted by the ten years’ war, after losing so many children and with the ultimate peril hanging over him, the very man who ought to have loathed and hated the face which had caused so many tears, hears these words, calls her his daughter, makes her sit next to him, and even excuses her to himself and denies that she is the cause of the troubles.

Ajax’ shield and Achilles’ spear-shaft from Pelion are relevant here.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_403_16" id="target_note_LCL126_403_16"><sup>16</sup></a> Vergil used this device admirably for his Cyclops: what size of body am I to imagine in a creature whose “hand is guided by a pine tree’s trunk?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_403_17" id="target_note_LCL126_403_17"><sup>17</sup></a> And what a giant must Demoleos<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_403_18" id="target_note_LCL126_403_18"><sup>18</sup></a> have been, whose “many-layered breastplate” two men “could scarcely carry on their shoulders,” but who wore it when he “chased the scattering Trojans at a run”?
