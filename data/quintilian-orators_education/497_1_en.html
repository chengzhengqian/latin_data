asked Campatius as he left the theatre whether he had seen the play: “No,” he replied, “I was playing ball in the orchestra,” which made the question even stupider.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_101_73" id="target_note_LCL126_101_73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>Refutation consists in Denial, Rebuttal, Justification, Extenuation, &lt;or Transference&gt;. (1) A humorous Denial is seen in a repartee by Quintus Curius. His accuser had painted a picture of him on canvas,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_101_74" id="target_note_LCL126_101_74"><sup>74</sup></a> in which he was shown in every scene as either naked in prison or just rescued by his friends from his gaming debts. He simply said, “Well then, did I never win?” (2) A humorous Rebuttal may be (a) open, as when Cicero refuted Vibius Curius’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_101_75" id="target_note_LCL126_101_75"><sup>75</sup></a> gross lies about his age by saying “In that case, when you and I were declaiming together, you had not been born,” or (b) in the form of a pretended agreement, as when Cicero observed, when Dolabella’s wife Fabia said she was thirty, “It’s true; I’ve heard her say so these twenty years.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_101_76" id="target_note_LCL126_101_76"><sup>76</sup></a> It is sometimes a neat idea to substitute for a charge you are denying something more biting; thus when Domitia, the wife of Passienus, complained that Junius Bassus, in attacking her miserliness, had said she used to sell old shoes, he replied, “No, I never said that; I said you used to <span class="italic">buy</span> them.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_101_77" id="target_note_LCL126_101_77"><sup>77</sup></a> (3) Justification is the model for the remark by the Roman <span class="italic">eques</span> who, accused by Augustus of having squandered his inheritance, replied “I thought it was mine.” (4) Extenuation takes two forms: (a) cutting down a boastful
