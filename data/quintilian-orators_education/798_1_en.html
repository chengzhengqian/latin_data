single thought is deployed in a Period of some length, and one made up of Cola and Commata, which contains several thoughts: <span class="italic">Aderat ianitor carceris, carnifex praetoris,</span> and so on.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_231_138" id="target_note_LCL127_231_138"><sup>138</sup></a> A Period contains at least two Cola.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_231_139" id="target_note_LCL127_231_139"><sup>139</sup></a> An average number seems to be four, but it often allows more. Its extent is fixed by Cicero either by the length of four senarii<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_231_140a" id="target_note_LCL127_231_140a"><sup>140</sup></a> or by the compass of a single breath. It must comprise a complete thought; it must be open and intelligible, and not too long to be retained in the memory.</p>
<p>A Colon which is too long is slow; one that is too short is unstable.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_231_141" id="target_note_LCL127_231_141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<p>Wherever the need is for fierce, insistent, pugnacious speaking, we should speak in Cola and Commata, for this is very effective in oratory: the Composition must also be made to conform to the subject, so that harsh rhythms go with harsh facts and the audience shares the speaker’s horror.</p>
<p>In the Narrative, on the other hand, we shall usually speak in Cola, or loosen up our Periods themselves by having longer pauses and, as it were, less tight knots, except when the Narrative is intended as ornament rather than instruction, like the story of the Rape of Proserpina in <span class="italic">In Verrem,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_231_142" id="target_note_LCL127_231_142"><sup>142</sup></a> where a gentle, flowing texture is appropriate.

Q. uses <span class="italic">senarius</span> properly (of the iambic line) elsewhere (9.4.140), and sowe can hardly suppose he intends it here as a synonym for “hexameter.” So he has perhaps gone his own way in interpreting Cicero: an iambic <span class="italic">senarius</span> is about a third shorter than a dactylic hexameter. Cicero does not in this context mention the restriction produced by breathing: this, together with the awkwardness of <span class="italic">modus . . . modo,</span> gives force to Spalding’s suspicion that there is something wrong with Q.’s text here.
