Their styles are very different, and there is much dispute as to which is the better poet. I leave this question unresolved, because it has nothing to do with my present subject.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_287_71" id="target_note_LCL127_287_71"><sup>71</sup></a> What everybody must admit is that Euripides will be much the more useful to persons preparing themselves to plead in court.

And a careful reading of Menander alone would, in my judgement, be sufficient to develop all the qualities I am recommending: so complete is his representation of life,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_287_75" id="target_note_LCL127_287_75"><sup>75</sup></a> so rich his invention and so fluent his style, so perfectly does he adapt himself to every circumstance, character,
