polished and better finished. I therefore do not believe in tying an orator down to the predecessors of Cato and the Gracchi,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_307_75" id="target_note_LCL494_307_75"><sup>75</sup></a> or even to Cato and the Gracchi themselves. And I observe that Cicero, while putting the whole weight on the practical needs of the case, also allowed entertainment a part, since he used to say he was doing his own business at the same time, while of course he was principally doing his client’s. The pleasure he gave was itself of practical use. For my part, I do not see what can be added to his attractions, except for us to develop more ingenious thoughts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_307_76" id="target_note_LCL494_307_76"><sup>76</sup></a> This can certainly be done, without damaging the management of the Cause or the authority of the speaker, so long as these highlights are not too frequent and continuous or cancel one another out.</p>

But as for what we commonly call <span class="italic">sententiae</span>, which the ancients, and particularly the early Greeks, did not use (I do find them in Cicero), who can deny them usefulness, so long as they have substance, are not overabundant, and contribute to winning the case? They strike the mind, they often knock it over by a single stroke,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_307_78" id="target_note_LCL494_307_78"><sup>78</sup></a> their very brevity makes them more memorable, and the pleasure they give makes them more persuasive.</p>
