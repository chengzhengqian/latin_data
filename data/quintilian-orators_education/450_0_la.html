in general, the “ridiculous” may be seen as dependent either on things or on words (22). (2) It can be used against our opponents, to induce a favourable view of ourselves, or to add a nuance to matters which are not directly connected with either party (23–24). (3) It can be expressed by action (25–26) or by words (26). Circumstances matter; the orator in particular needs to be very careful not to go too far or make jokes at the cost of giving offence or losing his dignity (27–35).</p>
<p>The topics or sources (<span class="italic">loci</span>) of jests are many; in fact they reflect the sources of <span class="italic">sententiae,</span> and involve Invention, Elocution, and Figures (35–36). Thus (37), since ridicule is related to invective, and invective follows the same principles as praise, objects of laughter can be classified as derived from body, mind, or externals. They can be either pointed out, narrated, or marked by a clever word: examples of each follow (38, 39–44, 45–56).</p>
<p>Jokes based on reality are better than those which are purely verbal (57). They can be classified (and Quintilian gives examples) on principles rather like those of argument: similarity (57–63), dissimilarity (63–65), definitions, genus and species, and so on (65–69). Tropes and Figures generate another group of jokes (69–71). Next (72–84) follow various kinds of humorous refutation corresponding roughly to the various Issues. Best of all (84–92) are jokes which depend on surprise or a fresh interpretation of some word. Good temper is important; and there are occasions when one can make a jest against oneself (94–95), or exploit some quotation or learned allusion (96–98). Pretending to be a fool—the “subabsurd”—can also be effective (99); and wit will often allow us to escape embarrassment or respond neatly to insult (100). In 101–102, Quintilian
