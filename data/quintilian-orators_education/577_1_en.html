(1) Measure however sometimes consists of the evaluation of an action—how great is the offence or the service?—and sometimes of a point of law, when what is in dispute is under what law the person is to be punished or honoured: should a rapist pay 10,000 sesterces, which is the penalty fixed for this offence, or, because his victim hanged himself, incur capital punishment as being the cause of death?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_261_45" id="target_note_LCL126_261_45"><sup>45</sup></a> In this type of case it is a mistake to talk as if there were a Question between two laws: there is no dispute about the 10,000 sesterces, which the prosecution does not claim; judgement is given on the Question whether the defendant is the cause of death. This type of case also falls under Conjecture, when the dispute is whether the accused is to be punished with permanent exile or exile for five years;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_261_46" id="target_note_LCL126_261_46"><sup>46</sup></a> for the question here is whether he committed the homicide deliberately. (2) Quantity based on number also depends on law: is Thrasybulus owed thirty rewards?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_261_47" id="target_note_LCL126_261_47"><sup>47</sup></a> When two thieves have stolen money, are they each required to pay quadruple or double the sum?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_261_48" id="target_note_LCL126_261_48"><sup>48</sup></a> But here too the act is evaluated, yet the point of law itself turns on Quality.</p>

<p>A man who neither denies an action nor alleges that what he did was something other than what he is charged with, nor again defends his act, must stand on his legal position; this generally raises the Question of the validity of the proceedings.
