be enough to know that all Proofs are derived either from Persons or from Things (because both of these have numerous subdivisions), still will anyone who has learned that Arguments are to be taken from Antecedent, Contemporaneous, and Subsequent events, be therefore automatically enabled to know what has to be taken from these sources in each particular Cause? Especially as most Proofs are discovered in the actual complexities of Causes, and so have nothing in common with any other dispute! Moreover these are both the strongest and also the least obvious, because we have learned the common ideas from the rules, while points peculiar to the case have to be discovered. Anyway, let us call this type of Argument one “based on circumstances” (there is no other way of translating <span class="italic">peristasis</span>) or “on the special features of the individual Cause.” For example, in the case of the adulterer priest who chose to use his power of saving one life to save his own,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_419_96" id="target_note_LCL125_419_96"><sup>96</sup></a> it is a special feature of the <span class="italic">controversia</span> that we can say “You were saving more than one life, because once <span class="italic">you</span> were spared it was no longer lawful to kill the woman.” (This argument follows from the law which forbids an adulteress to be killed without the adulterer.) Or take the case in which the law is that bankers may pay only a half of what they owe, but may claim the whole of what they are owed, and a banker &lt;claims a debt&gt; from another banker &lt;while his opponent denies that it is legal&gt; for it to be claimed in full.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_419_97a" id="target_note_LCL125_419_97a"><sup>97</sup></a> Peculiar to the theme is the creditor’s Argument, that there was a special reason for the clause in the law allowing a banker to claim the whole; in the case of
