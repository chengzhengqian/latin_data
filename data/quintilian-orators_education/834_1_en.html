<p>In elegy, too, we challenge the Greeks. The most refined and elegant author seems to me to be Tibullus. Some prefer Propertius. Ovid is more self-indulgent than these two, Gallus stiffer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_303_119" id="target_note_LCL127_303_119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>

The first poet to achieve high renown in this genre, Lucilius, still has admirers so devoted to him that they unhesitatingly prefer him not only to other satirists but to all poets.
