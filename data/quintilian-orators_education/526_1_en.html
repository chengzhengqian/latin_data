Sometimes however even this order will be varied, if the lesser charges are obviously false, and the defence of the gravest one more difficult, so that we attack the last point only after discrediting the prosecution, when the judges have come to believe that all the allegations are unfounded. We shall need, however, to make a preliminary statement, giving the reason for the postponement of this charge and promising a defence of it; otherwise by not disposing of it at once we may give the impression that we are afraid of it. Charges against our client’s past life should generally be cleared up first, so that the judge is in a sympathetic frame of mind when he begins to hear the facts on which he is to decide. Cicero, however, in <span class="italic">Pro Vareno</span> postponed this move also to the end, because he had his eyes not on what is generally expedient, but on what was expedient at that moment.</p>
<p>When the charge is simple, we have to consider whether to give a single answer or several. (1) If it is a single answer, shall we raise a Question of fact or of written text? If fact, is the charge to be denied or defended? If a written text, on what special legal situation does the conflict depend, and is it a question of the Letter or of the Spirit? We shall be able to settle these points if we have seen what the law is which gives rise to the dispute, that is, under what law the court has been set up.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_159_9" id="target_note_LCL126_159_9"><sup>9</sup></a> In school exercises, some laws are posited simply to construct the chain
