the imitation of the sounds of the real world (for this latter sense, see Anon. <span class="italic">On Tropes</span> in Spengel 3. 210, 27). It does not fit into any of the categories, and is in any case closely related to the type of verbal Ornament discussed in 8.3.30. Catachresis (6.34–36; <span class="italic">VPH</span> 18; <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 4.45; Cicero, <span class="italic">Orator</span> 94, <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 3.169; Lausberg §§ 562, 577) is a sort of compulsory Metaphor or Synecdoche, used when no proper term is available; it is a <span class="italic">vicinitas</span> trope, as is the next item, Metalepsis (6.37–39; <span class="italic">VPH</span> 21; Lausberg § 571), a complex and rather frivolous device, not much use in practical oratory. Epithet (6.40–43; Aristotle, <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 3.1406a12ff.; <span class="italic">VPH</span> 17; Hermogenes 338,20 Rabe; Lausberg §§ 676–685) is regarded by some not as a Trope at all, and is one only when the epithet acquires a sense of its own, when it is a kind of Antonomasia.</p>
<p>Allegory (6.44–53) and Irony (6.54–58) are famous critical tools. They belong to the group of “contrariety tropes,” because they convey their message by remote and obscure means and may seem to say the opposite of what the speaker intends. For Allegory, see <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 4.46, Demetrius 99–102, <span class="italic">VPH</span> 68–69, and especially “Heraclitus” <span class="italic">Homeric Questions</span> 1–5; Lausberg §§ 895–901). For Irony, compare <span class="italic">VPH</span> 68–69, Trypho 205 Spengel, Cocondrius 3.235 Spengel; Lausberg §§ 902–905. It is also treated as a Figure in Book Nine.</p>
<p>The chapter ends with three other devices, which also have corresponding Figures (on the Trope–Figure distinction, see 9.1): (a) Periphrasis (6.59–61; “Longinus” 28–29; <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 4.44; <span class="italic">VPH</span> 29; Lausberg §§ 716–718); (b) Hyperbaton (6.62–67; <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 4.44; <span class="italic">VPH</span> 30.2; Lausberg §§ 716–718; the concept is first seen in Plato, <span class="italic">Protagoras</span> 343E); (c) Hyperbole (6.67–76; “Longinus” 38;
