<p>let him bear in mind that there are many actions which are made honourable or the reverse not so much because of what was done as because of the motive. If it is often a virtuous act to kill a man, if it is sometimes a very fine action to put one’s own children to death,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_217_27" id="target_note_LCL494_217_27"><sup>27</sup></a> and if deeds which make an even harsher story can be excused on grounds of public interest, then neither must we concentrate on the bare question of what sort of Cause the good man is to defend, but consider also why and with what intention he does it.</p>
<p>First of all, everyone must grant me what even the sternest of the Stoics admit, namely that the good man will go so far as to tell a lie on occasion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_217_28" id="target_note_LCL494_217_28"><sup>28</sup></a> and sometimes even for quite trivial reasons: with sick children, for example, we pretend many things for their good and promise to do many things which we are not going to do; even more justifiably, we lie to stop an assassin from killing a man, and deceive an enemy to save the country. Thus lying, which in some circumstances is blameworthy even in slaves, in others is praiseworthy in the Wise Man himself. If this is agreed, I can see many situations in which an orator might properly undertake a type of Cause which he would not have accepted if there had been no honourable reason for doing so. I am not talking about the defence of a father or a brother or a friend who is at risk—I am resolved to follow stricter rules—although in these cases there can be ample ground for hesitation, because justice is seen to be on one side and loyalty on the other. Let us leave no doubt about the problem. Suppose a man has conspired against a tyrant and is on trial for this. Will the orator, as defined by us, be against the man’s being acquitted? Will he not, if he undertakes the defence, use falsehoods just as much as an advocate
