Figures of Speech (Greek: <span class="italic">schēmata lexeōs</span>), however, are of two kinds; one produces innovations in speech, the other is sought mainly in word arrangement. Although both are relevant to oratory, you could say that the former is more grammatical and the latter more rhetorical.</p>
<p>The first type occurs in the same forms as do faults of language. Indeed, every Figure of this kind would be a fault, if it were accidental and not deliberate. Such a Figure is generally defended by Authority, Antiquity, and Usage, and often also by some logical principle.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_99_5" id="target_note_LCL127_99_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Consequently, although it diverges from the simple direct way of speaking, it is a valuable feature, so long as it has a respectable precedent to follow. It possesses however one great practical use, namely to relieve the tedium of everyday stereotyped language and protect us from a commonplace way of speaking. Used sparingly, and as occasion demands, it will be a sort of condiment, the addition of which will make the speaker more acceptable; but anyone who strains after it too much will sacrifice its special charm of variety. Some Figures, however, are so widely accepted that they have now almost escaped being called Figures; even if these occur quite frequently, they will make less of an impression because our ears have grown accustomed to them. At the same time, recondite Figures, outside common usage, and therefore more conspicuous, stimulate the ear by their novelty, but weary it if used to excess, and reveal that they have not come to the speaker’s mind spontaneously but have been long sought for, dragged out of their various hiding places, and piled together in a heap.</p>
