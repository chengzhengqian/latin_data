claims a part of the estate, the orator claims it all for himself.”</p>
<p>In this, some eloquent persons—those who laugh at us for troubling ourselves unduly with out-of-the-way cases—will seize on the sympathetic personalities: the action is on behalf of an uneducated countryman against an orator, a war hero against a coward, the restorer of his family against an ungrateful brother, a modest man content with a part against one who is reluctant to give up any of his father’s estate to his brother. All these factors are present in the subject, and very helpful they are; but they do not ensure victory. Our friends will look for <span class="italic">sententiae</span> which are, if possible, bold or obscure (for this counts as a virtue nowadays) and the uproar and the clamour will then have brought the theme to a successful conclusion!</p>
<p>Those whose aims are higher, but whose attention is confined to the obvious, will see various points that, as it were, float on the surface of the subject. “The uneducated son is excused for not attending the trial because he could have done his father no good. The orator too has no claim on his father’s gratitude, because the father was convicted. The man who arranged the recall of his father deserves the inheritance. The man who is unwilling to share with a brother, and one moreover who has done such service, is greedy, devoid of family feeling, and ungrateful. Moreover, the first and most important Question is one of Letter and Spirit, and if this is not successfully met, there is no scope for further arguments.”</p>
<p>The man who follows the guidance of nature, on the other hand, will of course reflect that the uneducated son will begin by saying, “My father died intestate leaving us two sons; I claim my share by the law of nations.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_175_24" id="target_note_LCL126_175_24"><sup>24</sup></a> Who is
