some critics: “If an orator has to speak on all subjects, he must be a master of all arts.” I could have answered this in the words of Cicero, in whom I find this passage:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_413_10" id="target_note_LCL124_413_10"><sup>10</sup></a> “In my opinion no one can be an orator praiseworthy in every way, unless he has acquired knowledge of all the important things and arts.” But it is enough for me that the orator should not be ignorant of the subject on which he has to speak. For he does not know all Causes, and yet he ought to be able to speak on all. On which will he speak then? On those about which he has been instructed. Likewise with the arts: he will sometimes learn about those on which he is to speak, and speak of those about which he has learned.</p>
<p>Well, will not a builder speak better about building and a musician better about music? Of course he will, so long as the orator does not know what the problem is. Even an illiterate rural litigant will plead his own Cause better than an orator who does not know what is in dispute. But if he is instructed by the musician or the builder—or for that matter by the litigant—the orator will plead better than the person who instructed him. Nevertheless, the builder (if building is involved) and the musician (if music is involved) will both speak if there is any point which needs confirmation. They will not of course be orators, but they will be acting as orators, just as when a layman bandages a wound he is not a doctor but he is acting as a doctor. Does this sort of thing never arise in Encomia or in Deliberations or in the courts? When the construction of the harbour at Ostia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_413_11" id="target_note_LCL124_413_11"><sup>11</sup></a> was discussed, was it not an orator’s duty to state his view? Yet it needed the technical knowledge of the architect. Does not the orator deal with the question whether discoloration and swelling of the body are signs of poison or of indigestion?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_413_12" id="target_note_LCL124_413_12"><sup>12</sup></a> But this needs medical knowledge.
