discussed in 3.4, the three Aristotelian “kinds of causes”: Forensic (or Judicial), Deliberative, and Epideictic (Lausberg §§ 59–65; Kennedy in <span class="italic">CRHP</span> 44–49). This chapter again is largely doxographical, but Quintilian (3.4.11) accepts the orthodox view, discusses the implications of the Greek terms Epideictic, Encomiastic, and Panegyric, and notes the common ground (justice, expediency, honour) which all three “kinds” share.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 touches briefly on some other traditional distinctions:</p>
<p>5.1. “Content and words”; “nature, art, practice, imitation.”</p>
<p>5.2. The three <span class="italic">officia</span> of “instructing, moving emotions, and giving pleasure.”</p>

<p>5.16. “Absolute” and “Relative” Questions.</p>
<p>Finally (5.17–18) he gives various definitions of a “Cause.”</p>
<p>He has now introduced most of the concepts required for his next subject, which is the very complex Theory of Issues <span class="italic">(status).</span> This is the heart of theoretical forensic rhetoric, and will occupy him both here and in Book Seven. Basic ancient texts include <span class="italic">Ad Herennium</span> 1.18–27, 2.2–26; Cicero, <span class="italic">De inventione</span> 1.10–19, 2.12–end; <span class="italic">Topica</span> 93–96. On the Greek side, the theory (though it had its origins in the sophistic period and, as Quintilian sees, is
