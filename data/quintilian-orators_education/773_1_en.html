<p>However, hiatus is not to be dreaded as a really heinous crime; indeed I am not sure which is worse, carelessness in this respect or obsessive observance. Anxiety about it is certain to inhibit the flow of speech and distract us from more important things. It is no doubt careless to tolerate hiatus indiscriminately, but to be afraid of it everywhere is to make a slave of oneself. There is good reason for the view that all the followers of Isocrates, and Theopompus in particular, took excessive trouble over this. Demosthenes and Cicero, on the other hand, viewed the matter more moderately. For one thing, the coalescence of letters (<span class="italic">synaloephe,</span> as it is called) makes the language run even smoother than if all words kept their full endings; for another, hiatus is sometimes actually appropriate and adds a certain grandeur: in <span class="italic">pulchra oratione acta iacta te,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_181_26" id="target_note_LCL127_181_26"><sup>26</sup></a> the inherently long and rich syllables also take up a certain amount of time in the intervals between the vowels, as though there was a pause there. On this point, the best thing is for me to quote Cicero:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_181_27" id="target_note_LCL127_181_27"><sup>27</sup></a> “This ‘hiatus’ or coming together of vowels has a certain softness in it, a sign of an agreeable carelessness on the part of a man who is more concerned for his matter than for his words.”</p>
<p>(3) Consonants also, and especially the harsher ones, clash violently where words meet, for example a final <span class="sc">s</span> with a following initial <span class="sc">x</span>; the hiss produced by the collision of <span class="sc">s</span> with <span class="sc">s</span> (as in <span class="italic">ars studiorum,</span> “art of studies”) is even more disagreeable. This is why Servius Sulpicius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_181_28" id="target_note_LCL127_181_28"><sup>28</sup></a> dropped the final <span class="sc">s</span> whenever it was followed by another
