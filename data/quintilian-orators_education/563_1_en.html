practically settled the question whether “this” is it. Our object of course is to arrive at a Definition which suits our Cause. Now the most powerful element in a Definition is Quality: is love madness?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_233_28" id="target_note_LCL126_233_28"><sup>28</sup></a> Relevant to this are the Proofs which Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_233_29" id="target_note_LCL126_233_29"><sup>29</sup></a> says are peculiar to Definition, namely those derived from Antecedents, Consequents, Adjuncts, Contraries, Causes, Effects, and the like. I have already dealt with the nature of these arguments.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_233_30" id="target_note_LCL126_233_30"><sup>30</sup></a> Cicero, in <span class="italic">Pro Caecina,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_233_31" id="target_note_LCL126_233_31"><sup>31</sup></a> embraces in a short passage Origins, Causes, Effects, Antecedents, and Consequences: “Why then did they fly?
