every word, clear up ambiguities, unravel perplexities, judge falsehoods, and produce whatever inferences and refutations we wish. We do not however have to use logic in pleadings with the same minute attention to detail as in scholarly debate, because the orator’s duty is not only to instruct but to move and delight the audience, and for this he also needs energy, strength, and grace: the force of a river flowing between high banks with a great sweep of water is greater than that of a shallow stream that bubbles over the pebbles in its path.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_227_6" id="target_note_LCL494_227_6"><sup>6</sup></a> And just as wrestling instructors do not teach their pupils the various “numbers,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_227_7" id="target_note_LCL494_227_7"><sup>7</sup></a> as they are called, in order that the pupils should use them all in the actual fight (for weight and strength and breath count for more), but so that they have a stock of “numbers” from which they can apply one or two, as occasion offers, so likewise this subject of “dialectic” (or “disputation” if we prefer that name)—useful as it often is for definitions, classifications, separation of different things, resolving ambiguities, making distinctions and divisions, laying traps and tying an opponent up in knots—will, if it claims the whole forensic battle for itself, obstruct better qualities, pare down the strength of the speech to match its own limited powers, and destroy it just by its subtle refinements. Thus you can find great experts in disputation, who, once parted from their sophistries, are quite as incompetent in any more serious field as certain little animals that are nimble enough in a confined space but easily caught in the open.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_227_8" id="target_note_LCL494_227_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
