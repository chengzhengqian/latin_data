<p>In oratorical Composition, the more definite and more generally obvious measure should be maintained. It therefore consists of feet, indeed of metrical feet. These are found in oratory so often that we often unwittingly let slip verses of all kinds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_191_47" id="target_note_LCL127_191_47"><sup>47</sup></a> while, on the other hand, there is nothing written in prose which cannot be reduced to some types of verse or cola, if we encounter <span class="italic">grammatici</span> as pedantic as those who forced the poems of certain lyric poets into a variety of measures.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_191_48" id="target_note_LCL127_191_48"><sup>48</sup></a> Cicero indeed often says that the whole business is a matter of Numbers, and he is therefore criticized by some as making prose the slave of Rhythms. (Numbers means Rhythms, as he asserts himself, and he is followed in this by Vergil, when he says “I remember the Numbers, if only I recalled the words,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_191_49" id="target_note_LCL127_191_49"><sup>49</sup></a> and by Horace, in “and moves in Numbers free from law.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_191_50" id="target_note_LCL127_191_50"><sup>50</sup></a>) Among other remarks of Cicero, people attack his saying that “Demosthenes’ thunderbolts would not have struck so hard if they had not been launched upon their way by Numbers.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_191_51" id="target_note_LCL127_191_51"><sup>51</sup></a> Now if here he means “launched by Rhythms,” I disagree. Rhythms, as I said, have no fixed limits or any variety within a given context, but run on to the end with the rise and fall with which they began:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_191_52" id="target_note_LCL127_191_52"><sup>52</sup></a> oratory will not stoop to crack its fingers. Cicero sees this very well and frequently bears witness that he is looking for what is characterized by Number, in the sense that he prefers
