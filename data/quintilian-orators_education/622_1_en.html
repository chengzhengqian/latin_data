<p class="noindent">is made elegant by the coinage of the word <span class="italic">porca</span>; <span class="italic">porco</span> would have lacked dignity. In some cases the reason for the choice is clear. We laughed lately—and quite rightly—at the poet who said</p>
<p>Inside the chest mouse lordlings gnawed the gown,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_351_13" id="target_note_LCL126_351_13"><sup>13</sup></a> while we admire Vergil’s</p>
<p>often the tiny mouse . . .<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_351_14" id="target_note_LCL126_351_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>where the epithet, which is proper and apt, prevented us from expecting too much, the singular number was more appropriate, and the unusual monosyllabic line-ending itself added charm. Horace therefore imitated both features:</p>
<p>there will be born—a funny little mouse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_351_15" id="target_note_LCL126_351_15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The tone does not always have to be raised; it sometimes has to be lowered. Meanness of vocabulary may itself on occasion lend vigour. When Cicero says, in <span class="italic">In Pisonem,</span> “when all your kith and kin are carried on a cart,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_351_16" id="target_note_LCL126_351_16"><sup>16</sup></a> do we think that he has lighted accidentally on the low word, and not deliberately enhanced the contempt felt for the man

It is odd that Q. thinks <span class="italic">porca</span> a word coined by Vergil; it is in fact quite ordinary, used by Cato and Cicero. Q. clearly thought it striking in poetry; <span class="italic">porcus</span> would have had no resonance (indeed, it might have been thought low: see Adams (1982) 82 for an obscene sense of the word). Servius (ad loc.) tells us that the fact is wrong, because it was a male pig that was sacrificed on these occasions; he conjectures that Vergil either “used one gender for another” or showed that the female animal was always the more valuable sacrifice.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL126_351_12').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL126_351_13"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL126_351_13" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">13</sup>A <span class="italic">camillus</span> is a young boy of noble parents who performs some religious duty.
