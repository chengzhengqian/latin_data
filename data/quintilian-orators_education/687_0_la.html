altogether successfully, reconstructed by nineteenth and twentieth-century scholars. Quintilian’s account is to be taken with Cicero, <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 3.173–199 and <span class="italic">Orator</span> 168–238. These texts and others (including Quintilian’s chapter) are annotated and discussed in H. Bornecque, <span class="italic">Les clausules métriques latines,</span> 1907. Quintilian does not always agree with Cicero: for example, he allows Herodotus and Thucydides to have “rhythm,” and he limits the term “foot” (<span class="italic">pes</span>) to units of not more than three syllables. Quintilian evidently knew Dionysius of Halicarnassus’ treatise on the subject (περὶ συνθέσεως ὀνομάτων, <span class="italic">On literary composition,</span> in LCL <span class="italic">Critical Essays</span> 2. 3–245), which is much the best Greek account; he cites it at 9.4.88.</p>

Craik, ed., <span class="italic">Owls to Athens: Essays Presented to Sir Kenneth Dover</span> (1990) 349–362 (reprinted in <span class="italic">Collected Papers in Latin Literature</span> (1995) 312–324).</p>

<p>After pointing out (4.1–2) his general agreement with Cicero, but occasional dissent, Quintilian proceeds (3–15) to explain the importance of the subject (“Longinus” 39–40 should be compared) and to give a brief sketch of its early development in Greece (16–19). He then alludes to some genre distinctions (e.g. philosophy is different from oratory), reminds us of the three basic units of discourse (comma, colon, period), and sets up his tripartite analysis of <span class="italic">compositio</span> into three parts: <span class="italic">ordo</span> (natural, or less natural, order); <span class="italic">iunctura</span> (the “linkage” or “juncture” between individual words, commata, cola, or periods); and finally <span class="italic">numerus</span> (rhythm). He takes these in order: <span class="italic">ordo</span> in 23–32,
