<p>up, then interpret in different words, then make a bolder paraphrase, in which they are allowed to abbreviate and embellish some parts, so long as the poet’s meaning is preserved.

As to Chriae,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_211_6" id="target_note_LCL124_211_6"><sup>6</sup></a> there are several sorts of these: one is akin to Aphorism and rests on a simple statement (“he said” or “he used to say”); another includes an answer (“being asked” or “when this was said to him, he answered”). There is a third type, much the same: “when someone said”—or “did”—“something.” A Chria may also, it is thought, consist only of the subject’s</p>

Neither seems very appropriate; neither “depends on persons.” <span class="italic">Ethologia,</span> read by most editors down to Radermacher, and meaning “description of character” or “speech in character” (like <span class="italic">ēthopoiia</span>) seems on balance to be preferred.
