creditors were just then pressing you hard; you had offended the man whose heir you were, and you knew he would change his will.” Individually, these points are trivial and commonplace, but taken together they are damaging—not like a thunderbolt, maybe, but like a shower of hail.</p>
<p>With some Arguments, the mere statement of them is not enough. They have to be given support. For example, “The motive for the crime was greed” needs an explanation of the force of greed, while to say it was “anger” involves explaining the power such an emotion has over men’s hearts. In this way, the Arguments themselves will be stronger, and also more attractive, since we shall not be displaying the bare skeleton with no flesh on it. It also makes a great difference, if we are relying on an Argument about hatred, whether the hatred was due to envy, injury, or rivalry, whether it was old or recent, and whether it was directed against an inferior, an equal, a superior, a stranger, or a relative. All these involve special methods of treatment, and must be considered with reference to the advantage of our side. On the other hand, we must not always burden the judge with all the Arguments we have discovered, because that both bores him and damages our credibility. A judge cannot believe in the sufficiency of arguments which we, the speakers, do not think adequate.
