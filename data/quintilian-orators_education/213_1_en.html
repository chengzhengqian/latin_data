see the point which the orator must address above all else, even if in pleading his Cause he is to say much more: this must be what he most wants to become clear to the judge. This is the first thing to be considered, but not necessarily the first thing to be said.</p>
<p>Others held that the Issue lies in the first rebuttal made by the defence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_55_9" id="target_note_LCL125_55_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_55_10" id="target_note_LCL125_55_10"><sup>10</sup></a> expresses this view as follows: “that on which the defence first stands when it engages, as it were, to repel attack.” From this arises another question, whether it is always the respondent who creates the Issue. Cornelius Celsus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_55_11" id="target_note_LCL125_55_11"><sup>11</sup></a> particularly objects to this view, saying that the Issue derives not from the repulse of the charge, but from the party who seeks to confirm his initial position: hence, if a defendant denies that a man has been killed, the Issue originates with the accuser, because he will want to prove the fact; whereas if the defendant claims that the man was justifiably killed, the burden of proof is shifted, the Issue comes from the defendant, and the first move is his. I do not agree with this at all. The contrary view is in fact nearer the truth—namely that there is no dispute if the defendant fails to reply, and so the Issue originates with the defendant.</p>
<p>In my view, however, the situation varies, and depends on the circumstances of the Cause, since the initial statement can sometimes seem to produce the Issue, as in Conjectural Causes (because the prosecutor is the main user of Conjecture, which is why some rhetors have called Issues originating with the defendant “Issues of Denial”),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_55_12" id="target_note_LCL125_55_12"><sup>12</sup></a> while in Inferences the whole chain of reasoning comes from the initiator of the case. But as it seems that even in these circumstances it is the party who denies who makes it necessary to pursue these Issues (because if he says “I didn’t do
