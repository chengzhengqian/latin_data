litigant is said to have made a procedural error,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_85_74" id="target_note_LCL125_85_74"><sup>74</sup></a> the Questions which arise are: “Could <span class="italic">he</span> bring the action? Against this man? Under this law? In this court? At this time?” and the like. But (1) Transference in respect of persons, times, legal actions, and so on depends on some particular cause; the Question therefore lies not in the Transference but in the circumstance which causes the Transference. “You ought not to demand the return of the deposit in the praetor’s court, but in the consul’s, because the sum is too large for the praetor’s competence.” The Question here is whether the sum <span class="italic">is</span> too large: so it is a dispute of fact. “You cannot bring an action against me, because you could not have represented the other party.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_85_75" id="target_note_LCL125_85_75"><sup>75</sup></a> The point for decision is whether he could legally have done so. “You should not have proceeded by interdict, but by plea for possession.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_85_76" id="target_note_LCL125_85_76"><sup>76</sup></a> The point in doubt is whether the interdict was correct. All these come under Legal Questions. Do not Demurrers also, in which Transference seems most evident, admit all the different species of argument available under the laws under which the action takes place—Name applicable to the alleged act, Letter and Spirit, Inference? (2) Secondly, the Issue arises out of the Question, and Transference involves no Question on which the orator is arguing, but only that on account of which he is arguing. To put it more plainly, take: “You killed the man,” “I did not.” The Question is whether he killed him, the Issue is Conjecture. Contrast “I have a right to an action,” “You do not.” Here the Question is whether he does have such a right, and the Issue depends on this. For whether he is allowed an action</p>
