<p>The relative importance of witnesses and Arguments has often been discussed. On the one side it is argued that witnesses have knowledge and are bound by their oath, while Arguments are just a matter of mental ingenuity.

<p>Oratory finds a lot of work also in supporting or discrediting other resources of the kind—words spoken in drunkenness, sleep, or madness, or the overheard remarks of little children,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_353_15" id="target_note_LCL125_353_15"><sup>15</sup></a> who will be said by one side never to
