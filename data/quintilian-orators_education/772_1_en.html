<p>That faulty positioning of words can also lead to Ambiguity is common knowledge.</p>
<p>This is, I think, what needed to be said in a brief account of Order. If the Order is faulty, however good and apt the links and cadences, our speech would deserve to be called “ill-composed.”</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Linkage</span></span>
<p>Next follows Linkage. This concerns words, Commata, Cola, and Periods, because all these have good or bad qualities which depend on their combinations.</p>
<p>Let me take them in the natural order. (1) In the first place, there is a feature observed and censured even by the untrained, namely when two consecutive words generate an indecent expression out of the last syllable of the first word and the first of the second.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_179_24" id="target_note_LCL127_179_24"><sup>24</sup></a> (2) Then there is the clash of vowels; when this occurs, the speech gapes (<span class="italic">hiat</span>), pauses, and, as it were, labours.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_179_25" id="target_note_LCL127_179_25"><sup>25</sup></a> The worst sound will be produced by long vowels which produce a clash of the same letters; but the most notable “hiatus” will occur with letters which are pronounced from the back of the mouth or with the mouth open. <span class="sc">e</span> is flatter, <span class="sc">i</span> narrower, and so the fault is less obvious with these. It is less serious to let a short vowel follow a long, and less serious again to have a short vowel preceding a long. The least offence of all is caused by the clash of two short vowels. Again, when the vowels which come together are different, the roughness 〈or smoothness〉 of the combination depends on whether the mouth is differently or similarly shaped in forming them.</p>
