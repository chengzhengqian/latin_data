and spineless, such as the kind we see in many writers (and more and more day by day), that dances to the lascivious tunes of the castanet. Again, no Composition will be so perfect that it ought to go on and on, and always with the same feet. For to lay down one law for all kinds of speech implies a sort of versification; and it is both a sign of obvious affectation (any suspicion of which is particularly to be guarded against) and also leads to boredom and satiety, because it is so monotonous; indeed the prettier it sounds, the more 〈we tire of it〉, and the orator who is caught working hard at this loses both his credibility and all his emotional impact. If a judge thinks the man has time to spare for this, he will neither believe him nor be moved by him to grief or anger. So we should sometimes deliberately unbutton parts of the Composition, as it were, especially those which have cost a great deal of labour, to make sure they do not <span class="italic">seem</span> laboured.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_241_152" id="target_note_LCL127_241_152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p>But let us not be slaves to Composition to the extent of introducing unduly long Hyperbata; we must not be thought to have had no other reason except Composition for doing what we did for Composition’s sake. Certainly let us not alter any apt and appropriate word for the sake of smoothness. After all, no word will prove so intractable that it cannot be found a convenient place; and in avoiding awkward words we seek only to make our Composition more facile, not to make it more beautiful.</p>
<p>I shall not find it surprising however that Latin writers have shown more devotion to Composition than the Attic orators, inasmuch as there is less charm and grace to be had from Latin words. Nor do I think it a fault in Cicero that he has departed somewhat in this area from Demosthenes.
