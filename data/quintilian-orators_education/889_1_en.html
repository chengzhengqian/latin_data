<p>sometimes permissible to show confidence in it. No one could find fault with the following passage: “What am I to think? That I am despised? I see nothing in my life, in my popularity, in my past deeds, in such modest talents as I possess, for Antony to have reason to despise me.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_23_21" id="target_note_LCL494_23_21"><sup>21</sup></a> A little later he puts it more openly: “Did he want to challenge me to a contest of eloquence? That is indeed generous of him. What ampler or richer theme could I find than a defence of myself and an attack on Antony?”</p>
<p>There is arrogance also in those who begin by declaring that they have made up their minds about the Cause, and would not otherwise have undertaken it. Judges are reluctant to listen to a person who usurps their role, and an orator cannot expect from his opponents the respect which Pythagoras got from his pupils—“Himself has spoken.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_23_22" id="target_note_LCL494_23_22"><sup>22</sup></a> But how serious this fault is depends on the personalities of the speakers. It can be justified to a certain extent by age, position, and authority; but hardly anyone is likely to possess these advantages to the point that he no longer needs to temper assertions of this kind with some degree of moderation—as has to be done in all cases in which an advocate bases an argument on himself. What would have been more presumptuous than for Cicero to have said that it was not a crime for a man to be the son of a Roman <span class="italic">eques</span>, when he himself was appearing for the defence?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_23_23" id="target_note_LCL494_23_23"><sup>23</sup></a> But he managed to turn even this to good account, by associating his own rank with that of the judges. “To be the son of a Roman <span class="italic">eques</span> should never have been put forward as a charge by the prosecution before this court, or with me appearing for the defendant.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_23_24" id="target_note_LCL494_23_24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
