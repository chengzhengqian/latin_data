<h2><span class="ac">Introduction</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">This book consists of three separate monographs. The first formally concludes the section on <span class="italic">elocutio</span>, by dealing with the difficult (and almost untranslatable) concept of <span class="italic">decorum</span> (τò πρέπον); the second and third cover the remaining two of the five parts (or “canons”) of Rhetoric, namely Memory and Delivery. Τὸ πρέπον (11.1) was discussed by Aristotle (<span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 3. 1404b4, 1408a10) as a proportionality of language to subject. In this sense, the term, though strictly a desirable quality of <span class="italic">diction</span> (in Theophrastus, one of the four “virtues”), does, as C. O. Brink (<span class="italic">Horace on Poetry: Prolegomena to the Literary Epistles</span>, Cambridge 1963, 229ff.) observes, bring content and expression together (see 11.1.7, where Quintilian recognizes the link with Invention). The concept obviously has an ethical dimension, hardly separable from its aesthetic or rhetorical side; appropriateness to context involves appropriateness to speaker. The best general ancient discussions of this complex idea are Cicero’s: not only <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 1.144, 3.37, 3.210–212 and <span class="italic">Orator</span> 70, 82, but also <span class="italic">De finibus</span> 3.14ff., and especially <span class="italic">De officiis</span> 1.93–99 (with A. R. Dyck ad loc.). M. Pohlenz’ discussion (<span class="italic">Nachrichten der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen</span> 1933, 53–92 = <span class="italic">Kleine Schriften</span> 1. 100–139) remains valuable. Quintilian’s account, in keeping with the moral tendencies of his teaching
