<span class="label"><span class="italic">Grammaticē. (2) Some rules of correct language: Barbarism and Solecism</span></span>
<p class="noindent">Style in general has three virtues: correctness, clarity, and ornament (appropriateness, which is of prime importance, is commonly put under “ornament”),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_123_1" id="target_note_LCL124_123_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the same number of faults, these being the opposites of the virtues. Thus the teacher should next attend to the principles of correct speech, which form the first part of <span class="italic">grammaticē</span>.</p>
<p>These principles apply either to individual words (<span class="italic">verba</span>) or to groups. (I mean <span class="italic">verba</span> to be taken here in a general sense, for the term has two meanings: one in which it covers all the parts of which language is made up, as in Horace’s line “The words (<span class="italic">verba</span>) will follow willingly, once the matter has been provided”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_123_2" id="target_note_LCL124_123_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and another in which it is a particular part of speech: “I read,” “I write.” To avoid this ambiguity, some have preferred to say <span class="italic">voces, locutiones,</span> or <span class="italic">dictiones.</span>) Individual words are (1) either Latin or foreign, (2) either simple or compound, (3) either literal or metaphorical, (4) either in current use or made up.</p>
<p>An individual word contains a fault more often than a virtue. We can say that some word is appropriate, beautiful, or sublime, but none of these qualities belongs to it except in so far as it is part of a complex or context of speech: we praise words when they are well adapted to the matter. The only detectable virtue is “vocality,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_123_3" id="target_note_LCL124_123_3"><sup>3</sup></a> what is called in</p>
