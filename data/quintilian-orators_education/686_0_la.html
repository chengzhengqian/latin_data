rather longer one (102–107) on some obscurer Figures of Thought not mentioned by Cicero, but by Rutilius and others.</p>
<p>9.3, on Figures of Speech, rests on the same sources as 9.2, and parallel material is to be found in the same places. Lausberg (§§ 858–910) handles most of these Figures, using the same categories as Quintilian—i.e. modification of the “natural” expression by means of Addition, Subtraction, Change, or Order; categories which go back at least to Caecilius, and are found (e.g.) in <span class="italic">VPH</span> 28–38 and Phoebammon 3.45.15 Spengel (see note on 9.3.28). Quintilian combines this classification with a comprehensive grouping of all these Figures into two sets, one consisting of innovations of language, and therefore essentially the field of the <span class="italic">grammaticus,</span> and one dependent on word arrangement, which is more the business of the rhetorician (3.1–2). (On this distinction, see D. M. Schenkeveld, <span class="italic">Acta Academiae Hungaricae</span> 40 (2000) 390–397.) The first kind is made up of deliberate oddities, which would be faults if they were not deliberate. Used in reason, and only where appropriate, they lend charm and variety (3–5). The first group of such Figures comprises, <span class="italic">inter alia,</span> apparent breaches of concord in genders or numbers and unusual constructions of various kinds (6–17). Quintilian then proceeds (or so it seems, though the lacuna in 19 obscures this) to classify his “grammatical Figures” according to the four principles of modification: Addition and Subtraction in 18, Change (e.g. comparative for positive, plural for singular or <span class="italic">vice versa</span>) in 19–22, Order (Parenthesis, Hyberbaton) in 23–26. All these give variety. The more “rhetorical” figures, it seems, begin at 28. They are naturally more important. Those which illustrate Addition (28–57) </p></section><notes></notes></section>
