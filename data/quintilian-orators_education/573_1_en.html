the boy on the right track than disown him). In speaking for the sons, both types of case require a humble and suitably apologetic tone. I know this will not be approved by those who like attacking the father by a Figure,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_253_27" id="target_note_LCL126_253_27"><sup>27</sup></a> and I would not venture to say that this may never be done—one may be faced with a theme which demands it—but it is certainly to be avoided when any other procedure is possible. But I shall discuss Figures in another book.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_253_28" id="target_note_LCL126_253_28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>Actions for wrongful treatment<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_253_29" id="target_note_LCL126_253_29"><sup>29</sup></a> resemble those for disowning. They too demand the same moderation in the accusations.</p>

<p>Again, trials about mental incompetence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_253_30" id="target_note_LCL126_253_30"><sup>30</sup></a> are instituted either because of what has happened or of what may or may not happen in the future. In a case resting on past events, the pleader has a free run, so long as he confines himself to denouncing the act, and shows pity personally for a father whose illness has caused this lapse. In the other case, when a change of mind is possible, he must make a long, persuasive plea and only then complain, as a last resort, that it is madness and not a fault of character that stands in the way of reason; and the more he praises the father’s past character, the easier it will be for him to prove that the deterioration is due to the illness. The defendant, whenever the case allows, should be moderate in his defence, because anger and passion are only too much like madness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_253_31" id="target_note_LCL126_253_31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
