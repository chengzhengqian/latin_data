I do not suppose that these are the only merits in the orators of whom I have spoken, but they are the chief ones; nor do I think that the other orators are unimportant. Even Demetrius of Phalerum, who is said to have been the first to set oratory on the downward path,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_295_94" id="target_note_LCL127_295_94"><sup>94</sup></a> I allow to have had a great deal of talent and eloquence; he deserves a mention if only because he is almost the last of the Attic school who can be called an orator.
