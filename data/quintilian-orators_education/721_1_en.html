Emotional appeals also are a great help here, as are hesitations and words interspersed with silences. This will ensure that the judge himself searches for something which perhaps he would not believe if he heard it, and then believes what he thinks he has found out for himself.</p>
<p>However good our Figures, they must not be thick on the ground. Their very frequency makes them transparent and diminishes not their offensiveness but their power to convince, while any failure to make an open attack gives the impression not of modesty, but of lack of confidence. In a word, the judge believes Figures most if he thinks we are reluctant to use them. I have personally had to deal with people like this, and indeed with a situation (though this is rarer) which could not be successfully handled except by this device.
