hand, Marcus Tullius holds that Invention and Disposition are the business of a sensible man, but eloquence belongs to the orator; he therefore put his main effort into instruction for this.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_317_2" id="target_note_LCL126_317_2"><sup>2</sup></a> That he was right in doing this is perfectly obvious just from the name of the thing we are talking about. The word <span class="italic">eloqui</span> means to bring out and communicate to an audience the thoughts you have formed in your mind. Without this, everything that has gone before is useless, like a sword that is put up and will not come out of its scabbard.

I must go on the offensive, and block the way right at the outset to those who would like to use this confession of mine for their own ends: I mean the people who take no trouble with their subject matter (which is the backbone of all Causes) and grow old in a futile pursuit of words. They do this in the name of beauty, which in my view is indeed the finest thing in oratory, but only when it comes naturally, not when it is deliberately sought.
