of Cicero (<span class="italic">Orator</span> 97ff., <span class="italic">Brutus</span> 40). The full treatment of “characters” of style in Demetrius uses <span class="italic">four</span> styles, really two opposing pairs: grand and forceful on the one hand, plain and elegant on the other. Later rhetors, such as Hermogenes, multiply the types, in a way that Quintilian might perhaps approve (see 12.10.66–68; Wooten (1987) expounds Hermogenes; Rutherford (1998) 10–18 gives the background). For a brief account of ancient stylistic theories in general, see Russell (1981) 137–147; Lausberg §§ 1078–1080.</p>
<p>In 12.10.58–65, Quintilian associates the various styles with the three functions of conciliating, informing, and exciting the audience. He also repeats the theory (found in a number of other texts, including Cicero) that Homer can be shown to have known about the three styles, and to have seen that the grand manner exemplified by Odysseus was the highest achievement. But Quintilian is not satisfied with the tripartite scheme; there are many intermediate “notes,” as it were (66–68), and all are necessary in their place for the orator (69–72). What is more important is to be serviceable (72); and this means that indulgence in decadent or meretricious style is a worse mistake than any other (73–76: a fine piece of Quintilianic invective). Finally (77–80) the true orator will command all this range of style with ease; his training will ensure that he does it with judgement, never confusing the good qualities at which he aims with the “adjacent” faults into which lesser men so often fall. The “middle way” is best; both extremes are faulty.</p>
<p>The final chapter (12.11) is not only the conclusion of this book, but an epilogue to the whole work. Its nominal subject is the time and conditions of the orator’s retirement
