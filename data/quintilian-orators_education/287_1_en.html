enough already. It is easier therefore for an advocate to do this than for a litigant, because he can praise without being thought arrogant and can sometimes even criticize to good effect. Sometimes, like Cicero in <span class="italic">Pro Rabirio Postumo,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_203_34" id="target_note_LCL125_203_34"><sup>34</sup></a> he may pretend that he is himself deeply moved, until he finds the way to make the judge listen to him and acquires the authority that comes from sincerity, so that he inspires more confidence either in defending the act or in denying it. So the first thing we shall consider is whether we should use the person of the litigant or an advocate, when both possibilities are available; there is a free choice about this in the schools, but in the forum it is only rarely that a man is a suitable defender of his own Cause. The declaimer, on the other hand, particularly in emotional Causes, should take on the appropriate character, because emotions cannot be delegated, and we cannot give the same force to another’s feelings as to our own.</p>
