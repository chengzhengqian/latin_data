We may compare the situation which arises in Greek from the addition of the letter iota, which they write not only in the ending of datives, but sometimes inside words, as in <span class="sc">ΛΗΙΣΤΗΙ</span> (<span class="italic">lēistēi</span>),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_193_19" id="target_note_LCL124_193_19"><sup>19</sup></a> since etymology demands this letter because of the division of the word into three syllables.</p>
<p>The syllable <span class="italic">ae,</span> which now has <span class="italic">e</span> as second letter, was formerly expressed by <span class="italic">a</span> and <span class="italic">i,</span> by some writers in all circumstances (as in Greek), and by others only in the singular, when they came to the dative or genitive; hence that great lover of antiquity, Vergil, put <span class="italic">pictai vestis</span> and <span class="italic">aquai</span> in his verse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_193_20a" id="target_note_LCL124_193_20a"><sup>20</sup></a> In the same words, <span class="italic">e</span> was usual in the plural: <span class="italic">hi Sullae, Galbae.</span> Lucilius has advice to give about this too; but it occupies several lines, and I must ask the sceptical reader to consult the poet himself, in Book Nine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_193_21" id="target_note_LCL124_193_21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Again, in Cicero’s days and somewhat later, it was the general practice to write <span class="italic">s</span> double when it occurred between two long vowels or after a long vowel, as in <span class="italic">caussae, cassus, divissiones.</span> That Cicero himself and Vergil both used this spelling is shown by their autographs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_193_22" id="target_note_LCL124_193_22"><sup>22</sup></a> And yet somewhat earlier writers spelt <span class="italic">iussi,</span> in which we have the double <span class="italic">s,</span> with one <span class="italic">s.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_193_23" id="target_note_LCL124_193_23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
