grand defence: “Quintus Varius of Sucro alleges that Aemilius Scaurus has betrayed the common interests of the Roman people; Aemilius Scaurus denies it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_461_3" id="target_note_LCL125_461_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Iphicrates is said to have done something like this: he asked Aristophon, who was prosecuting him on a similar charge, whether he would have betrayed his country for a bribe and, when Aristophon said “No,” he went on to say “So have I done what you would not have done?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_461_4a" id="target_note_LCL125_461_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> However, we must think also about the judge before whom we are appearing, and look for such Arguments as will most appeal to him. I spoke of this in giving my rules for the Prooemium and for Deliberative speeches.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_461_5" id="target_note_LCL125_461_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Another type of emotional Proof is by strong asseveration: “<span class="italic">I</span> did this!” “<span class="italic">You</span> told <span class="italic">me</span> this!” “The outrageous crime!” and the like. Such things ought not to be lacking in a speech; the absence of them is damaging. Nevertheless, they are not to be regarded as major sources of support, because this sort of thing can be done in like manner on both sides in the same Cause.</p>
<p>More reliable are Proofs which are based on individual character and supported by a plausible reason: for example, a wounded man or one who has lost a son is not likely to accuse anyone who is not guilty, since, if he stirs things up against the innocent, he frees the real culprit from risk of punishment. This is an Argument from which fathers seek support against their sons, or relatives against relatives.</p>
