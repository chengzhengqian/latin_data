says, making a mosaic, and fitting his words together “in vermiculate work.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_225_128" id="target_note_LCL127_225_128"><sup>128</sup></a> Will not his passion cool and his energy flag, just as showy riders spoil the free movement of their horses by forcing them to a mincing gait? As if it was 〈they who had created the Rhythms, instead of the Rhythms〉 being discovered in the process of Composition! So with poetry: everyone agrees that it came originally from the outpourings of inspiration, and was generated by the ear’s sense of measure and the observation of regularly recurring intervals, the feet contained in it being a later discovery. It follows that regular practice in writing will train us well enough for this, to the point of being able to extemporize a flow of rhythmical prose. It is not the individual feet we have to watch so much as the general shape, just as verse writers keep their eye on the whole movement of the verse, not on the five or six parts of which it is made up. Poetry arose before its rules were known: that is what lies behind “the Fauns and prophets sang.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_225_129a" id="target_note_LCL127_225_129a"><sup>129</sup></a> Composition plays the same part in oratory as Versification in poetry.</p>
<p>The best judge of Composition is the ear, which senses completeness, feels the lack when something is incomplete, is offended by unevenness, soothed by smoothness, and excited by speed; it approves stability, detects lameness, and is bored by redundancy and excess. The learned therefore know the principles of Composition, but even the unlearned know its pleasures.</p>
