<p>Since we have now inadvertently arrived at the more difficult kind of Narratives, let us now speak of those in which the facts are against us. Some have held that, in this case, the Narrative should be omitted. Nothing is easier—except of course not taking the Cause on at all! But if you do take on a case of this kind for some good reason, what sort of art is it that admits the weakness of a Cause by silence? Or is the judge going to be stupid enough to give judgement in line with something which he knows you did not want to put before him? (I do not of course deny that, just as there may be some points in a Narrative to be denied, some to be added, and some to be altered, so also there may be some to be passed over in silence—but only those which it is right to pass over, where there is freedom to do so. This occurs sometimes for the sake of brevity, as in the sentence “He answered as he thought fit.”)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_253_47" id="target_note_LCL125_253_47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Let us then distinguish the different types of Cause. (1) In those in which the question is not one of guilt but of legal procedure we can make a confession, even if the set theme of the declamation is against us: “He took money from the temple, but it was private money, and so he is not guilty of sacrilege”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_253_48" id="target_note_LCL125_253_48"><sup>48</sup></a> “He raped the virgin, but it is not her father who is given the choice”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_253_49" id="target_note_LCL125_253_49"><sup>49</sup></a> “He seduced a free-born boy and the victim hanged himself, but the seducer is not liable to capital punishment as having caused the death, but to a fine of 10,000 sesterces, the penalty laid down for a seducer.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_253_50" id="target_note_LCL125_253_50"><sup>50</sup></a> However, even in these confessions there can be some mitigation of the odium produced by our opponent’s Narrative. After all, even our slaves try to extenuate
