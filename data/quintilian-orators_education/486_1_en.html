orator. Totally foreign to his personality also is the rough humour of the buffoon or the stage. As for obscenity, it should not only be banished from his language, but should not even be hinted at. If there is ever ground for making a charge of obscene behaviour, this is a reproach not to be made in the form of a joke. Again, while I want my orator to speak “urbanely,” I do not at all want him to seem to be striving for this. He will therefore not make witty remarks whenever he can, and will sacrifice a jest rather than diminish his authority. No one will tolerate a prosecutor who makes jokes in a horrendous case, or a defence advocate who does so in one that commands pity. Some judges also are too serious to be willing to allow laughter.</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that something said against an opponent applies to the judge or also to our own client; yet one finds people who do not even avoid jests which can recoil upon themselves. Sulpicius Longus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_79_26" id="target_note_LCL126_79_26"><sup>26</sup></a> who was a hideous man, once said that his opponent, in a case concerning his status as a free man, “did not so much as have the face of a free man”; Domitius Afer’s reply was “Then, Longus, in your judgement, is a man who has an ugly face not a free man?”</p>
<p>Also to be avoided is any sign of insolence or arrogance in our words, any inappropriateness of time or place, any hint of premeditation or of the ready-made speech. As for attacking the unfortunate, any joke is cruel, as I said; but there are also some people of such established authority and acknowledged respectability that any aggressive language used against them will do the speaker harm. As to friends, I have already given advice.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_79_27" id="target_note_LCL126_79_27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>My next suggestion is relevant not so much to an orator as to any human being: if you provoke someone whom it is
