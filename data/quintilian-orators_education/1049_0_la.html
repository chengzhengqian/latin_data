<p>(1) <span class="italic">Spalding, followed in principle by most later editors, proposed</span>: qui habitu tardiorem firmioremque memoriam fieri 〈videam〉, artem quoque audeam impertire, <span class="italic">‘seeing as I do that memory becomes slower and more retentive because of habit, I shall not be so credulous as to venture to assign an art also to it.’ This hardly makes sense of ‘I shall not be so credulous,’ and contradicts the statement in §9 that art does make a contribution to memory.</span></p>
<p>(2) <span class="italic">Q. appears to have in mind Cicero, Tusc. Disp.</span> 1.57–61, <span class="italic">where Cicero criticizes both the anamnesis theory of Plato’s Meno, and the common ‘wax tablet’ model of memory. Q’s</span> inprimi . . . animo <span class="italic">echoes Cic.</span> 61, <span class="italic">and</span> magis admirari naturam subit <span class="italic">recalls Cic.</span> 59, <span class="italic">where the anamnesis theory is dismissed. Compare also the refutation of the anamnesis idea in Tertullian, De anima</span> 24.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="italic">Assuming that Q.’s ‘disbelief’ is likely to apply to the very controversial anamnesis theory, D.A.R. suggests, e.g.,</span> neque ero tam credulus ut, cum sciam habitu tardiorem firmioremque memoriam fieri, ante quoque 〈nos natos putem〉 ad animum pervenire, <span class="italic">‘I shall not be so credulous, when I know that memory becomes slower or firmer as a result of habit, as to think that it arrives in the mind even before we are born.’</span></p>
<p>(4) <span class="italic">Assuming that the waxtablet model is still being criticized, M.W. suggests, e.g.,</span> neque ero tam credulus ut putem attritu tardiorem infirmioremque memoriam fieri et tactum quoque (<span class="italic">cf.</span> 11.3.14) ad animum penetrare, <span class="italic">‘I shall not be so credulous as to believe that memory becomes slower and less secure by being worn away, and that touch also penetrates to the mind.’</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">But all reconstructions are very speculative.</span></p>
