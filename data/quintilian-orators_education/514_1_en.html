with a student of the same attainments in choosing a subject, a real or even an imaginary case, and then taking the two sides as in an Altercation. The same thing can also be done with simple Questions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_135_4" id="target_note_LCL126_135_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I want the advocate to understand also in what order his Proof should be presented to the judge. The principle here is the same which applies in Arguments: the strongest should be placed first and last, because the first prepare the judge to believe us, and the last prepare him to pronounce in our favour.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_135_5" id="target_note_LCL126_135_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Having dealt with these matters to the best of my ability, I should have had no hesitation about proceeding at once to Disposition, which comes next in order, were I not afraid that, as some scholars have included Judgement under Invention, I might be thought by some to have left this out. My own view is that it is so inextricably involved in every part of our work that it cannot be separated from the study of individual thoughts and even single words; and it can no more be taught by art than taste or a sense of smell. All I can do, therefore, now and in what follows, is to show what should be pursued or avoided in particular cases, so that Judgement may be guided accordingly. Am I to recommend not attempting the impossible, avoiding anything that runs counter to our Cause or can equally well be used on the other side, and ensuring that there is nothing decadent or obscure in the style? All this has to be referred to the senses, and they cannot be taught.</p>
