(4) Substitution (one word put instead of another) is not controversial. It is found in all parts of speech, but more often in verbs, because these have most variety of form, so that we get Solecisms of voice, tense, person, mood (or “state” or “quality,” if you prefer, whether there are six of these or, as some say, eight:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_145_47" id="target_note_LCL124_145_47"><sup>47</sup></a> there will be as many types of fault as there are subdivisions of the various things we have mentioned), and finally number, in which we have only singular and plural whereas the Greeks have also the dual.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_145_48" id="target_note_LCL124_145_48"><sup>48</sup></a> Some have given us a dual also, in <span class="italic">scripsere</span> (“they wrote”) and <span class="italic">legere</span> (“they read”): but this is just a softened form to avoid some harshness, like <span class="italic">male merere</span> (“you deserve ill”) for <span class="italic">male mereris</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_145_49" id="target_note_LCL124_145_49"><sup>49</sup></a> in old writers.
