inferred from another, and which confirms what is doubtful by means of what is not doubtful, there must be something in the Cause which does not need Proof; for unless there is something which either is or seems to be true, and from which assurance may be given to what is doubtful, there will be nothing by which we can prove anything.</p>
<p>Now we regard as certain (1) things perceived by the senses, for example what we see or hear (Signs come under this head); (2) things about which common opinion is unanimous: the existence of the gods, the duty of respecting parents; (3) provisions of laws; (4) what has been accepted as moral custom, if not in the belief of all mankind, at least in that of the city or nation where the case is being pleaded—many matters of right, for example, involve custom rather than laws; (5) whatever is agreed between both parties; (6) whatever has been proved; (7) lastly, whatever is not contradicted by our opponent.

<p>Probabilities are of three kinds: (1) the strongest, because almost always true, for example that children are loved by their parents; (2) the highly likely, for example that a man in good health will survive till tomorrow; (3) the merely compatible, for example that a theft in a house was
