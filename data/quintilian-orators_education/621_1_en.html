<p>It is of course a perfectly correct rule that Lucidity has more need of “proper” words, and Ornament of metaphors; but let us be clear that nothing “improper” is “ornamental.” However, as it often happens that several words share the same meaning (this is called “synonymy”), it follows that some are more dignified, lofty, smart, pleasing, or euphonious than others. For just as syllables composed of the better-sounding letters have a clearer ring, so words composed of such syllables are more euphonious, and the fuller the sound of a given word, the more attractive it is to the ear.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_349_10" id="target_note_LCL126_349_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Combinations of words act just like combinations of syllables; some combinations sound better than others. The practical use of them, however, is different, because when the content is outrageous, words which are also harsh to the ear will be more appropriate than others. As a general rule, though, the best individual words are held to be those which have the fullest or the most pleasing sound.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_349_11" id="target_note_LCL126_349_11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Respectable words are always preferable to coarse; for really low words there is no place in educated speech.</p>
<p>Striking and sublime words normally need to be judged against the level of the subject. What seems grand in one context seems inflated in another, what is too low-key for an important theme seems apt for a lesser one. And just as a low word is conspicuous in a highly polished context, and shows up on it like a dirty mark, so a lofty or brilliant word is out of keeping with a simple style, and becomes a decadent feature, a swelling on a level surface.</p>
<p>Some phrases are judged by the ear rather than by reason: the line</p>
