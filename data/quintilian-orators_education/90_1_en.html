not conceived a dislike for regular study, and so I must not make the mistake of casting doubt on my case by too anxious a defence. It will, I believe, be already clear from the examples I have adduced what music I approve of, and to what extent. Nevertheless, I think I ought to state more plainly that I do <span class="italic">not</span> recommend the effeminate music of the modern stage, emasculated by indecent rhythms, which has done so much to destroy any manly strength we still had left, but rather the music to which the praises of brave men were sung, and which brave men themselves used to sing.
