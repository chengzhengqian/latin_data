is something parents like), and a repeated insistence on adapting teaching to individual needs. Pupils too have their obligations. Finally (2.10), Quintilian takes a position on declamation: it should be as realistic as possible, so as to give the pupil an idea of what he will encounter in real life. The structure of 2.1–10 is analysed in detail by R. Granatelli, <span class="italic">Rhetorica</span> 13 (1995) 137–160.</p>
<p class="noindent">(b) Quintilian begins the second part of the book (2.11–12) by defending “Art” against those who think Nature can do everything. Though this is a commonplace prefatory topic (e.g. “Longinus” 2.1), he sounds as if he has a particular target in mind, persons who win cheap success by an intemperate and violent manner. It is not that Art can do everything (2.13); the circumstances of Causes demand a great variety of approaches, to be judged not by textbook rules but by the two general criteria of “the expedient” and “the becoming” (2.13.8).</p>
<p>After briefly discussing (2.14) the name “rhetoric” and possible Latin equivalents, and its division into “art, artist, work”—a division which he makes use of in the general scheme of his own work (12.10; Lausberg §§ 42–45; General Introduction)—Quintilian moves on (2.15) to a doxographical account of definitions of rhetoric. He comes down firmly on the side of those which include a moral element, and do not speak simply of an “art of persuasion.” He goes back to Plato (2.14.24–30), whom he defends against what he regards as inadequate interpretations.
