an emotion which makes us ashamed to do the right thing? On the other hand, I am quite happy that a speaker should feel anxious when he rises, change colour, and be aware of the risks he runs; indeed, if these symptoms did not occur, we should actually have had to simulate them. But this should be a proper awareness of the task ahead, not fear of it; let us be troubled, but not break down. The best remedy for shyness is self-confidence; however fragile our assurance, it is supported by the consciousness of our own worth.</p>
<p>There are also, as I said above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_249_3" id="target_note_LCL494_249_3"><sup>3</sup></a> natural tools, which are nevertheless capable of being improved by care: voice, lungs, good looks. These are so important that they often give rise to a reputation for talent. Our generation has had more fluent orators than Trachalus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_249_4" id="target_note_LCL494_249_4"><sup>4</sup></a> but when he was speaking, he seemed to tower above his contemporaries. This was the effect of his height, the fire of his eye, the authority of his bearing, the impressiveness of his gestures, and the voice that was not “almost a tragic actor’s” (as Cicero recommends)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_249_5" id="target_note_LCL494_249_5"><sup>5</sup></a> but better than any tragic actor I ever heard. I well remember, when he was speaking in the Basilica Julia before Tribunal One,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_249_6" id="target_note_LCL494_249_6"><sup>6</sup></a> and (as is customary) four juries were being empanelled and there was total uproar everywhere, he could nevertheless be heard and understood and (a thing particularly galling to the other pleaders) actually applauded in all four Tribunals. Here we have something to pray for, and a rare blessing; if it is not vouchsafed him, a speaker should be content to be heard by those he is addressing!</p>
<p>This is the kind of person the orator should be, and these are the things which he should know.</p>
