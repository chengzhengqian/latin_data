<p>As I have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_363_4" id="target_note_LCL125_363_4"><sup>4</sup></a> we translate <span class="italic">sēmeion</span> as <span class="italic">signum</span>—though some have used <span class="italic">indicium</span> (“indication”) or <span class="italic">vestigium</span> (“trace”) instead.
