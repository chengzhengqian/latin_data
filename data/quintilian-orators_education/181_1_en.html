saying it has no material peculiar to itself is that it possesses a multifarious material. But “multifarious” material is not necessarily “unlimited”; various minor arts have multifarious materials—architecture, for example, which operates with everything useful for building, or engraving which uses gold, silver, bronze, and iron to produce its work. Carving indeed covers wood, ivory, marble, glass, and jewels, as well as what I have just mentioned. Again, if someone else is also concerned with a particular material, it does not follow that it is not a material of rhetoric. For if I ask what the sculptor’s material is, I shall be told bronze; and if I ask what is the material of the smith (I mean the craft which the Greeks call <span class="italic">chalkeutikē</span>), the answer will likewise be bronze. But there is a lot of difference between statues and bowls. Nor will medicine cease to be an art because it shares the use of unguents and exercise with gymnastics, and diet even with cookery.</p>

And finally, as the material of dialectic is the discussion of everything submitted to it, and dialectic is an abbreviated form of rhetoric, why should not continuous speech also have the same material?</p>
