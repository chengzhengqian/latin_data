on the ground that it is his business to invent, dispose, put into words, and so on. But if we accept this view, we shall leave nothing to the art. To speak well is indeed the orator’s business, but the science of speaking well will still be rhetoric; or, as others hold, it is the artist’s business to persuade, but the power of persuasion belongs to the art. Thus it is the orator’s business to “invent” and “dispose,” but Invention and Disposition belong properly to rhetoric.</p>
<p>There has been much difference of opinion as to whether these are parts or works of rhetoric, or, as Athenaeus thinks, its “elements,” which the Greeks call <span class="italic">stoicheia.</span> However, one cannot rightly call them “elements,” or they will simply be the basic principles, as water, fire, matter, or atoms are of the universe. Nor can they well be called “works,” because they are not produced by others, but themselves produce something else. So they can only be “parts.” For since rhetoric is composed of them, and since a whole consists of parts, the things of which the whole is composed cannnot help being parts of it. Those who have called them “works” seem to me to have been influenced by their desire not to use the same name again in another classification of the subject; for they said that Encomium, Deliberative Oratory, and Forensic Oratory were “parts” of rhetoric. But if these are parts, they are parts of the material rather than of the art. For rhetoric is present as a whole in each of these, because each of them requires Invention, Disposition, Elocution, Memory, and Delivery. Some have therefore chosen to speak of three “kinds” of rhetoric; but the best solution is that of those whom Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_29_10" id="target_note_LCL125_29_10"><sup>10</sup></a> follows, to call them “kinds of Causes.”</p>
