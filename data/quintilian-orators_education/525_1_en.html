stage, where the conflict may be found. “They were not committing adultery”: “They were.” This is a dispute about fact: it is a Conjecture. Sometimes even this third stage, that they were adulterers, is agreed. “But it was not lawful for you to kill them,” says the prosecution, “because you were an exile” or “had lost your citizen’s rights.” Now it is a question of Law. On the other hand, if, when the one side says “You killed,” the answer is “I did not,” the conflict arises straight away.</p>
<p>If we have to dig deeper in order to find where the controversy begins, it becomes necessary to consider what &lt;the charge is which&gt; produces the first Question. Simple charge: “Rabirius killed Saturninus.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_157_4" id="target_note_LCL126_157_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Complex: “Lucius Varenus has committed an offence under the law of murder, because he arranged for Gaius Varenus to be killed, Gnaeus Varenus to be wounded, and Salarius also to be killed.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_157_5" id="target_note_LCL126_157_5"><sup>5</sup></a> In this case there will be distinct propositions (and let us take it that this applies also in civil suits). In a complex charge, however, there may be a number of Questions and Issues, if the defendant denies one fact, seeks to justify another, and seeks to show that a third is not actionable.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_157_6" id="target_note_LCL126_157_6"><sup>6</sup></a> In these cases, the pleader will have to discover what he should refute in each place.</p>
<p>As regards the prosecutor, I am in general agreement with Celsus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_157_7" id="target_note_LCL126_157_7"><sup>7</sup></a> who (doubtless following Cicero) nevertheless insists somewhat too vehemently on the principle that a strong point should be put at the beginning, the strongest of all at the end, and the weaker points in between, on the ground that the judge has to be moved at the beginning
