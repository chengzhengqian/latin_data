between the worlds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_221_8" id="target_note_LCL126_221_8"><sup>8</sup></a> Both use the same word; both use Conjecture to determine which concept fits the facts. Sometimes (2) it is a question of Quality: “What is Rhetoric? Is it the power of persuasion or the science of speaking well?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_221_9" id="target_note_LCL126_221_9"><sup>9</sup></a> This kind of thing is very common in the courts. This is the way in which one asks whether the man caught with another man’s wife in a brothel is an adulterer. Here there is no doubt about the name, but only about the significance of the act: was it in any sense wrongdoing? If it was, he can only be an adulterer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_221_10" id="target_note_LCL126_221_10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>There is a totally different type of Question in which the dispute rests on a word which depends on a written text. This appears in judicial proceedings only because of words which give rise to a legal conflict: is a suicide a homicide? Is the man who drives a tyrant to death a tyrannicide? Do magic spells amount to poisoning?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_221_11a" id="target_note_LCL126_221_11a"><sup>11</sup></a> The facts here are clear, and it is understood that killing oneself is not the same as killing someone else, killing a tyrant is not the same as driving him to death, and spells are a different thing from a lethal potion; but the question is whether they should be called by the same name.</p>
<p>Although I hardly dare to differ from Cicero,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_221_12" id="target_note_LCL126_221_12"><sup>12</sup></a> who follows many authorities in saying that Definition is a matter of Same and Other (since if you deny the applicability of a word, you always have to propose a better one), I myself hold that there are three species, as it were, of Definition.</p>
