<p>But let us take uses in war to be none of our business, and pass over the fact that Archimedes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_237_47" id="target_note_LCL124_237_47"><sup>47</sup></a> on his own, prolonged the siege of Syracuse. What is important for our purpose is that many problems, which are difficult to solve in other ways, are often solved by these “linear proofs,” such as the method of division, infinite section, and speed of increase.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_237_48a" id="target_note_LCL124_237_48a"><sup>48</sup></a> So, if (as the next book will prove)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_237_49" id="target_note_LCL124_237_49"><sup>49</sup></a> an orator has to speak on all subjects, he cannot be an orator without geometry.</p>

<p class="noindent">The comic actor too should be given some part, but only in so far as the future orator needs a knowledge of Delivery. I do not want the boy we are educating for this purpose to have a weak and womanish voice or to quaver like an old man. Nor ought he to mimic the failings of drunkenness, be taught the cringing manners of a slave, or learn the emotions of love, greed, or fear. These things are not necessary for an orator, and they infect the mind, especially in the early years when it is malleable and unformed. Frequent imitation develops into habit.
