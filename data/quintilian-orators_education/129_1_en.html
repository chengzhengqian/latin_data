<p>The teacher will not only be required to give instruction on these things himself, but to ask frequent questions and test his pupils’ judgement. This will get rid of inattentiveness while they are listening, and ensure that what is said does not go in at one ear and out at the other; at the same time they will be led to form their own ideas and to understand, which is the object of the exercise. After all, what else do we aim at by teaching them except to ensure that they do not always need to be taught?</p>
<p>I would venture to say that this kind of effort will contribute more to learners than all the textbooks of all the writers on rhetoric; these are no doubt a great help, but how can they possibly so extend their range as to go through all the specific cases that arise almost every day? War is like this. Although some general principles are traditionally taught, it will be more useful to know the methods employed, whether wisely or not, by particular generals in various circumstances, times, and places. Precept is less important than experience in almost every field. If the teacher declaims to provide his pupils with models, would not reading Cicero and Demosthenes make a bigger contribution? If the pupil is corrected in public when he makes a mistake in declaiming, would it not be more effective, and indeed pleasanter, to correct an existing speech? Everyone prefers to hear the faults of others criticized rather than his own.</p>
<p>There is more that I could say. But the practical value of this method escapes no one. I only wish the reluctance that is felt about it was not as great as the satisfaction it is sure to give!</p>
