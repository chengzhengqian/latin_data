one meeting for pleasure, one to receive advice, and one to judge Causes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_33_5" id="target_note_LCL125_33_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Thinking it all through, another principle also occurs to me, namely that the whole task of oratory must be either in court or not in court. The “kind” of the questions which arise in court is obvious; those which do not come before a judge must relate either to the past or to the future. We praise and denounce the past, we deliberate about the future. Again, everything on which we have to speak must be either certain or uncertain. We praise or blame what is certain, according to our individual inclinations; as to the uncertain, it is either a matter of our own free choice, and this is a subject for deliberation, or else it is something left to others to decide, and then it forms the subject of litigation.</p>
<p>Anaximenes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_33_6a" id="target_note_LCL125_33_6a"><sup>6</sup></a> took forensic and “demegoric” oratory as the two general types, but held that there were seven species: Exhortation, Dissuasion, Praise, Denunciation, Prosecution, Defence, Inquiry (which he called “exetastic”). But the first two of these are parts of the deliberative class, the next two of Epideictic, and the last three of forensic oratory.</p>

That treatise begins (1421b 8–11): τρία γένη τῶν πoλιτικῶν εἰσὶ λóγων, τò μἐν δημηγoρικóν, τò δὲ ἐπιδεικτικóν, τò δὲ δικανικόν· είδη δὲ τoύτων ἑπτά· προτρεπτικόν, ἀπoτρεπτικóν, ἐγκωμιαστικóν, ψεκτικóν, κατηγoρικóν, ἀπoλoγικòν καὶ ἐξεταστικóν: “There are three types of oratorical speech, Demegoric, Epideictic, and Dicanic (i.e. “judicial”); of these, there are seven species: protreptic, apotreptic, encomiastic, invective, accusatory, defensive, and examinatory.” The seven species correspond with Q.’s list (as was observed by P. Victorius in the sixteenth century). Spengel and others have held that the text has been tampered with to fit Aristotle’s system of three “types”; they would change τρία (three) to δύο (two), and delete τὸ ἐπιδεικτικόν (Epideictic). For discussion, see V. Buchheit, <span class="italic">Das Genos Epideiktikon</span> (1960) 191–197; see also Kennedy, <span class="italic">AP</span> 114–124. B’s omission of <span class="italic">et</span> in our passage (see text note) raises the possibility (also seen by Victorius) that Q. gave <span class="italic">three</span> “general species,” a list in asyndeton: we would then have to supply <span class="italic">laudativam</span> or <span class="italic">demonstrativam</span> as the third.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL125_33_6a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
