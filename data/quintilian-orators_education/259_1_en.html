<p>Aristotle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_147_53" id="target_note_LCL125_147_53"><sup>53</sup></a> held that Epideictic was the most suitable type for writing, and that Forensic came next, presumably because the former was wholly concerned with display, and the latter needed art, to the point even of deceiving the audience if this was what expediency demanded, while Deliberative was based on trust and prudence. I agree with this so far as Epideictic is concerned (indeed all other writers say the same); but I think that methods of speaking in forensic and deliberative oratory must depend on the conditions of the subject which is to be treated.

<p>Almost everyone rightly agrees that the use of examples is particularly appropriate to this kind of speech, because the future often seems to reflect the past, and experience can be regarded as evidence supporting theoretical reasoning.</p>
<p>Brevity and greater fullness are determined not by the nature but by the scope of the subject. The Question is generally more straightforward in deliberative, just as it is often of lesser compass in forensic cases.</p>
<p>That all this is true will be plain to anyone who chooses to read not only speeches but history (where the speeches in assemblies and councils commonly fulfil the functions of persuasion and dissuasion), rather than letting himself grow old poring over rhetoricians’ textbooks. He will often
