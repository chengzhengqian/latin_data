want Paraphrase to be a mere passive reproduction, but to rival and vie with the original in expressing the same thoughts. I therefore disagree with those who forbid paraphrases of Latin speeches, on the ground that all the best expressions have been anticipated and anything we put in another way is bound to be worse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_359_8" id="target_note_LCL127_359_8"><sup>8</sup></a> In fact we do not always need to despair of being able to find something better than the original, nor did nature make eloquence such a poor, starved thing that any given subject can only be well handled once!
