<p>think this is only verbal correctness (“orthoepy”); and I am certainly not against this! For what is so necessary as correct speech? Indeed, my rule is that one should stick to this principle as far as possible, and keep up resistance against innovators even for a long time; but to maintain obsolete and extinct forms is a sign of a certain presumption and petty ostentation in matters of small importance. The man of learning who says the usual word of greeting <span class="italic">without</span> an aspirate and <span class="italic">with</span> a long second syllable (it is long in <span class="italic">avēte</span>), and says <span class="italic">calefacere</span> instead of what we all say, and likewise <span class="italic">conservavisse,</span> might as well add <span class="italic">face</span> and <span class="italic">dice</span> and the like.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_171_22" id="target_note_LCL124_171_22"><sup>22</sup></a> His road is the right one, of course; but there is an easier and more frequented one at hand.</p>
<p>There is, however, nothing which annoys me more in these people than their allowing themselves not only to discover but actually to change nominative forms on the basis of the other cases: thus in <span class="italic">ebur</span> (“ivory”) and <span class="italic">robur</span> (“strength”), which the highest authorities pronounce and write like that, they change the vowel of the second syllable to <span class="italic">o,</span> on the ground that we have <span class="italic">roboris</span> and <span class="italic">eboris,</span> while <span class="italic">sulpur</span> and <span class="italic">guttur</span> keep <span class="italic">u</span> in the genitive. <span class="italic">Iecur</span> and <span class="italic">femur</span> therefore also have given rise to controversy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_171_23" id="target_note_LCL124_171_23"><sup>23</sup></a> This is no less arbitrary than if they were to foist an <span class="italic">o</span> on <span class="italic">sulpur</span> (“sulphur”) and <span class="italic">guttur</span> (“throat”) in the genitive, because there is one in <span class="italic">eboris</span> and <span class="italic">roboris.</span> Thus Antonius Gnipho,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_171_24" id="target_note_LCL124_171_24"><sup>24</sup></a> who allows <span class="italic">robur</span> and <span class="italic">ebur</span> and even <span class="italic">marmur</span> (“marble”) to be correct, wants the plurals to be <span class="italic">ebura, robura,</span></p>
