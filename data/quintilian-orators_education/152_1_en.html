He, though far from sharing the aims of those who disparage the duties of an orator, defines the art somewhat carelessly, saying “rhetoric is the craftsman (<span class="italic">dē</span><span class="italic">miourgos</span>) of persuasion (<span class="italic">peithō</span>).” (I cannot bring myself to use the new coinage with which Ennius described Marcus Cethegus as <span class="italic">suadae medulla,</span> “marrow of persuasion.”)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_353_3" id="target_note_LCL124_353_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Gorgias, in the dialogue of Plato which takes its name from him, says much the same; but Plato wants it to be seen as Gorgias’ view, not his own.
