to oratory, would serve humanity very badly, if what I am doing is to provide these arms not for the soldier, but for the brigand. But why speak of myself? Nature herself, in that very respect in which she seems to have specially favoured the human race and marked us off from all other animals,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_199_2" id="target_note_LCL494_199_2"><sup>2</sup></a> will have proved not a mother to us but a stepmother<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_199_3" id="target_note_LCL494_199_3"><sup>3</sup></a> if she devised the faculty of speech to be the accomplice of crime, the opponent of innocence, and the enemy of truth. It would have been better for us to be born dumb and devoid of reason than to pervert the gifts of providence for our mutual destruction.</p>
<p>But this view of mine has further implications. I am not only saying that the orator must be a good man, but that <span class="italic">no one</span> can be an orator <span class="italic">unless</span> he is a good man.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_199_4" id="target_note_LCL494_199_4"><sup>4</sup></a> One could surely not concede intelligence to people who are offered the paths of virtue and of vice and then choose the worse—nor indeed prudence either, because, owing to the uncertain outcome of events, they often become exposed by their own doing to the heaviest penalties of the law, and <span class="italic">always</span> to those of a bad conscience. If it is not only a philosophers’ saying, but has always been a common belief, that “no one is bad unless he is also a fool,” it will surely be true that a fool will never be an orator.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_199_5" id="target_note_LCL494_199_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Moreover, the mind is never at liberty even to study this noble art unless it is free of all vices: first, because virtue and vice cannot coexist</p>
