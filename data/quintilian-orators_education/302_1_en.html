These have to be disposed of first, so that the judge can give a friendly hearing to the defence of the matter which is actually in question. For example, if Marcus Caelius had to be defended, would it not be best for his advocate to meet first the accusations of luxury, wantonness, immorality, and poisoning—which form the whole subject of Cicero’s speech—and only then proceed to narrate the story of the property of Palla and develop the whole question of violence, which has been defended in Caelius’ own speech?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_233_24" id="target_note_LCL125_233_24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
