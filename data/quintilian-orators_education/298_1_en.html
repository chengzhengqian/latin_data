matters relevant to the Cause. “I did not kill the man”: no Narrative here. Agreed; but there will be <span class="italic">some</span> Narrative, and sometimes even a long one, to counter prosecution arguments, to present the defendant’s past life, to explain the reasons which have brought an innocent man into jeopardy, and to advance other considerations by which the charge can be discredited.
