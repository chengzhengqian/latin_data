<p>Our accentuation also is less attractive, on account both of its rigidity and of its very regularity, because the last syllable is never acute or circumflex, but words always end with one or two grave accents.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_301_69" id="target_note_LCL494_301_69"><sup>69</sup></a> Greek is therefore so much more agreeable than Latin that our poets adorn their verse with Greek names whenever they have wanted to achieve a dulcet effect. More importantly, many things have no names in Latin, and Metaphor or Periphrasis is essential; and even when things do have names, our great poverty<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_301_70" id="target_note_LCL494_301_70"><sup>70</sup></a> drives us back to re-use the same ones again and again.

If this is denied us, we must adapt our thoughts to the words we have, and not combine a slight subject with words that are too strong (I will not say “too rich”) for it, lest delicacy and strength are both lost by the mixture. The less help we get from the language, the more we have to fight our battles with Invention. Let us unearth lofty and varied thoughts; we shall need to stir every emotion, and illuminate our style by the brilliance of our Metaphors.

Even the minor talents among the Greeks have their own safe harbour. We generally carry more sail; so let a stronger wind fill our canvas. Not that we shall always stand out to sea, for sometimes one has to hug the shore.
