the gist of which is that a father, guided by one of his sons, catches his other son and the stepmother in adultery, and kills them: “Lead me, I am following; take this aged hand, and guide it where you will.” And a little later: “See, (he says) what you long did not believe. For my part, I cannot see: night and thick darkness rise before me.” This Figure has something particularly vivid about it; the facts seem not to be told us, but to be happening.</p>
<p>Clear and vivid descriptions of places are by some assigned to this excellence;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_59_74" id="target_note_LCL127_59_74"><sup>74</sup></a> others call it <span class="italic">topographia.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_59_75" id="target_note_LCL127_59_75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

But a more careful look easily shows that they are different species. In the first place, the Trope is more open and, although it says something different from what it means, it does not <span class="italic">pretend</span> something different, for the whole context is generally quite straightforward: an example is the passage of the speech against Catiline<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_59_78" id="target_note_LCL127_59_78"><sup>78</sup></a> which runs “Rejected by him, you migrated to your bosom friend, that excellent person, Metellus.” The Irony here is confined
