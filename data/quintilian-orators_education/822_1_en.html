can ever equal the prayers of Priam in his supplication to Achilles?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_279_49" id="target_note_LCL127_279_49"><sup>49</sup></a> Does not Homer transcend the limits of human talent in his words, his thoughts, his Figures, and the Disposition of his whole work? It takes a great mind, I will not say to rival, for that is impossible, but simply to appreciate his virtues.</p>

<p>Homer, indeed, has undoubtedly left all others, in every branch of eloquence, far behind, and especially the writers of epic,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_279_50" id="target_note_LCL127_279_50"><sup>50</sup></a> where the similarity of the material makes the comparison most cruel. Hesiod rarely rises to heights, and much of his work is filled with proper names; however, his moral maxims are useful, the smoothness of his vocabulary and Composition deserve praise, and he wins the palm in the middle style.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_279_51" id="target_note_LCL127_279_51"><sup>51</sup></a> On the other hand, in Antimachus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_279_52a" id="target_note_LCL127_279_52a"><sup>52</sup></a> it is the force, weight, and distinguished language which earn praise. The consensus of the grammarians gives him second place; but he is weak in emotional power, charm, Disposition, and indeed technique in general; he makes it very clear what a difference there is between coming next and coming second! Panyasis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_279_53" id="target_note_LCL127_279_53"><sup>53</sup></a> who combines the qualities of the last two, is regarded as not equal to either of them in style, but as superior to Hesiod
