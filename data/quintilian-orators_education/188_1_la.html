<p>Chapter 7 deals, fairly briefly, with the oratory of praise and blame, i.e. Epideictic. Basic ancient texts here include: Aristotle, <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 1.9; Cicero, <span class="italic">De inventione</span> 2.177–178, <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 2.43–47, 341–349 (very close to Quintilian); <span class="italic">Partitiones oratoriae</span> 70–82; Theon, <span class="italic">Progymnasmata</span> 109–112 Spengel; Menander Rhetor (with Russell and Wilson’s Introduction, xi–xxxiv). Modern works include Burgess (1902), Buchheit (1960); Pernot (1993); the handbooks all include discussions, e.g. Martin 177–210, Lausberg §§ 239–254.</p>
<p>After some introductory remarks (3.7.1–6), Quintilian proceeds to praise of gods (6–9) and men (10–18), and then to invective (19–22). There follows a section on the relation of the encomiast to his audience (23–25), and then the main scheme resumes with “praise of cities and places” (26–28).</p>
<p>Chapter 8 is a similar treatment of Deliberative Oratory. The essential parallel material is to be found in Aristotle, <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 1.4–8; <span class="italic">Rhetorica ad Alexandrum</span> 29–34; Cicero, <span class="italic">De inventione</span> 2.157–176, <span class="italic">De oratore</span> 2.333–340, <span class="italic">Partitiones oratoriae</span> 83–97. Outline in Martin 167–176, Lausberg §§ 224–238. Quintilian’s discussion falls into two main parts: (a) Introductory (3.8.1–15): here it is explained that the aim of Deliberative Oratory is dignity rather than expediency (1–3); that it may however involve Conjecture, Definition, and Legal Issues as well as Quality (4–6); and that it has its own rules for Prooemium, Narrative, and Emotional Appeal (6–13); (b) a more detailed discussion of (i) the nature of the proposal (16–35), (ii) the character
