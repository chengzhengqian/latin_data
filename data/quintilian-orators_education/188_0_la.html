based on Aristotelian logic) was mainly developed by Hermagoras, for whose views Quintilian is an important source. After Quintilian’s time, the number of distinct Issues was considerably enlarged; many writers held that there were thirteen, and this is the scheme found in Hermogenes of Tarsus, who was particularly influential, and in most later rhetoricians. Among modern accounts, note Heath (1995), esp. 70ff.; <span class="italic">GD</span> 40–73; Heath in <span class="italic">CRHP</span> 100–103; Calboli Montefusco (1986). Lausberg §§ 79–254 is exhaustive, mainly depending on Quintilian. An unusually clear exposition (with diagrams) is given by B. Schouler, <span class="italic">La tradition hellénique chez Libanios</span> (1984) 1. 170–185; this does, of course, relate to a period much later than Quintilian.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is thus unusually long and difficult, but its structure is fairly simple:</p>
<p>6.1. <span class="italic">Status</span> belongs to all three “kinds” of Cause.</p>
<p>6.2. Various names for it.</p>
<p>6.3. Early history.</p>
<p>6.4–22. Rival definitions and ways of identifying the Issue.</p>
<p>6.23–28. The basic elements are derived from or correspond with Aristotle’s Categories.</p>
<p>6.29–55. How many types of Issue are there? (one, 29–30; two, 31–43; three, 44–46; four, 47–50; five or more, 51–55).</p>
<p>6.55–62. Theories which distinguish Rational and Legal Issues.</p>
<p>6.63–90. Quintilian’s own views, past and present.</p>
<p>6.91–103. Cases involving more than one Issue, including (96–103) a detailed study of the Case of the Three Sons.</p>
