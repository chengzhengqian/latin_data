varied treatment, as all orators do most of the time. It is very rare to find in them the slavery (for slavery it certainly is) to certain particular words, which comes from the habits of the philosophers. Indeed Marcus Antonius in Cicero’s <span class="italic">De oratore</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_227_20" id="target_note_LCL126_227_20"><sup>20</sup></a> vetoes this practice. It is also dangerous, because, if there is an error in one word, we are seen to have failed in the whole case. The middle way is best, as taken by Cicero in <span class="italic">Pro Caecina,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_227_21" id="target_note_LCL126_227_21"><sup>21</sup></a> namely to set out the facts and not run risks with the words: “Certainly, Assessors,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_227_22" id="target_note_LCL126_227_22"><sup>22</sup></a> the violence which threatens our persons and our lives is not the only kind; much more serious is that which uses the danger of death to strike the mind with panic and often dislodge it from its place and its assured stability.” Alternatively, the Proof may precede the Definition: thus in the <span class="italic">Philippics,</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_227_23" id="target_note_LCL126_227_23"><sup>23</sup></a> Cicero infers that Servius Sulpicius was killed by Antony and concludes with a Definition: “He who was the cause of death surely brought that death to pass.” I would not deny that these moves too should be made, according to the needs of the Cause, and that if a Definition can be framed so as to be both secure and brief, this will then be elegant and indeed a great source of strength; but the Definition must be impregnable.</p>
<p>The order is fixed: first, <span class="italic">what</span> a thing is; then, whether it is <span class="italic">this.</span> There is usually more difficulty in establishing a Definition than in applying a Definition to a thing. In determining “what something is,” there are two tasks to perform: we must both establish our own Definition and destroy our opponent’s. Therefore in the school, where we ourselves make up “objections” to our position, we have to
