<p class="noindent">Previous Judgements (to begin with these) all fall under three heads: (1) matters on which judgement has been given in the past on parallel cases: these are more correctly called “precedents,” for example the rescinding of a father’s will or its confirmation against the opposition of his children; (2) judgements relevant to the same Cause (hence the name “Previous Judgements”), such as are said to have been given against Oppianicus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_327_1" id="target_note_LCL125_327_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or by the senate against Milo;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_327_2" id="target_note_LCL125_327_2"><sup>2</sup></a> (3) pronouncements in the same Cause, for example when defendants are deported,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_327_3" id="target_note_LCL125_327_3"><sup>3</sup></a> or an application for freedom is renewed, or when parts of a case in the Centumviral courts have been divided between two panels.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_327_4" id="target_note_LCL125_327_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Confirmation of such judgements is made in two main ways: by the authority of the judges in the previous case, and by the similarity of the cases in question.
