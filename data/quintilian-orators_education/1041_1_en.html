something of the authority he had earned; shameful as it may seem, when this once acknowledged king of the courts was pleading, some would laugh and some would blush; which gave an opportunity for the remark that “he would rather give in than give up.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_327_3" id="target_note_LCL494_327_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Yet his efforts, such as they were, were not bad, only less good than before.</p>

This done, the fruits of his studies will remain with him undiminished. He will either write a record for posterity<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_327_4" id="target_note_LCL494_327_4"><sup>4</sup></a> or (as Lucius Crassus plans in Cicero’s book)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_327_5" id="target_note_LCL494_327_5"><sup>5</sup></a> offer legal advice to inquirers, compose a treatise on oratory, or give fitting expression to the noblest precepts of morality.
