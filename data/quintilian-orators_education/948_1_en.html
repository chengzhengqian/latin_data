putting something down gently, not striking a blow. Sometimes however it is lowered at the end, but only to go back quickly; and sometimes it springs back, to express either denial or surprise.</p>
<p>The old experts on this subject rightly added at this point that the hand movement should begin and end with the sense, for otherwise the Gesture will either anticipate the voice or lag behind it, and in either case the result is unsightly. But their excessive subtlety led them into the mistake of recommending an interval of three words between movements; this is not observed, and is impracticable. The fact is that they wanted (very properly) to have some sort of measure of slowness and speed, so that the hand should not rest idle for long or fragment the delivery by continual movement, as is the practice of many speakers.</p>
<p>There is another mistake too, both commoner and easier to overlook. Language possesses certain hidden stresses, one might say metrical feet, and the Gestures of many speakers coincide with these: e.g. <span class="italic">novum crimen</span> (“new charge”)—one movement; <span class="italic">Gai Caesar</span>, a second; <span class="italic">et ante hanc diem</span> (“previous to this day”), a third; <span class="italic">non auditum</span> (“unheard of”), a fourth; then <span class="italic">propinquus meus</span> (“my relation”), then <span class="italic">ad te</span> (“before you”), then <span class="italic">Quintus Tubero</span>, then <span class="italic">detulit</span> (“brought”).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_141_70" id="target_note_LCL494_141_70"><sup>70</sup></a> From this flows another fault: when students are writing something and articulating their thoughts by rehearsing the Gestures, they tend to compose their sentences to fit the way in which the hand is to fall.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_141_71" id="target_note_LCL494_141_71"><sup>71</sup></a> This gives rise to yet another mistake: the Gesture, which ought to end on the right, often ends on the left. It is better therefore, in view of the fact that there are short units in all speech, where we can draw breath if we need to, to arrange the Gesture to fit these. For instance, <span class="italic">novum</span>
