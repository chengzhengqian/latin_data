Reliance on this makes us careless about learning by heart, and it mutilates and deforms the style. Personally, I am against writing anything we do not propose to memorize, because in this situation too our thoughts may revert to our carefully worked-up text and prevent us from taking any chance that presents itself. So the mind wavers between two alternatives: it has lost the written version, and it is not looking for anything new.</p>
