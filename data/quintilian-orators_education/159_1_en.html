the semblance of truth,” and, a little later, “The reward is not a good conscience, but the victory of the litigant.” If this were true, only a very bad man would give such dangerous weapons to criminals or help wickedness with his advice.</p>
<p>But it is up to these people to justify their own views. What I have undertaken is to fashion the perfect orator, and my first requirement is that he should be a good man. Let us therefore return to those who have sounder views on the subject.</p>
<p>Some think that rhetoric and politics are the same; Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_367_39" id="target_note_LCL124_367_39"><sup>39</sup></a> calls rhetoric a part of political science (and “political science” here means philosophy); and some think rhetoric and philosophy are the same (Isocrates was of this opinion).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_367_40" id="target_note_LCL124_367_40"><sup>40</sup></a> The definition which will best suit this notion of its real nature is that “rhetoric is the science of speaking well.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_367_41" id="target_note_LCL124_367_41"><sup>41</sup></a> This includes all the virtues of speech in one formula and at the same time also the character of the orator, because only a good man can speak “well.” Chrysippus’ definition, taken from Cleanthes, “the science of speaking rightly,” comes to the same thing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_367_42" id="target_note_LCL124_367_42"><sup>42</sup></a> Chrysippus gives other definitions also, but they relate rather to other problems. The same view would be implied in the formulation “to persuade what it is right to do,” except that this ties the art down to results.</p>
<p>Areus’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_367_43" id="target_note_LCL124_367_43"><sup>43</sup></a> formula is a good one: “to speak according to the virtue of speech.”</p>
