needed in private deliberations,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_123_13" id="target_note_LCL125_123_13"><sup>13</sup></a> at any rate a Narrative of the circumstances on which one is called upon to give an opinion, because everyone knows what it is that he is asking advice about; but many external circumstances relevant to the deliberation may be the subject of a Narrative. In public assemblies a Narrative explaining the order of events is often essential. As for emotional appeals, Deliberative demands these as much as any form of oratory does, because anger must often be aroused or assuaged, and the minds of the audience moved to fear, desire, hatred, or goodwill. Pity too must sometimes be excited, if you have to urge sending relief to the besieged, or to lament the destruction of an allied city. But the most important aspect of giving advice is the speaker’s own authority. Anyone who wants everybody to trust his judgement on what is expedient and honourable must be, and be thought to be, both very wise and very good. In the courts, it is commonly thought proper to indulge one’s prejudices to some extent; but advice, as no one can deny, reflects the speaker’s moral principles.</p>
<p>Most of the Greeks have held that this function is entirely concerned with public assemblies, and have limited it to the administration of the state. Cicero too devotes himself mainly to this, and so proposes that those who mean to give advice about peace and war, troops, public works, or revenue must be familiar with two subjects in particular, the strength of the state and its character, so that their advice may be based both on the realities of the situation and on the nature of the audience.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_123_14" id="target_note_LCL125_123_14"><sup>14</sup></a> It seems to me that things are more complicated, for there are many types both of people asking advice and of the advice that can be given.</p>
