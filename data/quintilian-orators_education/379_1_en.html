<p>(3) Time, as I have said in another context,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_387_42" id="target_note_LCL125_387_42"><sup>42</sup></a> has two meanings. It can be taken in a general or in a special sense. The general sense occurs in “now,” “formerly,” “under Alexander,” “when they fought at Troy,” and whenever we speak of past, present and future. The second sense refers both to regular distinctive periods of time—“in summer,” “in winter,” “at night,” “in daytime”—and to chance ones—“in time of plague,” “in war,” “at dinner.” Some Latin writers have thought that the meaning was sufficiently clear if they used the singular <span class="italic">tempus</span> of general Time, and the plural <span class="italic">tempora</span> of special Time. In both senses, Time is of course important in Deliberative and Epideictic oratory, but it is most often important in forensic cases. It produces Questions of Law, determines Quality, and makes a great contribution to Conjecture. Here it can sometimes provide irrefutable Proofs, for example (to take a case mentioned above),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_387_43" id="target_note_LCL125_387_43"><sup>43</sup></a> if a person who is said to be a signatory to a document died before the date on which it was signed, or if a person is said to have committed some crime when he was a baby, or was not born at all. Again, all Proofs can easily be derived from antecedent, contemporaneous, or subsequent events. (a) Antecedent. “You threatened him with death, you went out by night, you
