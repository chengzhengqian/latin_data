<p>This book covers Disposition, the second of the “five parts” of rhetoric. But what precisely is this? The doctrine of the “parts of a speech,” which in Aristotle (<span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> 3, 1414a29) was a matter of “order” (<span class="italic">taxis</span>), has already been treated (and Quintilian was not original in this) under “invention.” (For the history of this development, see W. Wuellner, <span class="italic">CRHP</span> 31–87.) What we have in Book Seven is in effect a supplement to the Theory of Issues outlined in Book Three, and it is unintelligible without this (see Introduction to Book Three for parallels and background). Quintilian now concentrates on the <span class="italic">divisio</span> (<span class="italic">diaeresis</span>), by which he means the main lines of argument which are to be followed; he has already given the analysis of the case in terms of the Issue and the types of Proof available. Such <span class="italic">divisiones</span> are given by the elder Seneca (<span class="italic">Controversiae</span> 1.1.13–14 is a good example), and later rhetoric systematized the theory much more than Quintilian has done: the best accounts (all post-Hermogenes, and thus using a Theory of Issues somewhat more sophisticated than Quintilian’s) are in Sulpicius Victor (325–352 Halm), Julius Victor (385–395 Halm = 19–31 Giomini–Celentano), and the Greek Sopatros (8. 2–384 Walz; with Innes and Winter-bottom (1988)). An overview of the subject is in Martin (213ff.), but Lausberg § 139 gives no separate treatment of
