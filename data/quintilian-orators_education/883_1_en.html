and long dresses, for these are the ornaments of women,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_11_2" id="target_note_LCL494_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the costume of the triumphant general<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_11_3" id="target_note_LCL494_11_3"><sup>3</sup></a> (than which nothing more august can be conceived) would be inappropriate for a woman.</p>
<p>Cicero touches on this subject in the third book of <span class="italic">De oratore</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_11_4" id="target_note_LCL494_11_4"><sup>4</sup></a> briefly but without seeming to have left out any essential feature: “A single style of oratory,” he says, “is not suited to every Cause, every audience, every speaker, or every occasion.” He says the same in the <span class="italic">Orator</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL494_11_5" id="target_note_LCL494_11_5"><sup>5</sup></a> almost as concisely. But in the first passage, Lucius Crassus, speaking in the presence of men who were great orators and very learned, finds it enough simply to hint at this subject, as it were, because they all know it; in the second, Cicero, addressing Brutus, acknowledges that his addressee knows all about these things, and accordingly says he is himself treating it more briefly, though it is an extensive topic and is discussed at greater length by philosophers. My professed subject is a system of education, and I address myself not only to those who know these things but also to learners; a somewhat longer discussion should therefore be pardoned.</p>
<p>We must first of all know what is appropriate for winning over, instructing, and emotionally affecting the judge, and what our object is in the different parts of a speech. We shall for example not make repeated use of archaic, metaphorical, or coined words in Prooemium, Narrative, or Argument, nor of runs of beautifully polished periods where the Cause has to be divided and set out under its various heads; nor again shall we employ low or colloquial language, without rhythmical structure, in the Epilogue—nor, finally, try to dry tears with a joke, when what is wanted is compassion. All Ornament depends not so much
