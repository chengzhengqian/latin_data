learn things which, if baldly and drily taught, would, I feared, disgust their minds and offend their ears, especially as they are now so very fastidious. This is the reason Lucretius gives for writing philosophy in verse: as we all know, he uses this simile:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent1">As when the doctors try to give to children</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">some bitter wormwood, first they smear the rim</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and so on. But I fear this book may appear to have too little honey and too much wormwood, and be more healthy for the student than agreeable. I fear too that it will find even less favour, because its contents will be for the most part not discoveries of mine but the doctrines of others, and at the same time encounter hostile criticism, because so many writers, though all moving towards the same goal, have constructed different roads to it, and have each made their disciples follow their special route. Those disciples, moreover, become committed to whatever road they entered on first, and it is very difficult to change boys’ opinions once they have been impressed upon them. Everybody prefers to have learned rather than to learn! But there is, as will appear in the course of this book, an infinite diversity of opinion among the authorities, because writers first added their own discoveries to what was previously still rough and imperfect, and then went on to change even what had been right, so as to appear to be contributing something of their own.</p>
