<p>History also can nourish the orator with its rich, sweet sap.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_269_29" id="target_note_LCL127_269_29"><sup>29</sup></a> But we should read it too in the knowledge that many of its excellences are to be avoided by the orator. History is very close to the poets. In a sense it is a prose poem, and it is written to tell a story, not to prove a point. Moreover, it is wholly designed not for practical effect and present conflicts, but to preserve a memory for future generations and for the glory of its author’s talents. It therefore avoids tedium in Narrative by employing more out-of-the-way words and freer Figures. So, as I said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_269_30" id="target_note_LCL127_269_30"><sup>30</sup></a> we should make no effort to recapture the famous conciseness of Sallust, when we are addressing a busy, distracted, and often unlearned judge, though nothing could be more perfect for the leisured and scholarly reader. Nor, on the other hand, will Livy’s creamy richness give clear enough information for a judge who looks not for elegance of exposition, but for credibility. Observe too that Cicero does not regard Thucydides or Xenophon as useful for the orator,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_269_31" id="target_note_LCL127_269_31"><sup>31</sup></a> though he thinks the former “sounds the call to arms,” and the latter was “the mouthpiece of the Muses.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_269_32" id="target_note_LCL127_269_32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, we can sometimes use even the elegance of the historian in Digressions, so long as we remember that, in passages where a Question is involved, it is not the athlete’s bulging muscles that we need but the soldier’s strong arm; and that the coat of many colours which Demetrius of Phalerum was said to wear is not much protection against the dust of the forum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_269_33" id="target_note_LCL127_269_33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>There is indeed another use for history, and a very vital one, but not relevant here. It derives from the knowledge
