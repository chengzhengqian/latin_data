most considered are anger, hatred, fear, desire, and hope. Other motives fall under species of these. If any of these applies to the accused, it is the prosecutor’s business to make the motives appear sufficient to produce a certain action, and to amplify the motives which he is going to use for his Argument. Otherwise, he must have recourse to suggesting either that there were perhaps some hidden motives, or that, if he did the deed, why he did it is irrelevant, or even that a crime is all the more abominable for being unmotivated. The defence advocate, on the other hand, will dwell whenever possible on the point that an unmotivated act is incredible. Cicero develops this with great vigour in many speeches, but especially in <span class="italic">Pro Vareno,</span> because Varenus had everything else against him. (After all, he was condemned!)

(Some motives may in fact be unknown at the time—for example, whether the man whom he is accused of killing had an heir, or was going to prosecute the defendant.) If all else fails, he will say that motives do not necessarily need to be considered: for whom can one find who does not fear, hate, or hope, and yet most people have these feelings and preserve their innocence! We must not forget either that all motives are not effective for all persons: for some, poverty may be a motive for stealing, but it will not have that force for a Curius or a Fabricius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_207_31" id="target_note_LCL126_207_31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The question is often asked whether we should deal with motivation or with character first. Orators’ practice varies; Cicero in fact frequently puts the motives first. I think the natural course is to begin with character, if the circumstances of the case do not weigh heavily in either direction. This is the more general point, and the more correct
