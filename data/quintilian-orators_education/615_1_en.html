So if you were to say, for example, “I saw a man a book writing,” although it is obvious that the man is writing the book, it will be a bad piece of Composition, and you will have made it as ambiguous as you could.</p>
<p>Some writers too produce a medley of pointless words. In their horror of normal forms of expression, they are seduced by the appearance of elegance into wrapping up everything in long-winded circumlocutions, just because they do not want to make the simple statement; they then proceed to join this string of words up to another of the same kind, stir them together, and spin it all out beyond the limits of anyone’s breath. Some even make an effort to acquire this vice; nor is it a new failing, for I find already in Livy that there was once a teacher who told his pupils to obscure what they were saying: he used the Greek word <span class="italic">skotison,</span> “Darken it!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL126_337_31" id="target_note_LCL126_337_31"><sup>31</sup></a> Hence the famous compliment, “Excellent!
