Therefore I do not see why they should specially assign it to the place next after the sequence of events, any more than why they should confine the name to cases where something has to be explained in a Digression: there are so many different ways of diverging from the straight path of a speech. After all, anything we say which does not fall under the Five Parts we have listed is an “egression”: bursts of indignation, appeals to pity, hostile comment, reproach, excuse, conciliatory remarks, refutation of slander, and anything similar which does not fall within the Question; so also all Amplification and Disparagement, every kind of emotional appeal, and those favourite sources of pleasure and ornament, the stock passages on luxury, avarice, religion, or duty.
