<span class="label"><span class="italic">Is rhetoric useful?</span></span>
<p class="noindent">The next question is whether rhetoric is useful.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_371_1" id="target_note_LCL124_371_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Some are in the habit of making a violent attack upon it and (most disgracefully) using the power of oratory to denounce oratory. It is eloquence, they argue, that snatches criminals from punishment, conduces sometimes by its deception to the condemnation of the innocent, leads deliberations astray, and excites not only sedition and mob violence but wars that can never be expiated; in short (they say) its greatest use is to stand up for falsehood against truth. Thus the comic poets accuse Socrates of teaching how to make the worse cause seem the better,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_371_2" id="target_note_LCL124_371_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Plato,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_371_3" id="target_note_LCL124_371_3"><sup>3</sup></a> on the other side, says that Tisias and Gorgias made similar promises. They add examples from Greece and from Rome and enumerate all those who have used an eloquence ruinous not only to individuals but to the common good in order to disturb or overthrow the institutions of states; this is why (they say) rhetoric was expelled from Sparta<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_371_4a" id="target_note_LCL124_371_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> and its powers curtailed at Athens, where speakers were forbidden to make emotional appeals.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL124_371_5" id="target_note_LCL124_371_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>On this principle, neither generals nor magistrates nor medicine nor philosophy itself will be “useful.” Flaminius
