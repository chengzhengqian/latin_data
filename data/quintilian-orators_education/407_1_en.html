<p>Similitude has much the same force as Example, especially when it is based on things nearly equal, without any admixture of metaphors: “Just as those who are used to taking bribes in the Campus tend to be particularly hostile to candidates who they think have withheld their money, so, on this occasion, judges of like character had arrived full of hostility to the defendant at that time.” <span class="italic">Parabolē,</span> which Cicero calls <span class="italic">collatio</span> (“comparison”),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_443_31" id="target_note_LCL125_443_31"><sup>31</sup></a> often fetches its terms of comparison from a distance. Nor is it only human actions which are compared with each other (as by Cicero, in <span class="italic">Pro Murena</span>:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_443_32" id="target_note_LCL125_443_32"><sup>32</sup></a> “But if sailors who are coming into harbour from the sea often take great trouble to give those who are setting out information about storms and pirates and coasts—for nature makes us think kindly of those who are entering on dangers we have been through ourselves—how, I ask, should I feel, who am now almost in sight of land after all my tossing at sea, towards this man, who, I know, will have great storms to weather?”)—but &lt;Similes&gt; of this kind can be drawn also from animals and even from inanimate objects.</p>

The saying occurs in the form <span class="italic">clitellae bovi sunt impositae, plane non est nostrum onus</span> in Cicero, <span class="italic">Ad Atticum</span> 5.15.3 (and Ammianus Marcellinus 16.5.10) and is taken to be a comic fragment (Ribbeck, <span class="italic">Comicorum Romanorum Fragmenta</span><sup>2</sup>, p. 122). The second interpretation seems supported by the Greek “proverb” σοφῶς ὁ βοῦς ἔφασκεν ἀστραβὴν ἰδὼν προσήκειν αὐτῷ τὸ σκεῦος, “It was clever of the ox to say, when he saw the pack-saddle, ‘That thing’s nothing to do with me’”: see Otto (1891) 57. But to find this in Q.’s version we should have to read, e.g., <span class="italic">“non nostrum” inquit “onus” bos clitellas &lt;videns&gt;.</span> It is, however, an “allegory”: so perhaps we could translate “Not my load, he says; it’s a case of the ox and the panniers.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL125_443_30a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL125_443_31"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL125_443_31" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">31</sup><span class="italic">De inventione</span> 1.30.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL125_443_31').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL125_443_32"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL125_443_32" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">32</sup>4.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL125_443_32').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
