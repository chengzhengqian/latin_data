Composition to be not unrhythmical (that would be inartistic and coarse) rather than to be rhythmical, this being a feature of poetry—just as we do not want people to be what is called “unathletic,” even if we do not want them to be professional athletes. But the pattern of a properly formed period made up of feet does need a name: and what name is more suitable than Number—<span class="italic">oratorical</span> Number, that is to say, on the same principle that we speak of Enthymeme as a <span class="italic">rhetorical</span> syllogism? For my part, to avoid the misrepresentation from which even Cicero was not exempt, I ask the reader, when I speak of Number in the sense of what is properly “composed,” and whenever I have in the past spoken like this, to understand me as meaning <span class="italic">oratorical</span> Number.</p>

<p>Arrangement has the task of linking together words already approved, chosen, and as it were allotted to it. Even words which combine harshly are preferable to words which are useless. Nevertheless, I am inclined to allow some choice here, so long as it is among words which have the same meaning and force, and also some additions, so long as these are not otiose, and some omissions, though not of essential words. I would allow also the use of Figures to vary case and number; variety in these, frequently introduced for the sake of the Composition, tends to be attractive also on its own account.</p>
<p>Again, where Analogy demands one form and Usage another, let Composition choose which it will: <span class="italic">vitavisse</span> or <span class="italic">vitasse</span> (“to have avoided”), <span class="italic">deprehendere</span> or <span class="italic">deprendere</span> (“to catch”).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_193_53" id="target_note_LCL127_193_53"><sup>53</sup></a> I shall not veto coalescence of syllables
