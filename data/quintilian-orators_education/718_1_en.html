one more charge of this kind still left”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_71_112" id="target_note_LCL127_71_112"><sup>112</sup></a> or “One thing suggests another.” (4) These methods also provide elegant transitions (not that transition is itself a Figure!), as when Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_71_113" id="target_note_LCL127_71_113"><sup>113</sup></a> tells the story of Piso, who had given orders to a goldsmith to make a ring for him, and then pretends to have been reminded by this of something else, and goes on: “This ring of Piso’s has reminded me of something which had entirely escaped me. How many honourable men do you think have had their gold rings stripped off their fingers by Verres?” (5) Pretended ignorance: “But the sculptor—who was it? Who? Thank you for reminding me, they said it was Polyclitus.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_71_114" id="target_note_LCL127_71_114"><sup>114</sup></a> This trick has other uses too, for it sometimes enables us to achieve another object from that which we seem to aim at, as Cicero here 〈also〉 contrives, while taunting Verres with his obsession with statues and pictures, to avoid being thought an enthusiast for such things himself, and Demosthenes, by means of his oath “by those who fell at Marathon and Salamis,” contrives to lessen the odium attaching to him from the disaster sustained at Chaeronea.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL127_71_115" id="target_note_LCL127_71_115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<p>Other ways of making a speech attractive include: (1) deferring the discussion of some points after mentioning them, thus entrusting them to the judge’s memory for safe keeping, and later calling in your deposit; (2) repeating some points with some Figure (repetition itself is not a Figure); (3) picking out some points and, as it were, putting different faces on the pleading. For oratory delights in variety and, just as the eye is held more by the sight of different things, so it always offers the mind some fresh object for its attention.</p>
