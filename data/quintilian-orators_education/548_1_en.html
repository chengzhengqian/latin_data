<p>Conjecture is derived, in the first place, from the past. This includes (1) Persons, (2) Motives, and (3) Designs. The natural order is: he wanted to do it, he was able to do it, he actually did it. (1) We must therefore consider first of all what sort of a person it is who is involved in the case. It is the accuser’s business to ensure that any attacks on character he makes are not only shaming but, so far as possible, appropriate to the charge which is before the court. If he calls a man accused of murder a debauchee or an adulterer, the discredit would indeed be damaging, but it would not do as much for the accuser’s credibility as if he showed him to be bold, insolent, cruel, and reckless. The defence advocate, if he can, must endeavour to deny, defend, or play down accusations which have been made; the next best thing is to dissociate these from the immediate Question. Some accusations are not only not in keeping with, but sometimes actually contrary to, the main charge: for example, if a man charged with theft is described as extravagant or careless, since contempt for money and desire for money do not seem to go together in the same person. Failing these remedies, we must have recourse to the plea that “this is not the question,” or “the man who has committed some offences has not necessarily committed all,” or “the prosecution felt confident in making false charges because they hoped that a damaged and wounded defendant could be crushed by the odium thus aroused.”</p>
