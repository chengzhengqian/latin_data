<p>the Cause occurs here, or because the Cause rests upon it.</p>
<p>So much for the origins of the name: now for what the thing is. Some have defined Issue as the “first conflict of the Causes”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_51_4" id="target_note_LCL125_51_4"><sup>4</sup></a> they have the right idea, I think, but have not expressed it properly. The Issue is not the first conflict—“You did it,” “I didn’t”—but what arises out of the first conflict, in other words, the type of Question. With “‘You did it’, ‘I didn’t’,” the Question is whether <span class="italic">he</span> did it. With “‘That is what you did’, ‘I didn’t do that’,” the Question is <span class="italic">what</span> he did. Since it is obvious from this that the first point has to be considered by Conjecture and the second by Definition, and both parties rest their case on this, the Question will be one either of a Conjectural or of a Definitional Issue. Suppose someone were to say “Sound is the conflict between two bodies.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_51_5" id="target_note_LCL125_51_5"><sup>5</sup></a> He would, in my opinion, be wrong, because the sound is not the conflict, but arises out of the conflict.</p>
<p>This is not a very serious matter (because the fact is understood however it is expressed), but from it has arisen a very great mistake in the minds of those who interpreted the words wrongly, and, because they had read the words “first conflict,” came to believe that the Issue must always be derived from the first Question, which is very wrong. For every Question necessarily has an Issue, because it consists of an attack and a response; but some Questions are proper to the Causes which are to be decided, whereas others are brought in from outside, though they contribute something to the total argument, as auxiliaries as it were; hence there are said to be more Questions than one in a single dispute. Of these, moreover, the least important often takes the first place; indeed it often happens that we abandon the points in which we have less confidence once
