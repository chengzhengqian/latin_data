our Cause where they are useful, or play them down where they present an obstacle. It sometimes happens also that the judge is either an enemy of ours or a friend of our opponents. Both parties need to deal with this situation, more particularly, I suspect, the party whom he seems to favour. There is sometimes a perverse desire to give judgement against friends or in favour of persons with whom the judge has a quarrel, and thus to commit an injustice to avoid giving the impression of having done so. And there have been some who have been judges in their own case: I find it stated in Septimius’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_189_14" id="target_note_LCL125_189_14"><sup>14</sup></a> books of <span class="italic">Observations</span> that Cicero<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_189_15" id="target_note_LCL125_189_15"><sup>15</sup></a> was once involved in such a Cause, and I myself spoke on behalf of Queen Berenice<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_189_16a" id="target_note_LCL125_189_16a"><sup>16</sup></a> before the Queen herself.

<p>Furthermore, if the judge seems to have come into court with a fixed opinion, this must be either destroyed or confirmed. We sometimes need also to calm judges’ fears (as Cicero in the <span class="italic">Pro Milone</span> strove to persuade them not to think that Pompey’s soldiers, who were stationed all round the court, were meant as a threat to them) or indeed sometimes to excite fears, as Cicero did in speaking against Verres. Of the two ways of doing this, the common and acceptable one is to warn against risking the displeasure of the Roman people and the transference of jurisdiction to other courts;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL125_189_17" id="target_note_LCL125_189_17"><sup>17</sup></a> the other, which is both rare and brutal,
