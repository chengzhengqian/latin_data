If necessity ever drives us to it, it will no longer be a matter of the orator’s art; and the same is true of an appeal—though this too is often useful—or an indictment of the judge before he gives his decision. It does not take an orator to make threats or lay information!</p>
<p>If the Cause gives us material for winning over the judge, some parts of this material—those which seem most favourable—should be selected for use in the Prooemium.

Theodorus in fact does not say this, but only that the judge should be softened up for the most important Questions. There would be nothing wrong with this view, if he did not make a universal rule of something which not every pleading allows and not every Cause requires. For, as the plaintiff speaks first, when the case is still unknown to the judge, how can we derive ideas from the Question? Of course the facts will have to be stated first. But let us suppose that some facts are so treated (our strategy will sometimes require this): will they include all the most important ones, that is to say the whole Cause? In that case, the Narrative will be over and done with in the Prooemium. But suppose, as often happens, the Cause is rather an awkward one. Should we not try to secure the judge’s goodwill from other parts of the speech, instead of exposing the naked harshness of our Questions without having first won his sympathy? If it
