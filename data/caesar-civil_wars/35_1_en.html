About seventy of our men fell in the initial encounter, among them Quintus Fulginius, formerly a first-cohort centurion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL039_71_69" id="target_note_LCL039_71_69"><sup>69</sup></a> of the fourteenth legion, who had reached that position from lower ranks because of his conspicuous courage; more than six hundred were wounded. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>Of Afranius’ men the casualties included Titus Castricius, chief centurion, and besides him four centurions and more than two hundred soldiers.</p>
