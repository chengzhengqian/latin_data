had often blown; on these, he kept thinking, they would be bound to place their trust. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>The more the time for the crossing passed, the more attentive to patrolling the fleet commanders became and the more confidence they gained in deterrence. Plus, there were frequent scolding letters from Pompey urging them, since they had not stopped Caesar when he was first on his way, to block the rest of his forces. And they expected the weather to get more difficult for crossing every day, with lighter winds. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>Prompted by these considerations, Caesar wrote to his men with some severity: “When you get a suitable wind, do not miss an opportunity for sailing, if you can set a course for either &lt;. . .&gt; or the coast belonging to Apollonia<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL039_231_40" id="target_note_LCL039_231_40"><sup>40</sup></a> and beach the ships there.” <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>These places were mostly free of the fleets’ patrols because they did not dare, he assumed, commit themselves too far from the harbors.</p>

With Mark Antony and Fufius Calenus directing operations, and the soldiers themselves urging them on and accepting any risk for Caesar’s safety, they weighed anchor when they got a wind from the south. The following day they were being carried past Apollonia and Dyrrachium, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>and when they were sighted from the mainland Gaius Coponius, who was in charge of the Rhodian fleet at Dyrrachium, led his ships out of the harbor. When he was already close to our ships in a rather light wind, that same south wind grew stronger and was a great help to our side. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>But this did not make Coponius desist from his attempt; hoping, rather, that even the storm’s violence could be overcome by the sailors’ effort and perseverance, he kept up his pursuit as they were carried past Dyrrachium by the wind’s great force.
