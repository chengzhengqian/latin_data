The tumbling barrels slid off and after sliding down were moved away from the sides by means of poles and pitchforks. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>Meanwhile beneath the gallery soldiers with crowbars were extracting the lowest stones of the enemy tower, which formed its foundation. The gallery’s defense was handled by our men from the brick tower with projectiles and catapults. The enemy was dislodged from their wall and towers; they were given no real chance to defend the wall. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>After a number of stones had been removed from the adjacent tower, there was a sudden collapse and part of it gave way.
