At one and the same moment the soldiers conveyed by boat were hurling weapons onto the outer rampart, the trenches were being filled with rubble, and legionaries were terrorizing the defenders of the inner fortification by bringing up ladders, catapults of every sort, and weapons.

The men conveyed by sea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL039_283_82" id="target_note_LCL039_283_82"><sup>82</sup></a> were put ashore from the ships between the two ramparts, where the work was unfinished. They attacked our men from behind and after driving them away from both fortifications forced them to turn and run.</p>
