to use your prostration or any temporary advantage to make demands that will increase my resources.

It is with reference to me that a new type of military command is now in place, such that one man presides over Rome’s affairs just outside the city and controls two very warlike provinces in absentia for years at a time. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>It is with reference to me that magistrates’ rights are being altered, such that men are not sent to govern provinces after serving as praetor or consul, as always, but after being approved and selected by a few men. It is with reference to me that the excuse of age is rendered invalid, such that men tested<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL039_119_101" id="target_note_LCL039_119_101"><sup>101</sup></a> in earlier wars are being recalled to command armies. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>It is with reference to me alone that a benefit always accorded to every victorious general has fallen into abeyance, namely, that after successful campaigns they return home and dismiss their armies with a degree of honor and certainly without humiliation. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>And yet I have borne everything patiently and will continue to do so. My present aim is not to take an army from you and keep it for myself, although this would not be difficult for me, but to prevent you from having an army to use against me. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>Accordingly, as I said, you must leave your provinces and dismiss your army. But if this happens, I will not harm anyone. This is the single and final condition for peace.”</p>
