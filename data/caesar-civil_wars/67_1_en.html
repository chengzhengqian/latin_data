As a result, the accounts of  these engineering feats are unusually hard to follow. It is likely that for these descriptions of siege works never seen by Caesar himself—they were destroyed and replaced with different structures before his return to Marseilles (2.14.4, 2.15)—he relied heavily on a report’s wording.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL039_135_11a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL039_135_12"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL039_135_12" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">12</sup>For “the height . . . platform,” editors often follow Oudendorp and Aldus with “When the height of the tower reached the level for a platform, they laid the beams onto the walls.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL039_135_12').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
