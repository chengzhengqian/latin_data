the enemy’s tower and wall. The gallery’s structure was like this:</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>First, two timbers of equal length were placed on the ground four feet apart. In these they inserted posts five feet tall. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>They joined each post to its opposite with trusses with a low pitch; on these they planned to place the beams to cover the gallery. On this structure they laid two-foot square beams and secured them with metal plates and spikes. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>At the edge of the gallery’s roof and the ends of the beams they fastened three-inch square<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL039_139_14" id="target_note_LCL039_139_14"><sup>14</sup></a> battens to hold in place the bricks to be laid on top. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>In this way, with the roof peaked and constructed in layers—since beams had been placed on trusses, clay on bricks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL039_139_15" id="target_note_LCL039_139_15"><sup>15</sup></a>—the gallery was covered so as to be safe from fire thrown from the wall. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>Hides were stretched over the bricks to prevent water released from pipes from being able to wash away the brickwork.

And suddenly, catching the enemy off guard, they used a naval maneuver—rollers under the gallery—and moved it up to the enemy’s tower so as to abut its structure.</p>
<p>11. Terrified by this emergency the townspeople rolled forward the largest possible stones with crowbars and sent them flying off the wall onto the gallery.
