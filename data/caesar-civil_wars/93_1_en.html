He ordered them to yield ground gradually and retreat with a show of fear, saying that he would give the signal for battle when the time was right. His orders, he said, would be whatever he saw the situation demanded. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> Curio’s assessment of the present situation—he thought the enemy was running away—added to his original optimism, and he brought his troops down from higher ground onto a level plain.</p>
