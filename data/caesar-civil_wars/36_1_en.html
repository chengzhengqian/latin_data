<p>48. An unexpected setback occurred two days after these events, for so powerful a storm arose that everyone agreed that the flooding in the area had never been more extensive. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>On that occasion the storm washed snow down from every mountain and overflowed the riverbanks and in a single day broke both of the bridges Gaius Fabius had made. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>These developments caused serious difficulties to Caesar’s army, for with his camp, as was indicated above, being between two rivers, the Sicoris and the Cinca—neither of these could be crossed for a stretch of thirty miles and of necessity everyone was confined within this narrow space.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL039_73_71" id="target_note_LCL039_73_71"><sup>71</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>The communities that had come over to Caesar could not supply him with provisions, nor could those who gone some distance to forage return, cut off as they were by the rivers, nor could the extensive supplies coming from Italy and Gaul reach Caesar’s camp. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>For the season was a very difficult one, such that there was no standing grain in the winter camps—and yet it was not far from maturity—and the local communities had been emptied out, since Afranius had taken practically all provisions to Ilerda before Caesar’s arrival. Whatever was left Caesar had consumed on the preceding days. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>As for livestock, which could have given additional support against scarcity, the nearby communities had moved it quite far away because of the war. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>Anyone who left camp to forage or collect provisions was pursued by Lusitanians, part of Afranius’ light-armed force, and by men knowledgeable about the area, native troops from Nearer Spain. It was a simple matter for these to swim across the river because all of them were customarily equipped with inflatable skins when they began a campaign.</p>
