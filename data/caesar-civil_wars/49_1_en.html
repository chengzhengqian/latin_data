in camp; there was no way to get help to them, cut off as they were by Caesar’s army. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>Caesar completed the distance first. Emerging from the rocky heights, he came to a flat area and drew up his line there facing the enemy. Afranius, with his rearguard under pressure from the cavalry and the enemy visible ahead, halted when he came to a hill. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>From there he sent four native cohorts to the highest mountain in sight.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL039_99_89" id="target_note_LCL039_99_89"><sup>89</sup></a> He ordered them to move at a fast run and seize this, thinking that he would head there with his entire force and so reach Otogesa by a new route along the ridges. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>When the native troops deviated toward this objective they were observed and attacked by Caesar’s cavalry.

It did not escape Caesar that after taking—and watching—such damage the terrified army could not hold out, particularly when surrounded on all sides by cavalry, since the battlefield was level and open. From every direction he heard demands for an engagement. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>Legionary commanders, centurions, and staff officers quickly gathered: “Do not hesitate to engage. The morale of all of our soldiers is at its peak. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>Afranius’ men, by contrast, have signaled their alarm in many matters: in not sending help to their own men, not coming down from the hill, barely withstanding the cavalry attacks, and not preserving their formations or units, given that they have collected their standards in a single spot and are crowded together. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>But if you are worried about the location’s drawbacks, there will be an opportunity to fight somewhere, because Afranius certainly has to withdraw from this area; he cannot stay long without water.”</p>
