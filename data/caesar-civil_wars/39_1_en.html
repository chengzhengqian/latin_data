<p>53. Afranius and Petreius and their friends sent amplified and exaggerated accounts of these events to their partisans at Rome. Rumors added many fictions,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL039_79_76" id="target_note_LCL039_79_76"><sup>76</sup></a> with the result that the war seemed practically over. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>After these letters and announcements were brought to Rome, people rushed in great numbers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL039_79_77" id="target_note_LCL039_79_77"><sup>77</sup></a> &lt;into&gt; the Forum and there were extensive congratulations. Many men started making their way from Italy to Gnaeus Pompey, some to be seen as the first with news like this, others to avoid being seen to have waited for the war’s result or to have arrived last of all.</p>

Since the situation had come to such a pass and every road was blocked by Afranius’ soldiers and cavalry, and it was impossible to complete the bridges, Caesar ordered his men to make boats of a type that he had learned about in his past experience of Britain. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>First, the keels and ribs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL039_79_78" id="target_note_LCL039_79_78"><sup>78</sup></a> were made from a light wood; the rest of the boat’s hull was woven from canes, then covered with hides. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>The finished boats were carried twenty-two miles from the camp at night on coupled wagons. Caesar put his men across the river on these boats and without warning occupied a hill that touched the riverbank. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>He fortified the hill quickly before his opponents could find out; he later brought a legion over to this spot. Within two days he finished the bridge, which he began from both banks at once.
