First—and this is obvious—draw to yourself senators, Roman
Knights, active and influential men of all other ranks.
Many energetic city folk, many influential and active
freedmen are about the Forum; as many as possible should
be most diligently brought by yourself or by mutual friends
to desire your success; pursue them, send agents to them,
show them how you esteem the benefaction. Then, reckon
up the whole city—all the Colleges,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_425_17" id="target_note_LCL462_425_17"><sup>17</sup></a> the wards, the hills;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_425_18" id="target_note_LCL462_425_18"><sup>18</sup></a>
if you strike a friendship with the leading men from among
their number, you will easily, through them, secure the
masses that remain. After that, comprehend in your mind
and memory the whole of Italy divided into its tribal divisions,
and let there be no town, colony, rural district, or indeed
any place in Italy where you have not a sufficiency
of support; inquire and seek out men everywhere, get to
know them, pursue them, secure them, see that they canvass
their localities for you and act like candidates on your
behalf. They will want you as a friend if they see that you
are anxious for their friendship; pursue the object of making
them understand that point by using discourse appropriate
to the purpose. Small-town and country folk think
themselves our friends if we know them by name; and if
indeed they think they are also gaining some protection
for themselves, they lose no opportunity of deserving it.
To the rest, especially to your competitors, they are total
strangers, whereas <span class="italic">you</span> know them and will easily recognize
them—without which there can be no friendship. Yet
merely to know them, though important, is not enough unless
it is followed by the hope of advantage and friendship,
