<p>(And, in case you think I have wandered from my own
classification of subject matter by putting this argument
into the part of the canvass concerning the People, my
view is that all this pertains to Popular Reputation rather
than to Zealous Aid of Friends. Although something of this
latter category enters in—gracious answers, zealous service
in friends’ affairs or dangers—I am here speaking of
ways to capture the masses, so as to fill your house before
dawn, to hold many people in hope of your protection, to
send them away better friends than they came, to fill as
many ears as possible with excellent reports of you.)</p>
<p>The next required talking point is <span class="italic">publicity</span>, which you
must court to the full. But for widespread publicity the
strong points are those of my whole discourse above—your
fame as an orator, the favour of the public revenue contractors
and the Order of Knights, the good will of the nobles,
the crowd of young men about you, the attendance of clients
defended by you, the numbers from Italian towns who
have obviously come for your sake; so that they say and believe
that you know people well, solicit them courteously,
canvass continuously and thoroughly, are a gracious and
generous person; and so that your house is full long before
dawn with crowds of all classes, you give satisfaction to everybody
in what you say and to many in what you actually
do, you achieve the result (so far as hard work, skill, and application
can achieve it) that the People itself, instead of
hearing at second hand from these acquaintances of yours,
shares their devotion to you. You have already won over
those city masses and the favour of their political managers
by advancing Pompey, by undertaking the case of Manilius
and defending Cornelius;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_439_24" id="target_note_LCL462_439_24"><sup>24</sup></a> we have to mobilize the support
