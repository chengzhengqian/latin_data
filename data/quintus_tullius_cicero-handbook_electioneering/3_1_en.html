<p>Another great help for your status as a “new man” is
that your noble competitors are persons of whom nobody
would venture to say that they should get more from their

him declare on oath that he cannot compete in fair trial in
Rome against a Greek; we know he was expelled from the

and Panthera were his only friends, when he had no slaves
