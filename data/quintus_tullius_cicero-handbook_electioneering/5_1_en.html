so sacred and holy that he did not leave it under suspicion
of being polluted by his mere wickedness, even if other
people were guiltless; who got as his closest friends from
the Senate House men like Curius and Annius, from the
auctioneers’ halls men like Sapala<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_413_10" id="target_note_LCL462_413_10"><sup>10</sup></a> and Carvilius, from
