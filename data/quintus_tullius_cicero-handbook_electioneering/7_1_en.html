to two objects, the one concerned with securing
support of friends, the other with securing favour of the
People. The endeavours of friends should be enlisted by
kindnesses and observance of duties and old acquaintance
and affability and natural charm. But that word “friends”
has a wider application in a canvass than in the rest of life,
for anybody who shows you some good will, or cultivates
your society, or calls upon you regularly, is to be counted as
a “friend.” Still, it is very useful to be on affectionate and
pleasant terms with those who are friends on more genuine
grounds—ties of blood or marriage, fellowship in a Sodality,
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_417_15" id="target_note_LCL462_417_15"><sup>15</sup></a> or some other bond. Next, all those who are nearest
and most in your family circle must with every effort be
brought to feel affection and wish you all possible success;
so too must your fellow tribesmen, neighbours, and clients,
then your freedmen, and finally even your slaves, for
the talk which makes one’s public reputation generally emanates
from sources in one’s own household. Then, you
must set up friends of every sort: for show, men of illustrious
career and name (who bring a candidate some prestige,
even if they do not take an active interest in canvassing);
to maintain your legal rights, magistrates (especially
the consuls; next the tribunes of the People); for getting
the votes of the centuries, persons of exceptional influence.
Take special pains to recruit and retain those who
have from you, or hope to have, control of a tribe or a century,
or some other advantage; for in these days, electioneering
experts have worked out, with all their eager will
and resources, how to get what they want from their fellow
tribesmen. Work by any means you can to make these persons
sincere and whole-hearted supporters of your cause.
