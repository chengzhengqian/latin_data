<p>Although you are furnished with all that men can acquire
by ability, experience, or application, I thought it in
keeping with our affection to write in full to you what has
been coming into my mind as I think day and night about
your canvass—not that you would learn anything new from
it, but for the sake of bringing into one focus, by logical
classification, matters which in real life seem disconnected
and indeterminate. Though nature is strong indeed, yet an
assumed personality can, it seems, overcome the natural
self for an affair of a few months.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_405_1" id="target_note_LCL462_405_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Consider what city this is, what is it you seek, who you
are. Every day or so, as you go down to the Forum, you
must repeat to yourself: “I am ‘new’; I seek the consulship;
this is Rome.”</p>
<p>For your status as a “new man” you will compensate
chiefly by your fame as a speaker. Great prestige has always
attached to this; an advocate deemed worthy to defend exconsuls
cannot be thought unworthy of the consulship.
