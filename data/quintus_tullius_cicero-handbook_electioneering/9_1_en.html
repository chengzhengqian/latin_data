your interests, by indicating that you return their good will,
by carrying the acquaintance to a hope of close intimacy. In
all these categories, judge and ponder each man’s capacity,
in order to know how you should cultivate him and what

expect of each, realize what you get, and remember what

friendships are acquired in the canvass itself, since a canvass,
