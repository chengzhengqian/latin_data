you can and should do—it will not be a hard contest with
these competitors who are by no means as eminent in birth
as they are notable in vice. Can there be a citizen so vile as
to want to unsheathe, with one vote, two daggers against
the State?</p>
<p>Having explained what compensations for your status
as a “new man” you have or could have, I think I should
speak of the importance of this canvass. You seek the consulship,
and there is nobody who does not think you worthy
of the office, but many who envy you. You, by origin a
Knight, seek the highest place in the body politic—the
highest, and to a brave, accomplished, and upright man
this office brings far more dignity than to any others. Do
not think that those who have held the office will fail to see
how much prestige will be yours when you have reached it.
Men of consular families who have not risen to the position
of their ancestors envy you, I suspect, unless they are very
fond of you; and I think “new men” of praetorian standing,
unless attached to you by your kindnesses, do not want to
be surpassed by you in rank. Then, how many among the
people are envious, how many, in the fashion of these
years, are averse to “new men” in office, is a point which
occurs to you, I am quite sure; and a good many must be
angry with you in consequence of the cases that you have
pleaded. Then, turn your thoughts to this: do you not think
that certain people will be less than friendly because of
your devoted efforts to glorify Pompey? Therefore, since
you seek the highest place in the body politic, and since
you see that there are interests opposed to you, it is necessary
to apply all your judgement and care and effort and
attentiveness.</p>
