for all its nuisances, has the convenience that you can
make friends of any people you wish without disgrace,
which you cannot do in the rest of life. If at some other
time you were to exert yourself to court friendship with
them, you would seem to act in bad taste; but in a canvass
you would be thought a very poor candidate if you did
not so act and with vigour too in connection with many
such people. But I assure you that there is nobody (unless
closely connected with one of your competitors in some
way) whom you cannot easily induce, if you try, to earn
your affection and obligation to him by doing you a good
turn—that is, if he conceives that you value him highly,
that you are sincere, that it is a good investment for him,
that the result will not be a brief vote-catching friendship
but a solid and permanent one. Believe me, there will be
nobody, in so far as he is of the least intelligence, who will
miss this opportunity offered to him of setting up a friendship
with you, especially as chance gives you competitors
whose friendship is to be despised or shunned, and who
cannot even begin—let alone accomplish—what I amurging
you to do. For how should Antonius begin to attach or
invite to his friendship people whom he cannot call by
their names without a prompter? To my mind, nothing is
so silly as to think that a man whom you do not know is
your eager supporter. It needs outstanding renown, prestige,
and achievements to make strangers, if no one solicits
them to do so, confer an honour upon one. A lazy good-fornothing,
with no sense of duty, no brains, a bad name, and
no friends, cannot outpace a man supported by the favour
of most people and the approbation of all, unless gross
negligence is to blame. Therefore, take care to secure all
the centuries through many friends of different sorts.
