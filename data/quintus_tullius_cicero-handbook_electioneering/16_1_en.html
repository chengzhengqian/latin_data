you and your friends should often convoke the people at
large or tribe by tribe; also in rendering services, which you
will widely advertise, and seeing that you are approachable
day and night, not only through the door of your house but
through your facial expression, which is the gate of the
mind; if it shows that your feelings are reserved and withdrawn,
it hardly matters that your door is open. People
want not only promises (especially in their demands from a
candidate), but promises made in a lavish and complimentary
way. And so—an easy rule—if you are going to do what
is asked, show that you will do it willingly and gladly; but
the next thing is harder, and accords better with your circumstances
than with your character: whatever you cannot
