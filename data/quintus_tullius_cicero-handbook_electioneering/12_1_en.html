so that you are seen to be a good friend and not only a
recollector of names. So, when those whose own electioneering
ambition has gained them most influence with their
tribesmen are busy for you in the centuries—and when
you have established, as persons desirous of your interests,
those others who carry weight with some of their tribesmen
by reason of their home town, district, or College—then
your hopes should be high. And the centuries of
Knights<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_427_19" id="target_note_LCL462_427_19"><sup>19</sup></a> can, I think, be secured much more easily, with
care. First you should get to know the Knights (there are
not many); then, try hard to win them (young men at that
age are much more easily attached as friends). Further,
you have with you those of the best breeding and highest
culture among the young generation; and then, as the Order
of Knights is on your side, they will follow the Order’s
authority, if you take the trouble to secure its centuries not
only by the general good will of the Order, but by individual
friendships. Young men’s enthusiasm in winning support,
visiting electors, carrying news, and attending on you
is amazingly important, and confers credit on you.
And now that I have mentioned attendance, you must
take care to have it daily, from all sorts and ranks and ages,
for the very numbers will give an idea of the resources of
strength you will have at the poll itself. This subject falls
into three parts: the first, callers at your house; the second,
escorts from your house; the third, attendants in general.
The callers are a more promiscuous crowd, and in the fashion
of today visit more than one candidate. You must make
even this small service of theirs appear to be very gratifying
