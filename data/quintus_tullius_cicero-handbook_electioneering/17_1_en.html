you, but I am going to have regard for your present circumstances.
If you tell people that you cannot help them because
of some personal duty to others, they may still go
away pacified and unruffled; but if you refuse because
you are prevented (you say) by affairs of friends or by
previous<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_437_22" id="target_note_LCL462_437_22"><sup>22</sup></a> or more important engagements, they go away
hating you; they are all in the mood that they had rather
you lied to them than refused them. C. Cotta,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_437_23" id="target_note_LCL462_437_23"><sup>23</sup></a> a past master
of electioneering, used to say that (unless duty forbade
a request) he used to promise his help to all, but give it to
those in whom he expected he was making the best investment;
he refused nobody because it often turned out, for
some reason, that the man to whom he had promised help
did not use it, or that he himself was less busy than he expected;
if one undertook only what one could be sure to
perform, one’s house would be empty; by chance, a case
you didn’t expect is tried, but one you thought you were
busy with is not tried for some reason; and finally, the anger
of the man to whom one lied would be the last event in
the series—for if you do promise, the anger is uncertain,
not immediate and occurs in fewer cases; but if you refuse
you are sure to rouse antagonism at once, and in more people;
since those who ask that they be allowed to employ the
services of a person are many more than those who actually
employ them. So it is better that some of these people
should sometimes be angry with you in the Forum than all
of them all the time in your house—especially as they are
much angrier with those who refuse them than with a man
who (as they see) has a reason for not fulfilling his promise,
although he would want to do so if he possibly could.</p>
