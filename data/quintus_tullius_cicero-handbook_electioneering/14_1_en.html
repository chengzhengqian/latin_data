you. Demand of them plainly that since it is due to your unpaid
efforts that they have retained their property, or their
reputation, or their life and all their fortunes, and since
there will never be another chance for them to thank you,
they should repay you by this service.</p>
<p>Now, since all this discourse of mine is concerned with

say what point under this heading requires caution. All
