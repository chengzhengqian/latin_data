had been brought to the city in regard to Publius Scipio, the proconsul, who was in Sicily, alleging that he was leading a life of indulgence there, representatives were for this reason sent by the senate to discover whether the charges were true. Being cleared of evil repute Scipio crossed over to Africa by permission of the senate. Syphax, having received in marriage the daughter of Hasdrubal son of Gisgo, renounced the friendship which he had made with Scipio. Masinissa, King of the Massylians, while serving in Spain for the Carthaginians, after losing his father Gala, had been excluded from the kingship. When he repeatedly sought to regain it by war, he was defeated by Syphax, King of the Numidians, in a number of battles and was completely dispossessed. And as an exile with two hundred horsemen he joined Scipio and with him at the very beginning of the campaign he slew Hanno son of Hamilcar, together with his large force. Scipio, on the arrival of Hasdrubal and Syphax, who had come with almost a hundred thousand armed men, was forced to raise the siege of Utica and fortified a winter camp. Sempronius, the consul, fought successfully against Hannibal in the territory of Croton. Between the censors, Marcus Livius and Claudius Nero, there was a memorable quarrel. For Claudius took away his colleague Liviusâ€™ horse because he had been condemned by the people and driven into exile, and Livius did the same for Claudius because the latter had borne false witness against him and because he had not been sincere in being reconciled with him. Likewise Livius left all the tribes but one mere tax-payers, because they had both condemned him, though innocent, and had later made him consul and censor. The rite of purification was completed by the censors. The number of citizens listed was 214,000.</p>
