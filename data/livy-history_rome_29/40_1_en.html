Scipio and against Scipio. In addition to the crime <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 204</span>
of Pleminius and the sufferings of the Locrians, they kept censuring even the personal appearance of the general-in-chief, as not even soldierly, not to say un-Roman; that wearing a Greek mantle and sandals he strolled about in the gymnasium, giving his attention to books in Greek and physical exercise;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_285_1" id="target_note_LCL381_285_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that with equal indolence and self-indulgence his entire retinue<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_285_2" id="target_note_LCL381_285_2"><sup>2</sup></a> was enjoying the charms of Syracuse; that Carthage and Hannibal had been forgotten; that the entire army, being spoiled by lack of restraint and, like the army formerly at Sucro in Spain, like the troops now at Locri, was more to be feared by allies than by the enemy.</p>
