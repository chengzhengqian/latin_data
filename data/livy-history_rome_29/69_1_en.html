On the same day on which these events took place the ships which had carried booty to Sicily happened to return with supplies, as though with a presentiment that they had come for booty a second time. Not all the historians vouch for the slaying of two Carthaginian commanders of the same name in two cavalry battles, fearing, I suppose, unwittingly to tell the same story twice.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_343_1a" id="target_note_LCL381_343_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Coelius and Valerius, to be sure, relate that Hanno too was captured.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_343_2" id="target_note_LCL381_343_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
