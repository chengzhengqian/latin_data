The fifth and sixth legions were those from Cannae. Having said he would transport these legions to Africa, he inspected the soldiers one by one, and leaving those whom he believed to be unfit, he substituted for them men whom he had brought with him from Italy, and recruited the legions to such an extent that each had six thousand two hundred infantry<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_305_2" id="target_note_LCL381_305_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and three hundred cavalry. In like manner he chose foot-soldiers
and horse from the Latin allies out of the army which fought at Cannae.</p>
<p>XXV. As to the number of soldiers transported to Africa the authorities differ by no small figure. In some I find that ten thousand infantry, two thousand two hundred cavalry were embarked; in others sixteen thousand infantry, sixteen hundred cavalry; in others the total is more than doubled—thirty-five thousand infantry and cavalry. Some authorities have not introduced the figures, and it is among these that I should myself prefer to be counted in view of the uncertainty. Coelius, while he gives no figures, nevertheless immensely increases the impression of great numbers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_305_3" id="target_note_LCL381_305_3"><sup>3</sup></a> He says that birds fell to the ground owing to the shouts of the soldiers, and that such a multitude boarded the ships that not a human being seemed to be left either in Italy or Sicily.</p>
