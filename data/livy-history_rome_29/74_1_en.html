This source of revenue was generally believed to have been devised by only one of the censors, who was angry with the people because he had formerly been condemned by an unjust verdict; and that in the price of salt those tribes by whose efforts he had been condemned were most heavily burdened.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_353_2a" id="target_note_LCL381_353_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> Hence the cognomen Salinator was bestowed upon Livius.</p>
<p>The ceremony of purification was completed later than usual because the censors had sent men to the various provinces to report the number of Roman citizens in each of the armies. Including these, 214,000 men<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_353_3" id="target_note_LCL381_353_3"><sup>3</sup></a> were listed. Gaius Claudius Nero concluded the rite of purification.
