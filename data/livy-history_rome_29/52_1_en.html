<p>XXVI. Many Roman fleets had sailed from Sicily and out of that very harbour. Yet not only during that war was there never a sailing so spectacular—and
no wonder, since most of the fleets had sailed out merely to plunder—but there had been nothing similar even in the previous war. And yet if one had based his comparison upon the size of the fleet, more than once<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_309_3" id="target_note_LCL381_309_3"><sup>3</sup></a> before had two consuls with two armies made the passage, and there had been almost as many war-ships in those fleets as now transports with which Scipio was crossing over.
