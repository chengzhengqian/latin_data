<p>XXXI. Hasdrubal happened to be with Syphax<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_327_1" id="target_note_LCL381_327_1"><sup>1</sup></a> all the time that these events were in progress. And when the Numidian said he believed it was of no great importance to him whether the kingdom of the Maesulians was in the hands of Lacumazes or of Masinissa, Hasdrubal said he was very much mistaken if he believed that Masinissa would be content with what had satisfied his father Gala or his uncle Oezalces; that he had in him a far greater gift of spirit and talent than had ever been found in any man of his tribe; that often in Spain he had given allies and enemies alike evidence of a courage rare among men. He added that unless Syphax and the Carthaginians should put out that incipient flame, they would be consumed later by a mighty conflagration when they could no longer cope with it; that Masinissa’s strength was still slight and frail, while he was nursing a kingdom whose wounds had barely begun to heal. By insisting and goading him on Hasdrubal brought him to the point of advancing his army to the frontier of the Maesulians and pitching his camp as though upon soil to which he was unquestionably entitled—land concerning which he had not only argued with Gala repeatedly but had contended also in arms. If anyone should try to drive him away he would fight a regular battle, which would be greatly to his advantage. But if Masinissa in fear should withdraw from that region they must advance into the interior of the kingdom. Either the Maesulians would submit without resistance to the rule of Syphax, or they would be no match for him in arms.</p>
