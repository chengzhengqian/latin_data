<p><span class="sc">Gaius Laelius</span>, having been sent by Scipio from Sicily to Africa, brought back immense booty and delivered to Scipio Masinissa’s messages, complaining because he had not yet transported his army to Africa. The war which Indibilis had stirred up in Spain was brought to an end with the Roman as victor. He himself was slain in battle; Mandonius was surrendered by his own people to the Romans in response to their demand. To Mago, who was at Albingaunum, among the Ligurians, a large contingent was sent from Africa and also funds with which to hire auxiliaries; and he was ordered to unite with Hannibal. Scipio crossed over from Syracuse into the Bruttian territory and recovered Locri by defeating the Punic garrison and putting Hannibal to flight. Peace was made with Philip. The Idaean Mother was brought to Rome from Pessĭnus, a town in Phrygia, since in the Sibylline books verses had been found, saying that a foreign enemy could be driven out of Italy if the Idaean Mother should be brought to Rome. And she was delivered to the Romans by Attalus, King of Asia. It was a stone which the natives said was the Mother of the gods. She was received by Publius Scipio Nasica, son of that Gnaeus who had perished in Spain. He was adjudged the best man by the senate, because, although he was a young man who had not yet been quaestor, the oracle commanded that that divinity should be received and consecrated by the best man. The Locrians sent envoys to Rome to complain of the lawless conduct of Pleminius, the legatus, who had carried off the money of Proserpina and had outraged their children and their wives. He was taken in chains to Rome and died in the prison.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_361_1" id="target_note_LCL381_361_1"><sup>1</sup></a> When an unfounded report
