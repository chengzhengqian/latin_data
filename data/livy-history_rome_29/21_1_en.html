Thinking that he would do what he could for the sake of the Roman people, they decided to send ambassadors to him. These were Marcus Valerius Laevinus, who had been twice consul<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_247_1" id="target_note_LCL381_247_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and had held a command in Greece, Marcus Caecilius Metellus, an ex-praetor, Servius Sulpicius Galba, an ex-aedile, and two former quaestors, Gnaeus Tremelius

The ambassadors on the voyage to Asia made their way up to Delphi and consulted the oracle, enquiring what hope of accomplishing the task for which they had been sent from home it foresaw for themselves and the Roman people. The response, they say, was that they should gain what they sought with the help of King Attalus; that after conveying the goddess to Rome they were then to make sure that the best man at Rome should hospitably welcome her. They came to the king at Pergamum. He courteously received the ambassadors and, escorting them to Pessǐnus in Phrygia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_247_3" id="target_note_LCL381_247_3"><sup>3</sup></a> presented them with the sacred stone<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL381_247_4" id="target_note_LCL381_247_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
