<p><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> The interpretation I am adopting for <span class="italic">bynny id</span>
(“they have shown by hand”) is that of Sznycer. I do so hesitatingly.
<span class="italic">Bynny</span>, “they have shown,” is relatively unproblematic,
but yd, “hand,” has no Latin equivalent and does
not fit in well syntactically; one would expect it to be combined
with a preposition, and even then the phrase is unparalleled.
Gray renders the phrase as BNW ‘WD,“to us
there is testimony.” BNW is the preposition B with a first-
person
plural suffix. ‘WD, only attested in Hebrew, can
stand for a witness as well as his testimony. The main problem
with Gray’s analysis is that Hanno consistently refers to
himself in the first-person
singular, not the first-person
plural.
Krahmalkov’s interpretation is equally problematic.
To
begin with, it involves two emendations: instead of <span class="italic">bynny</span>
<span class="italic">id</span>, one has to read <span class="italic">hynny yyd</span>. The first word would be the
deictic particle HN; here the only problem
is that Plautine
Punic does not normally render H. The second word would
belong to the verbal root ‘WD, “give witness” (only attested
in Hebrew); here we would be dealing with the
third-person
masculine singular hoph’al, a stem which has
passive meaning, so this would roughly correspond to Latin
<span class="italic">monstratust</span>, “he was shown.” Perhaps the solution is to accept
Sznycer’s <span class="italic">bynny</span> and to emend <span class="italic">id li</span> to <span class="italic">ili</span>, “they”; in
that case the first part of the line simply means “they have
shown that.”</p>
