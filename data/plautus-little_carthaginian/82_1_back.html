sounds. In addition, the glides <span class="italic">y</span> and <span class="italic">w</span> were not preserved in
a number of environments.</p>
<p>In some cases the loss of such consonants led to compensatory
lengthening of preceding vowels. Similar changes happened
in Hebrew, where such consonant signs could from then
on be used to mark long vowels as well as consonants. Consonantal
signs used in vocalic function are called <span class="italic">matres lectionis</span>
(“reading aides”). Like Hebrew, Punic makes use of them, albeit
in a more limited way; for instance, Punic inscriptions often
use’ at the end of a word to indicate a long vowel, which
in Phoenician remained unmarked.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_179_7" id="target_note_LCL260_179_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>A number of Punic inscriptions in the Greek and Latin alphabets
exist. These inscriptions are not always easy to understand,
because the Greek and Latin alphabets are so different
from their original Phoenician source that they cannot render
the Punic consonantal phonemes adequately. Furthermore,
even where these two daughter alphabets can render Punic
sounds well, because Punic has, for instance, merged <span class="italic">k</span> and <span class="italic">q</span>,
the more phonetic spellings are not always useful, because a
more conservative orthography in the Punic script can help us
to identify lexemes more easily by comparing them with their
equivalents in older Phoenician texts. On the other hand, such
inscriptions in the Greek and Latin alphabets help us to understand
the Punic vowel system. However, even though the
Greek and Latin alphabets can render vowels more clearly than
the late Punic system of <span class="italic">matres lectionis</span>, they are not nearly
as helpful as the Phoenician consonant alphabet is for understanding
the consonantal phonemes of the language.</p>
