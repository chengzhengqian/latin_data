than late Punic, partly because they are still closer to the other
Canaanite languages, the best way to deal with the late inscriptional
evidence in the Greek and Latin alphabets is to transpose
them into the Phoenician script or a Romanized version
thereof with special characters; then the consonants are more
clearly differentiated. Editors have to make the difficult
decision
whether, for instance, a Latin <span class="italic">t</span> corresponds to a Phoenician
<span class="italic">t</span> or <span class="italic">ṭ</span>, but such a procedure enables us to see better what
words we are dealing with, even if it is also somewhat anachronistic
because of the mergers of sounds and the subsequent
orthographic confusions mentioned above. When it comes to
interpreting these late texts, the contribution of the vowels is
less important, however significant it is linguistically.</p>
<p>Scholars working on the Punic attested in Plautus use essentially
the same procedure as for Punic inscriptions in the
Latin alphabet. However, not all Punic texts in Plautus follow
the same Latin conventions of orthography. The first Punic text
in the <span class="italic">Poenulus</span> is Hanno’s entrance monologue. There are two
versions of it, commonly called Text 1 (ll. 930–39) and Text 2
(ll. 940–49); of this monologue, a Latin equivalent exists (ll.
950–60, without the spurious l. 954<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_180_8" id="target_note_LCL260_180_8"><sup>8</sup></a>), which is of great help in
understanding the Punic.</p>
<p>Text 1 is transmitted only in the Palatine manuscripts. It
frequently contains the letter <span class="italic">y</span> and the digraphs <span class="italic">ph, th,</span> and
<span class="italic">ch.</span> The letter <span class="italic">y</span> corresponds to the Punic vowel sound <span class="italic">u</span> (and
sometimes <span class="italic">i</span>), and the digraphs correspond to the nonemphatic
stops <span class="italic">p, t</span>, and <span class="italic">k.</span> The letter <span class="italic">y</span> and the digraphs were not needed
for purely Latin words and occurred in transliterations of

that Text 1, Text 2, and the Latin version are each ten lines long.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL260_180_8').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
