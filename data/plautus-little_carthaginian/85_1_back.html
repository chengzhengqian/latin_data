vowel alternations; sometimes feminine singular nouns also
show special suffixes. There are only two genders, masculine
and feminine. The masculine plural ends in -<span class="italic">im</span>
and the feminine
plural in -<span class="italic">ut</span>.
Just as in other languages, not all nouns
have stable gender. Thus the noun YM, “day,” is masculine and
mostly has the masculine plural ending, but, as in Hebrew, the
feminine plural ending occurs here as well (see l. 934).</p>
<p>Possessive relations are expressed in a way that is fundamentally
different from English. In the English phrase <span class="italic">John’s
house</span>, for example, the possessor is marked by a suffix and
the possessum remains unchanged. In <span class="italic">the house of John</span>, the
word order is different, but it is still the possessor, <span class="italic">John</span>, that is
marked, this time with a preposition. In Punic the possessum
regularly precedes the possessor and the latter remains unmarked.
The possessum, by contrast, undergoes vowel weakening
and sometimes takes a special suffix; in Semitic grammars
one speaks of the possessum being in the “construct state.” An
example occurs in l. 1027 (<span class="italic">gune bal samem</span>). The first noun,
G’N, “majesty,” normally has a plural G’NM, but here the plural
is in the construct state, <span class="italic">gune</span>; B‘L, “lord,” is also in the
construct state, though here no change can be seen; and ŠMM,
“heavens,” is unmarked. The whole phrase then means “the
majesty of the lord of the heavens.”</p>
<p>Punic also has a definite article, H-, “the.” Its use, however,
is not obligatory if a noun is definite, and in our text it rarely
occurs.</p>
<p>Not much needs to be said about word formation here.
Punic can form nouns from verb roots by attaching a prefix
<span class="italic">m</span>- (as in l. 933) or <span class="italic">t</span>- (as perhaps in l. 939). The <span class="italic">m</span>-nouns
mostly
indicate actions described by the verb root. The <span class="italic">t</span>-nouns
have
similar functions but are much rarer.</p>
