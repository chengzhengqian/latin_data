Those who have slept at leisure at home for too long ought now
to stand with goodwill or else refrain from sleeping. Let no
slaves occupy seats so that the free may have a place, or let
them pay money for their freedom. If they can’t do this, let<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>
them go home and avoid a double thrashing, so that they won’t
get checkered with rods here and with whips at home if they
haven’t done their chores when their masters return home. Let
the nurses attend to tiny babies at home and not bring them to
watch the play, so that the nurses themselves won’t be thirsty<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>
and the children won’t die from hunger or disturb us by wailing
here like little goats because of their hunger. Let the married
women watch quietly and laugh quietly, let them refrain from
tinkling with their ringing voices, and let them take their chattering
conversations home, so that they won’t be a nuisance to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span>
their husbands here as well as at home. And as for the organizers
of the games, let the palm not be given to any artist
unfairly and let them not be thrown out so that others benefit
from corruption and so that the worse can be placed ahead
of the good. And this, too, which I almost forgot: while the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">40</span><span class="br"></span>
games are taking place, footmen, storm the eating house; attack
now while you have the opportunity, now while the cheese
tarts<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_23_6" id="target_note_LCL260_23_6"><sup>6</sup></a> are hot! It is proper that everyone should remember for
himself these orders issued by virtue of the actor’s authority.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span>
Now in turn I wish to come back to the plot summary so that
you may be as knowledgeable as me. I shall now determine its
spaces, boundaries, and surroundings; for this I’ve been made
