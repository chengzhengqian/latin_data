audience will have understood these Punic passages. This is
why I have left them untranslated in the English version of the
play. But since the Punic in the <span class="italic">Poenulus</span> is real Punic and not
gibberish invented in order to make the audience laugh, the
passages deserve comment and translation. However, two caveats
have to be made from the outset. First, even though
Punic is a language that is understood reasonably well, there
remain certain gaps in our knowledge, partly concerning morphosyntax
and partly concerning the lexicon. Second, the text
transmitted in the manuscripts is corrupt. Naturally, mistakes
occur when texts are copied, and such mistakes increase greatly
in number when the copyists do not understand the language.
But while correcting mistakes in a Latin text is often relatively
straightforward, the situation is more complicated when the
language concerned is not fully understood and, to make matters
worse, cannot be rendered satisfactorily in the Latin alphabet.
Because of this, I will from time to time juxtapose different
solutions in my commentary or forgo a translation altogether.
In fact, I believe that apart from making the Punic passages
accessible to those who are not specialists in Semitic, my main
contribution here is to draw a distinction between what is certain,
what is plausible but not proven, and what cannot be explained
at all.</p>

language, Punic belongs to
the Semitic language family; this was already recognized at
the end of the sixteenth century, when Joseph Justus Scaliger
stated that the speech of the Carthaginian Hanno differs little
