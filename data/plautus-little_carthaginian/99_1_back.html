<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> Milphio has said that Hanno probably thinks that
they are medical doctors. Agorastocles has told Milphio to
tell Hanno that they are not. Milphio has just tried to get
Hanno’s attention when Hanno gives this reply. The first
word is certain. It is a present participle of the root RP’,
“heal.” Both the verb and its participle, meaning “doctor,
physician,” are attested in Punic. The rest of the line is
doubtful. Sznycer treats <span class="italic">ynny</span> as if it were Hebrew ’YN-
NW;
’YN is a Hebrew noun functioning as negation for declarative
clauses, here followed by an enclitic first-person
plural pronoun. If he is correct, the phrase means “for us
there is no physician” or “we do not have a physician.”
However, in Punic inscriptions this negation is not attested,
and others are used instead. <span class="italic">Cho</span> corresponds straightforwardly
to the well-attested
KH, “here.” <span class="italic">Is</span> could be ’Š,
“man,” and <span class="italic">tam</span> could conceivably belong to the root TM,
“perfect, good,” which is attested in Hebrew but not in Punic.
If one accepts the somewhat doubtful interpretations
of <span class="italic">ynny</span> and <span class="italic">tam</span>, the sentence means “we do not have a
doctor here, good man.” The address as “good man” is
ironic, just as its Latin equivalent, <span class="italic">bone uir</span>, would be—by
now Hanno has realized that Milphio is an incompetent
good-for-
nothing.</p>
