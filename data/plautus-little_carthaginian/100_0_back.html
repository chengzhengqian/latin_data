meaning (of your speech),” indicating that he is upset at
being spoken to rudely. Question words are not attested in
Punic inscriptions, but Hebrew has MH, “what.” The verbal
root PRŠ, “explain,” is attested in both Punic and Hebrew,
and the noun PRŠH, “meaning,” occurs in Hebrew.
After Hanno’s words, Agorastocles asks Milphio what was
meant, and Hanno says <span class="italic">mi uulech ianna. Mi</span> probably corresponds
to Hebrew MY, “who,” and we already saw <span class="italic">uulech</span>
above (l. 934); it stands for H-HLK,
“the guest-friend,
stranger” (article + noun). <span class="italic">Ianna</span> could belong to the root
‘NH, “ask,” in which case it is the third-person
singular
masculine imperfect qal Y‘NH. The whole sentence then
means: “Who will reply to the stranger?”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> The first word is certain, the rest less so. Milphio’s
interpretation is simply based on what sounds similar
in Latin and does not help us any further. <span class="italic">Lech</span> is the masculine
singular imperative of the well-attested
verb HLK,
“go.” <span class="italic">Lachanna</span>(<span class="italic">ni</span>) recurs in l. 1152 and from its use there
could possibly be an insult; Schröder interprets it as the
preposition L, “to,” and a noun KNN, “cross,” from the
Hebrew root KNN, “set up.” This would correspond to the
common Latin phrase <span class="italic">i in crucem</span>, “go to the cross.” But
neither the noun nor the verb is attested in Punic, and Hebrew
has the verb but not the noun. So this has to remain
highly dubious. An alternative, perhaps more likely interpretation
