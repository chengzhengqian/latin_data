<p>“Gods, your protection!”</p>
<p><span class="italic">Discussion</span>: Literally the Punic means “in the care which (is)
for you, gods, and in your protection.” The double <span class="italic">l</span> in <span class="italic">sy
llohom</span> is unexplained but can perhaps reflect a geminate
pronunciation of the sound following the relative subordinator
(in Hebrew the consonant following the definite article
is also geminated). Sznycer, who restores
<span class="italic">mysyrthoho</span>&lt;<span class="italic">m</span>&gt;, believes that the suffix marks the third-person
masculine plural (-HM). However, the old -<span class="italic">hum</span> is
only preserved in Byblian, while Punic generally has -<span class="italic">om</span>
(or a new -<span class="italic">nom</span>), so that the preservation of the ending–<span class="italic">hum</span>/-<span class="italic">hom</span>
in the <span class="italic">Poenulus</span> would be highly unusual;
moreover, in the Punic in Plautus the Punic letter H is not
normally rendered by Latin <span class="italic">h</span> but left out entirely. A third
objection
against Sznycer’s interpretation is that the Latin
version has the second-person plural. The second-person
masculine plural suffix is -KM. This should be written–<span class="italic">chom</span> in Text 1.–<span class="italic">hom</span> either represents a velar fricative
