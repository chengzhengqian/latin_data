one is a greater perjurer or criminal anywhere on earth
than my master is, nor as dirty or smeared with excrement.
As truly as the gods may love me, I’d rather spend
my life tied to a heavy iron block in the quarries or the
mill than be a slave at this pimp’s. What breed is that, what<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">830</span><span class="br"></span>
corruptions of men happen there! Gods, your protection!
There you can see any type of man, as if you’d come
to the Underworld, whether you want a nobleman, ordinary
citizen, freedman, thief, or run-away,
a beaten one,
a bound one, a bond slave: a man who has something to
pay, whatever he’s like, all types are taken in. And so in
the whole house there’s darkness, hiding places, one 835
drinks and eats as in a tavern, no differently. There you
can see clay letters46 with inscriptions on them, signed
with pitch, and there are names on them in letters an ell
long: that’s the way we have a recruitment of wine vessels
in our house.</p></div>

eulogy for him when he’s dead. I’d love to approach him,
and yet I listen to him with great pleasure.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL260_105_46"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL260_105_46" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">46</sup>The amphoras.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL260_105_46').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
