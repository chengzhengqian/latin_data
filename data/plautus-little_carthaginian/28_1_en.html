lovesick man, who rushes everything he does. For instance,
I’m bringing along these advocates, the most
slow-moving of men, slower than freight ships are on a
calm sea. And I deliberately avoided my elderly friends:
I knew they’d be slower because of their age, and I
feared delay for my love. But I’ve gained no advantage<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">510</span><span class="br"></span>
by choosing these attendants for myself, leaden-footed,
very slow ones. (<span class="italic">to the advocates</span>) If you’re going today,
go, or go and be hanged! Should friends walk like this in
