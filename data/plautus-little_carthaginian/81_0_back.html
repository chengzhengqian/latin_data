mostly onomastic material; for instance, funerary inscriptions

<p class="noindent">The Phoenicians were a seafaring nation and founded colonies
throughout the Mediterranean. Linguistically the most
important of these new foundations was Carthage, a city in
what is now Tunisia. The dialect of Carthage, at first difficult
to distinguish from other forms of Phoenician because of the
conservative nature of orthography and writing conventions in
general, developed in its own way and is referred to as Punic.
Punic continued to be spoken in North Africa long after the
language of the homeland had died out and even after Carthage
was destroyed in 146 BC. Saint Augustine (AD 354–430)
mentioned that it was still spoken by a large number of people
in his day (<span class="italic">epist</span>. 17. 2).</p>

<p>The Phoenician script<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_176_4" id="target_note_LCL260_176_4"><sup>4</sup></a> only marks sounds that can stand at the
beginning of a word or a syllable; since in Phoenician words
and syllables cannot begin with vowels, the Phoenician script
contains only consonants. In this respect it is no different from
the old Hebrew and Aramaic scripts. Phoenician has twenty-two
consonant signs, and these seem to correspond closely to
the consonantal phonemes of the language:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_176_5a" id="target_note_LCL260_176_5a"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
