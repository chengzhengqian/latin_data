Cockney pronunciation of <span class="italic">better</span> as [beʔə] or in Arabic’. In
Hebrew the voiced and voiceless stops had fricative variants.
Whether this was also the case for Phoenician and Punic is
uncertain. Many scholars believe that no such variants existed,
but assume that <span class="italic">p</span> turned into <span class="italic">f</span> in all instances. The Plautine
text provides conflicting
evidence. On the one hand there are
spellings with <span class="italic">ph</span> and <span class="italic">f</span>; the former could stand for an aspirated
stop, <span class="italic">p</span><sup>h</sup>, or a fricative, <span class="italic">f</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_178_6" id="target_note_LCL260_178_6"><sup>6</sup></a> while the latter has to be a fricative
unless a copyist unfamiliar with Punic routinely changed the
spelling <span class="italic">ph</span> to <span class="italic">f.</span> But on the other hand, Milphio’s misunderstandings
of Punic <span class="italic">palu</span> (l. 1017) and <span class="italic">phonnim</span> (l. 1023) as <span class="italic">palas</span>,
“spades,” and <span class="italic">supponi/imponi</span>, “place under/place on,” indicate
that Plautus had a plosive pronunciation in mind, that is,
<span class="italic">p</span> or <span class="italic">p</span><sup>h</sup> for both spellings <span class="italic">p</span> and <span class="italic">ph.</span></p>
<p>Among the fricatives, <span class="italic">ṣ</span> is emphatic (phonetic symbol [s<sup>ʕ</sup>])
and <span class="italic">š</span> is palato-alveolar, like the first sound in English <span class="italic">shine.</span>
There are two pharyngeal fricatives with no counterpart in
English: <span class="italic">ḥ</span> is voiceless (phonetic symbol [ħ]) and ‘is voiced
(phonetic symbol [ʕ]). Close equivalents can be found in Arabic.</p>
<p>Languages change, and Punic is no exception. At least some
varieties of Punic gradually merged the emphatic stops with
their nonemphatic counterparts. Similarly, the various sibilants
are often confused in late Punic epigraphy, indicating a partial
or complete merger of <span class="italic">s, z, ṣ,</span> and <span class="italic">š.</span> Late inscriptions in the
Phoenician alphabet also show confusion between the letters
originally indicating laryngeal and pharyngeal sounds, for instance
‘and’; this points to further mergers or loss of these
