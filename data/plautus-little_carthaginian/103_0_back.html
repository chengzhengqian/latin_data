than that. The first words are clear because they correspond
closely to what the son had said to his mother. We
find the wish <span class="italic">auo</span>, “may he live,” and the relative clause
“who is mine.” <span class="italic">Bane</span> (<span class="italic">bene</span> looks like a Latinization, since
in Latin <span class="italic">bene</span> means “well”) is probably BN-Y,
the word for “son” with an enclitic first-person
singular pronoun. The whole phrase means “may my son, who is mine, live,” in
other words, “greetings to my son.” The rest is incomprehensible.
Krahmalkov believes that we are dealing with a
Punic translation of a passage from the <span class="italic">Aulularia</span> and renders
it as “let us drink wine; let us drink the blood of the
vine!—No! I shall drink water!” This is rather far-fetched.</p>

above in l. 1013. He is clearly frustrated and feels deflated
after his attempts at Punic have been shown to be useless.
Now he has to take Hanno’s Punic servants into the house
and says <span class="italic">lachanna</span> to them, which is either an insult or the
imperative of HLK, “go,” with the adhortative particle N’.
If it is the latter, Milphio clearly does not understand the
grammar: <span class="italic">lech</span> is the imperative masculine singular, but he
is addressing several people.</p>
