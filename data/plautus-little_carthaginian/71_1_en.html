mina I gave to the pimp, then the men about town can
indeed poke fun at me. He even invited me in for lunch,
the big crook, went out himself, and left me as majordomo
in the house. When neither pimp nor girls returned
and I wasn’t
given anything to eat, I took security<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1285</span><span class="br"></span>
for the larger part of the lunch and left. That’s how I’ll
do it: I’ll make the little pimp pay his army tax. He’s
found the right man to cheat out of a silver mina! But
now that I’m angry I’d like my girlfriend to meet me:
with my fists I’ll make sure that she’s black as a blackbird
this instant, I’ll fill her with blackness to such an extent<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1290</span><span class="br"></span>
that she’s much blacker than the Egyptians who carry the
