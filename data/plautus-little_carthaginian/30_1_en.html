<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ago</span><p class="lineGroup">Please, give me speedboat help, not cargo-ship help; at least stir yourselves: I don’t expect you to hurry.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">advo</span><p class="lineGroup">If you want to do something gently and leisurely, we’ll<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">545</span><span class="br"></span>
help you. If you’re in a hurry, you’d better take runners
as advocates.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ago</span><p class="lineGroup">You know the situation, I’ve told you what I need your
help for, about the pimp here, who has been tricking me,
the lover, for so long, so that a trap has been prepared
for him concerning my gold and my slave.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">advo</span><p class="lineGroup">We know all those things already, if these spectators<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">550</span><span class="br"></span>
know them. This play is now being staged here for the
sake of these spectators; it’s better for you to teach them,
so that they know what you’re doing when you’re doing
it. Don’t bother about us: we know the entire business,
since we all learned it together with you, so that we could
answer you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ago</span><p class="lineGroup">That’s indeed how it is. But go on then, so that I may<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">555</span><span class="br"></span>
know that you know the business, explain and tell me
what I told you a while ago.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">advo</span><p class="lineGroup">Really? You’re testing if we know it? Didn’t
you think
we’d remember how you gave your overseer Collybiscus
three hundred Philippics, which he was to bring here to
the pimp, your enemy, and that he should pretend to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">560</span><span class="br"></span>
be a stranger from somewhere else, from another city?
When he has brought it, you are to arrive there looking
for your slave and your money.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ago</span><p class="lineGroup">You remember it memorably, you’ve saved me.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
