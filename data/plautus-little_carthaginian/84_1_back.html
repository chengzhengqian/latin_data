begin with. Finally, there are no special letters for the emphatic
stops <span class="italic">ṭ</span> and <span class="italic">q</span>. Here, however, the texts in the new orthography
do make a distinction
that Text 2 did not make. Text 2 uses the
letter <span class="italic">t</span> for both <span class="italic">t</span> and <span class="italic">ṭ</span>, and <span class="italic">c</span> for both <span class="italic">k</span> and <span class="italic">q.</span> The modern
texts, on the other hand, quite consistently use <span class="italic">th</span> and <span class="italic">ch</span> for
the nonemphatic
stops and <span class="italic">t</span> and <span class="italic">c</span> for the emphatic ones.</p>
<p>Another major difficulty
is word division. Punic inscriptions
sometimes, but not always, contain word dividers. The Punic
texts in the Ambrosian palimpsest have no indications of word
division, just like the Latin ones. In the Palatine manuscripts,
where Latin words are separated by spaces, the Punic text also
contains spaces, but these were introduced late and are unreliable
as indications of word division. This means that we can
separate words reliably only when we recognize letter sequences
through our knowledge of Phoenician and Punic.</p>
<p>Gratwick (1969), in an overly harsh review of Sznycer
(1967), argues that several types of words ought to be distinguished
in our Punic passages:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Strings of letters occurring more than once in the Punic
and having the same translational equivalent in the Latin;
these words are certain, especially if they recur in Punic
inscriptions in the Greek or Latin alphabet.</li>
<li>(b) Strings of letters which have no translational equivalents
in the Latin (like <span class="italic">anech</span>, “I”) but which are attested
in inscriptions in the Greek or Latin alphabet; such words
can often be explained plausibly.</li>
<li>(c) Everything else; here the interpretation depends on often
arbitrary word division of the Punic text in Plautus
and on identification
of the resulting chunks with Punic
and other Semitic roots.</li>
</ul>
