<p><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> This line contains several elements that we already
saw in l. 937. <span class="italic">Anec</span> is the first-person
singular pronoun
’NK(Y), “I.” The form <span class="italic">nasot</span>, which enabled us to correct
<span class="italic">naso</span> from l. 937, is the first-person
singular perfect
NŠ’TY, from the root NŠ’, “bring.” <span class="italic">Ers ahelicot</span> also corresponds
to a phrase from l. 937, ḤRŠ H-HLKT,
“shard of
hospitality.” The beginning of the line is less clear. The
Ambrosian palimpsest has <span class="italic">sittesed</span>, while the Palatine manuscripts
have <span class="italic">ette se.</span> If we take <span class="italic">ette</span> as the correct reading,
it could be ’T-’
and mean “to him” (preposition with enclitic
third-person
masculine singular pronoun). <span class="italic">Sed</span> or <span class="italic">se</span>
remains difficult.
A relative particle, ’Š, makes little syntactic
sense here, and the demonstrative ST, which in l. 937
modifies the shard of hospitality, can hardly be separated
from this noun phrase. The elements which are reasonably
clear can be translated thus: “to him I have brought the
shard of hospitality.”</p>

<p><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> This line is essentially unclear. <span class="italic">Alem</span> could be
‘LM, “young man,” as in l. 944, if one accepts the word
there, or “about him,” which is the alternative interpretation
in l. 944. We can then divide <span class="italic">us duberti</span> or <span class="italic">us duber.</span>
In the first case <span class="italic">us</span> could be the relative particle ’Š and <span class="italic">duberti</span>
the first-person
singular perfect pi‘el of DBR,
“speak,” DBRTY, yielding the meaning “the young man of
whom I have spoken.” In the second case we would have
