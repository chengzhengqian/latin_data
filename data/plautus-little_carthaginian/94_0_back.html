<p class="centered"><span class="italic">General Remarks</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Text 2 (ll. 940–49) is found in the Ambrosian palimpsest as well
as in the Palatine manuscripts. It is corrupt in all branches of
the transmission, but especially so in the Palatine manuscripts,
where the passage has been compressed into eight lines and in
addition heavily Latinized. Latinization can, for example, be
seen in l. 941, where the Palatine manuscripts contain the Latin
word <span class="italic">concubitum</span> instead of a phonetically similar Punic word,
or in l. 946, where they have the Latin <span class="italic">at enim.</span> For this reason
I have mainly relied on the palimpsest, listing the variants in
the Palatine manuscripts underneath. As much of the text remains
obscure, I have not attempted to translate everything.
Instead, I discuss underneath each line what can and what cannot
be understood.</p>
