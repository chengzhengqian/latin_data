coming out from here”</p>
<p><span class="italic">Latin l. 960:</span> hos percontabor qui hinc egrediuntur foras
“I’ll ask these people who are coming out”</p>
<p><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> The first half of the line has no equivalent in the
Latin, which makes it more difficult
to handle. The noun
‘D, “duration” (Hebrew ‘WD), can have adverbial functions,
especially when preceded by the preposition B. Here
the noun is combined with a suffixed pronoun, a construction
that is rather common in Hebrew. <span class="italic">Aly thera</span> is problematic.
Sznycer thinks of the preposition ‘LY, “on,” which
in Hebrew is the poetic equivalent of ‘L. However, Punic
only has ‘L and ‘LT. It is possible that we are dealing with
haplography and that <span class="italic">alyth thera</span> became <span class="italic">aly thera</span> in the
process
of copying. <span class="italic">Thera</span> is difficult
to explain. Hebrew
has a verb R’H, “see,” which is not attested in Punic.
Sznycer assumes that <span class="italic">thera</span> is a <span class="italic">t</span>-derivative
of this verb,
but no such derivative is attested in Punic or in Hebrew,
which actually
has an <span class="italic">m</span>-derivative.
Consequently, this interpretation
has to be discarded. A connection with the
Hebrew noun TR’, “appearance,” seems equally unlikely.
Krahmalkov’s explanation does not convince me in the
form he states it. He divides <span class="italic">a lyther</span> and takes <span class="italic">a</span> as an abbreviation
of <span class="italic">anech</span>, “I,” while <span class="italic">lyther</span> is the preposition L
with the construct infinitive TWR, “watch.” While the second
part of his explanation can be defended, it is hard to
believe in the existence of abbreviations in this text, since
Roman actors would not have known what they stood for. I
have hesitatingly accepted Krahmalkov’s L-TWR
