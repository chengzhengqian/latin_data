want anything to be taken care of, then unless someone gives
me money he’ll behave like a fool; but the man who does give
me money will behave like an even bigger fool. But this chap’s
Carthaginian uncle, who is alive, but old, had two daughters, one<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">85</span><span class="br"></span>
five years old, the other four; they disappeared from Magara<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_27_7" id="target_note_LCL260_27_7"><sup>7</sup></a>
together with their nurse. The man who kidnapped them brings
them to Anactorium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_27_8" id="target_note_LCL260_27_8"><sup>8</sup></a> and sells them all for cash, the nurse and
the girls, to the most detestable human being—if a pimp<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">90</span><span class="br"></span>
counts as a human being—whom the earth sustains. As for the
rest, you can now guess for yourselves what sort of creature it
is that has the name Lycus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_27_9" id="target_note_LCL260_27_9"><sup>9</sup></a> Not long ago he moved from
Anactorium, where he had lived before, here to Calydon, to ply<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">95</span><span class="br"></span>
his trade. He lives in that house. (<span class="italic">points to it</span>) This young chap
is madly in love with one of the girls, his own relative, completely
unaware of this fact; he doesn’t know who she is and
he’s never touched her: that’s how the pimp wears him out. He
hasn’t had any intercourse with her yet and he’s never hired her,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">100</span><span class="br"></span>
nor would the pimp send her to him. Because he can see that
he is in love, he wants to catch him with a throw of the net. A
certain soldier, who is passionately in love with that younger
one, wants to buy her to become his concubine. But ever since
their Carthaginian father lost them, he’s been looking for them<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">105</span><span class="br"></span>
everywhere by sea and by land. Whenever he enters a city, he
immediately finds out where all the prostitutes live. He pays
money, hires her for a night, and then asks where she’s from
