and the Palatine manuscripts by and large have
the same text, which receives further confirmation
from
Milphio’s interpretation based on Latin words that sound
similar: <span class="italic">palas</span>, “spades,” and <span class="italic">mergas</span>, “reaping boards.” The
interpretation of the Punic is relatively certain. It consists
of two nominal clauses. The first has <span class="italic">umer</span> as its subject,
which corresponds to ’MR, “word, speech,” attested in inscriptions.
The predicate <span class="italic">palu</span> is a noun which does not occur
in inscriptions but corresponds to Hebrew PL’, “wonder,
marvel.” Hanno is thus mocking Milphio’s attempts at
translating, saying that his speech is wonderful or strange.
The second sentence has <span class="italic">etha</span> as subject, which occurs as
’T in inscriptions and is the second-person
masculine singular
pronoun “you.” <span class="italic">Gad</span> is less certain. Gray takes it as
the form GD’ found in inscriptions, which means “goat,”
and interprets the sentence as an insult: “you are a goat,”
i.e., “you are an idiot.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> Spelling and pronunciation of Hanno’s words are
secured by Milphio’s nonsensical but phonologically helpful
Latin interpretation. Milphio’s <span class="italic">supponi</span>, “place under,”
and <span class="italic">imponi</span>, “place on,” correspond to the Punic <span class="italic">phonnim</span>,
and <span class="italic">sub cratim</span>, “underneath a wickerwork basket,” fit well
with <span class="italic">si corathi</span> or <span class="italic">si corathim</span>; since final -m
in Latin had
lost its consonantal value in most contexts and was only
rendered as nasalization of the preceding vowel, not too
much should be made of the final -<span class="italic">m</span>
of <span class="italic">corathim</span> transmitted
