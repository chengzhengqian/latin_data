<p><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> In the Latin version and in Text 1 we are told in
this line that Antidamas has died. Both versions use the euphemism
of doing what one has to do. This is in fact the
only part that is clear in this line. The last part, <span class="italic">luful</span>, corresponds
to <span class="italic">liful</span> in l. 935, which can be analyzed as L-P‘L,
“to do” (preposition L, “for,” + construct infinitive P‘L,
“do”).</p>

<p><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> The last word, despite textual corruption in all
manuscripts, clearly renders Agaristoclem (accusative). Before
that we seem to have <span class="italic">hu</span>, which is H’, “he.” The string
<span class="italic">uos duber</span> has a corresponding element in l. 936 (“one
says”). Since this line seems to correspond to l. 936 quite
well, one would also expect a statement to the effect that
Agorastocles is “his [i.e., Antidamas’] son”; perhaps the sequence
<span class="italic">tanim</span> should be emended to <span class="italic">banim</span> (BN-M), “his
son.”</p>
