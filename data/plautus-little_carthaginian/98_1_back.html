<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> Hanno is greeting Agorastocles. Milphio correctly
interprets <span class="italic">auo</span> as greeting, but because he does not know
any Punic, he regards <span class="italic">donni</span> as equivalent to Latin <span class="italic">doni</span>,
“gift, present” (genitive singular). However, <span class="italic">donni</span> stands
for ’DN-Y;
the first element means “lord, master” and the
second is the enclitic first-person

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> In the Palatine manuscripts the spelling <span class="italic">h</span> in the
first word probably stands for <span class="italic">ch</span> (Punic letter K), either
because of a fricative pronunciation or because of textual
corruption; the Latin rendition of Punic very rarely uses <span class="italic">h</span>
on its own. The confusion between the letters <span class="italic">H</span> and <span class="italic">K</span> is
