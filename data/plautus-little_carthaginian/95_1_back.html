<p><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> The only word that is absolutely certain in this
line is Antidamas (<span class="italic">antidamos</span> in <span class="italic">A</span>). Sznycer interprets <span class="italic">esse</span>
as ’Š, “man,” followed by the relative particle ’Š. In <span class="italic">duber</span>
we probably have a form of the common verb DBR, “say,”
perhaps a masculine singular participle (Hebrew <span class="italic">dōbēr</span>). If
Friedrich, Röllig, Amadasi Guzzo, and Mayer are right in
saying that ’Š, “man,” + participle can also be used impersonally
(“one does”), <span class="italic">esse</span> . . . <span class="italic">duber</span> could simply mean
“one says” (’Š DBR). <span class="italic">Alem</span> could conceivably be ‘LM,
“young man,” a noun attested in Hebrew but not in Punic,
which, however, has the derivative ‘LMT, “young woman,”
which presupposes the existence of ‘LM in Punic as well.
Alternatively, <span class="italic">alem</span> could be the preposition ‘L, “above,
about,” with the enclitic third-person
masculine singular
pronoun -M;
in that case, however, the word order would
be somewhat strange. Thus we can translate: “one says
young Antidamas . . .” or “one says Antidamas . . . about
him . . .” The rest defies interpretation.</p>
