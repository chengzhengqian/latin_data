from Hebrew. Nowadays the Semitic language family is typically
subdivided into two major groups:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_175_2" id="target_note_LCL260_175_2"><sup>2</sup></a> on the one hand there
is East Semitic, comprising Akkadian and Eblaite, and on the
other hand there is West Semitic, comprising all other Semitic
languages. West Semitic is in turn divided into South Semitic,
with languages like Ge‘ez, the language of Ethiopian liturgy,
and Central Semitic.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_175_3" id="target_note_LCL260_175_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Central Semitic comprises Arabic on the
one hand and Northwest Semitic on the other. Northwest Semitic
contains three major branches: Ugaritic, Aramaic, and
Canaanite. The Canaanite languages are all very closely related;
they are Hebrew, Phoenician, Moabite, Edomite, Ammonite,
and the language of the letters of El Amarna (Akkadian
with strong Canaanite influence).
Punic is a later form of Phoenician.
Since Hebrew is the language of the Canaanite group
that is best understood, scholars trying to explain obscure elements
of Punic normally have recourse to Hebrew.</p>
<p>The Phoenician homeland is the coastal area of southern
Syria and northern Palestine. The oldest Phoenician texts date
from around 1100 BC, the latest from the first century BC.
Phoenician is mainly known from inscriptions; nothing of the
rich Phoenician literature mentioned by Greek and Roman
writers has come down to us. Although several thousand inscriptions
have been found, our knowledge of the language is
still limited because many of the texts are formulaic or contain
