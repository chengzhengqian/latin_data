but not entirely in senarii; they assume a structure that consists
of varying iambic meters like the senarius, the septenarius, and
so on. While this attempt is more successful, it still requires
violating Latin scansion rules and ignoring what little we know
of Punic syllable structure; in addition, if the passage were in
mixed iambics, it would presumably be a Plautine song, which
seems rather unlikely. Thus it seems best to treat Text 1 and
Text 2 as prose. Glück and Maurach are of course right in saying
that prose in a Plautine comedy is an anomaly, but so is the
insertion of a lengthy passage in a foreign language.</p>

(ll. 950–60, without l. 954). This makes it relatively easy to
understand the Punic: where the meaning is uncertain, we
know what words to look for and how to reconstitute the original
Punic text. The spelling conventions going back to the
Varronian era or later also help with this to some extent.</p>
<p>Text 1 is found only in the Palatine manuscripts. As <span class="italic">B</span> is
generally the most reliable Palatine manuscript, I have by and

its readings, except that I do not follow the haphazard
word separation there. Important textual variants, but
not for instance variations between <span class="italic">y, i</span>, and <span class="italic">u</span>, are listed immediately
underneath each line; the readings of the Codex
Turnebi (see Lindsay 1898) are indicated only where substantially
different. This is followed by a Romanized version

what the text in the Punic script would have looked like; the
