<p class="noindent">The short passages after Hanno’s entrance monologue are
transmitted in all manuscripts. Some of them are “translated”
by Milphio, who obviously knows no more than one or two
words of Punic and simply uses Latin words that sound similar
to the Punic ones. Nevertheless, in some cases the context
helps us to understand what is being said. However, in the
absence of a Latin translation as we had it for Text 1, much of
the meaning remains uncertain. I list textual variants underneath
each short passage and discuss the meaning in some
detail, without trying to translate everything.</p>

<p class="centered">l. 994: auo.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> Agorastocles has asked his slave Milphio to approach
and address Hanno in Punic. <span class="italic">Auo</span> is the only Punic
word Milphio manages. It is a greeting from the verbal
root ḤWY, “live.” The masculine singular imperative <span class="italic">ḥauē,</span>
“live,” was borrowed into Latin as the greeting <span class="italic">aue</span>, from
which a Latin plural form, <span class="italic">auete</span>, could be formed. Here
the vocalism shows that we cannot be dealing with the imperative.
Presumably <span class="italic">auo</span> is the third-person
masculine singular
perfect qal used as a wish, “may he live.” If so,
Hanno is addressed in the third person, which is not unusual.</p>
