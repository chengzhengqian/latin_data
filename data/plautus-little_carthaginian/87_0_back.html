relative clause in l. 930 contains no verb at all and the predicate
is a locative expression (“who this place” = “who are in this
place”).</p>
<p>Proto-Semitic still had a three-case system, but these cases
no longer exist in Punic. The subject is left unmarked. The
direct object can also be unmarked, but often it is preceded by
the preposition ’T (written <span class="italic">yth</span> in the <span class="italic">Poenulus</span>), whose only
function is to indicate that the following constituent
is the direct
object.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_188_11" id="target_note_LCL260_188_11"><sup>11</sup></a> Other syntactic roles are mostly marked by a
number of different prepositions.</p>
<p>Relative clauses in Latin are always introduced by relative
pronouns indicating the gender and number of their head
nouns as well as the syntactic functions they have in the subordinate
clauses. English
relative pronouns are similar: in <span class="italic">the
man whom I saw</span>, the pronoun <span class="italic">whom</span> shows that the head
noun, <span class="italic">man</span>, is human and has object function in the subordinate
clause. However, English
can also introduce relative clauses
with the subordinator <span class="italic">that</span>, a subordinator which leaves all this
information unspecified.
Punic follows the second
strategy; its
relative particle ’Š only indicates that a relative
clause begins,
but leaves gender, number, and semantic function of the head
noun in the relative clause unclear.</p>
<p>Not much else needs to be said about Punic syntax here,
except that Hanno’s entrance monologue may well be influenced
by Latin structures to some extent. In l. 958, for instance,
we find the Latin phrase <span class="italic">hospitalem . . . tesseram</span>, “guest’s
shard,” and Hanno’s phrase <span class="italic">chirs aelichot</span>, “shard of hospitality”
(l. 937), seems to be an imitation of this phrase.</p>
