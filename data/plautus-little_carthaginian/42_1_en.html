at your place.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lyc</span><p class="lineGroup">At my place? You’ll never find that this has happened.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ago</span><p class="lineGroup">You’re lying: he came to you and brought you gold. This

with witnesses to try and catch me. No one and nothing

Sparta for me now have an itch in their brains about me
making a profit

sent him to say that his slave is at my place with gold. A
trick has been set up in order to deprive me of it and to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">775</span><span class="br"></span>
divide it among themselves. They expect to snatch away
the lamb from the wolf. They’re wasting their time.</p></div>

who we told you was from Sparta and who just now
brought three hundred Philippics to you. And what’s
