<p>“look, to him I have brought this shard of hospitality”</p>

<p><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> The presentative particle <span class="italic">hy</span> (normally “there is,”
here rendered as “look”) is odd in the middle of the sentence
and has no equivalent in the Latin. Perhaps it is a
dittography because of the preceding <span class="italic">anethi/anechi</span> and
should be deleted. The correction of <span class="italic">naso</span> to <span class="italic">nasot</span> by Benary
is based on the corresponding form in l. 947; in the
orthography of Text 1, this should actually
be <span class="italic">nasothi.</span></p>
