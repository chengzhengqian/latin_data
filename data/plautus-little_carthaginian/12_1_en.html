smooth, polish, paint ourselves, and do up our hair; and
with us we had two slave girls each that we were given—they took care of washing and bathing us; and from
bringing us water two men got exhausted. Away with the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">225</span><span class="br"></span>
amount of trouble that’s in a single woman! But two,
I know that well enough, can keep any one enormous
people you please busy; night and day at all times they
always make themselves up, wash, dry, and polish themselves.

same way as salted fish is said to be too salty, without any
attraction and without sweetness; unless they’re soaked
with a lot of water throughout and for a long time, they
stink, they’re too salty, so that you don’t
want to touch
them. We are like that, women
are of that stock, quite<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">245</span><span class="br"></span>
