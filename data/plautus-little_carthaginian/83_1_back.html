Greek only after Plautus, who presumably used <span class="italic">u</span>, <span class="italic">p</span>, <span class="italic">t</span>, and <span class="italic">c</span>
instead. All Plautine manuscripts use <span class="italic">y</span> and the digraphs in
Greek words, which shows that the Plautus text was modernized
orthographically, presumably in the first century BC or
later. While we could in theory regard Text 1 as an old text
which was orthographically updated, in practice this is highly
unlikely. The reason is that Text 2, which is transmitted in the
Ambrosian palimpsest as well as the Palatine manuscripts, follows
more archaic spelling conventions and has not been updated
orthographically, except in the first line (l. 940), where
we find <span class="italic">y</span> and the digraph <span class="italic">th.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_181_9" id="target_note_LCL260_181_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Text 2 therefore seems to be the original text inserted by
Plautus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_181_10" id="target_note_LCL260_181_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Whether he took it from the Greek original of the
play or commissioned a Latin-Punic bilingual to compose it for
him remains unclear. As will be seen below, Text 2 is by and
large unintelligible. Insofar as we can tell today, it does not
correspond very closely to the Latin version. If Text 2 suffered
substantial corruption already shortly after Plautus’ lifetime, as
is quite likely because the copyists will not have understood it,
this corruption may well be the reason for the creation of Text
1. On this assumption, Text 1 and possibly the Latin translation,
which seems to correspond closely to Text 1, could be the work
of a scholar of the Varronian era or later, when the new orthography
was the norm. Text 1 would have been created as a substitute
for the barely intelligible Text 2.</p>

Gray (1923), the latter, however, for different reasons; Gray argues that
Text 1 is less idiomatic Semitic and must have been written later. Interestingly,
Sznycer (1967: 131–32) comes to the opposite conclusion
by looking at the Punic from a linguistic angle. Clearly, in a less well-known
language it is best to rely on external criteria like orthography.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL260_181_10').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
