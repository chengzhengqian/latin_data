land surveyor. But if you don’t object, I want to give you the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span>
name of the comedy; if it does annoy you, I’ll still say it, if indeed
I’m allowed to by those in whose hands this is. This comedy
is called <span class="italic">Karchedonios</span>; in Latin uncle porridge-eater Plautus
***. You already have the name. Now receive the remaining<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">55</span><span class="br"></span>
declarations; for this plot summary will be examined as a declaration
of property. The plot summary has as place where it’s
examined its own space in front of the stage: you are the officials
who receive sworn declarations. Please pay attention.
There were two first cousins from Carthage, from a very great<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">60</span><span class="br"></span>
family and with very great riches. One of them is alive, the
other is dead. I’m stating this before you so confidently for the
simple reason that the undertaker who prepared him for burial
told me so himself. But as for that old man who died, the
only son he had is kidnapped from his wealth and from his father<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">65</span><span class="br"></span>
from Carthage as a seven-year-old boy, six years before his
father dies; when he sees that his only son was lost, he himself
falls ill from grief. He makes that cousin of his his heir and he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">70</span><span class="br"></span>
himself goes to the Underworld without any travel provisions.
The one who kidnapped the boy takes him away to Calydon and
sells him to a certain rich old master here who wants to have
children but hates women. Without knowing it, this old man,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">75</span><span class="br"></span>
in buying that boy, buys the son of his family friend, adopts him
as his son, and makes him his heir when he himself dies. This
young man lives there, in that house. (<span class="italic">points to it</span>) I’m returning
to Carthage again. If you want to entrust anything to me or<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span>
