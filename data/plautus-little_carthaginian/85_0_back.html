<p class="noindent">Gratwick considers all words in category (c) as doubtful. I do
not take such an <span class="italic">a priori</span> negative view. For Text 1 we have a
Latin translation, so word division and identification
of the
resulting elements with Punic roots is not a doomed undertaking,
even though some uncertainties remain. In principle,
the Latin translation should also help us with Text 2, but this
text is too corrupt to allow much analysis. With regard to the
short Punic pieces later in the play, I by and large share Gratwick’s
skepticism for words in category (c).</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Punic Morphology and Syntax</span></span>
<p class="noindent">The morphology and syntax of the Canaanite languages differ
from Latin and Indo-European
in many respects. Here is not
the place to discuss Punic grammar in detail. Readers interested
in the subject should consult Harris (1936) as basic introduction,
Segert (1976) as more advanced reading, and Friedrich,
Röllig, Amadasi Guzzo, and Mayer (1999) as reference work.
Krahmalkov (2001) is also to be recommended,
even though
his analyses of the Punic passages in the <span class="italic">Poenulus</span> are idiosyncratic
in several respects (see Krahmalkov 1970 and 1988); far
more reliable in his analysis of our passages is Sznycer (1967).
As a dictionary
of Phoenician and Punic, Krahmalkov (2000) is
useful; for lexical parallels in Hebrew, the most convenient
work is Koehler and Baumgartner
(2004). My aim here is more
modest: I shall merely mention
those grammatical features the
reader will encounter in the Punic texts of the <span class="italic">Poenulus</span>.</p>
<p>Punic nouns inflect for number and gender. The numbers
Punic nouns can have are singular and plural, and to a very
limited extent dual, but the dual is not attested in our passages.
The plural and dual are marked by suffixes and to some extent
