<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mil</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">calling after him</span>) You’re creating a real opportunity for
me! (<span class="italic">to the audience</span>) He’s left. The immortal gods want
my master saved and this pimp ruined, to judge from
what great ruin is threatening him. Does a second missile
really threaten him already before the first one has been
shot? I’ll go inside in order to tell my master about this:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">920</span><span class="br"></span>
if I were to call him out in front of the house, it would
be stupidity if I were to repeat again the same things
here which you’ve just heard. I’d rather annoy one person
inside than all of you here. [Immortal gods, what
ruin and what destruction is coming to this pimp today!
But now is the time that I’m wasting my time. That’s<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">925</span><span class="br"></span>
how the business has been begun, there’s no room for
hesitation: what’s just been entrusted to me needs to be
planned cleverly,
and on the other hand that homegrown
plan needs to be looked after. If there were any delay, a
man who gave me a big thrashing would do so deservedly.
Now I’ll go inside; I’ll wait at home for my master
to come from the forum.]</p></div>
