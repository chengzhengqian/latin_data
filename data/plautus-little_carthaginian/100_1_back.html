is as a repeated imperative <span class="italic">lech</span> with the adhortative
particle N’, which occurs in Hebrew after imperatives.
<span class="italic">Limini</span> could be the double preposition L-MN,
“from,”
which is attested in inscriptions. <span class="italic">Chot</span> means “here” and is
related to the common KH in the same meaning. Thus
Hanno says to Milphio, with whom he is annoyed, “go away
from here!” He seems to add an insult or to double the imperative,

the third-person
singular masculine perfect qal of ’ŠM, “be
guilty,” a verb which is frequent in Hebrew but not actually
attested in Punic. On this interpretation, Hanno says to Agorastocles:
“he [i.e., Milphio] has become guilty.”</p>
