majuscule texts, which points to an earlier reading,
<span class="italic">mephar</span>; but as no root MPR is attested in Punic or Hebrew,
we should probably follow what the Palatine manuscripts
point to and read <span class="italic">mechar</span>. In the second word, the
reading of the Palatine manuscripts is to be preferred because
Milphio misinterprets Hanno’s sentence as containing
Latin <span class="italic">bucca</span>, “cheek.” The interpretation of the sentence
remains doubtful. The second word is slightly
clearer. It could consist of the preposition B, “for,” and the
enclitic second-person
singular masculine personal pronoun
-K
(as the comparative evidence shows, probably vocalized
-<span class="italic">kā</span>),
in which case it would mean “for you.”
<span class="italic">Mechar</span>, if the form is restored correctly, is more difficult.
Sznycer tentatively suggests MKR, “merchandise,” a word
attested in Hebrew but not in Punic. The fact that this
noun is not attested in Punic is not really problematic
because
MKR, “sell,” and its participle MKR, “salesman,” are
found in inscriptions. But the interpretation is probably to
be rejected because Hanno has not come to sell things.
Perhaps Sznycer’s second suggestion is to be preferred; he
compares Hebrew MKR, “acquaintance,” an <span class="italic">m</span>-noun
from
the verb NKR, “get to know.” However, neither the noun
nor the verb is attested in Punic. With this caveat in mind,
we can interpret the sentence as being addressed to Agorastocles,
whom Hanno asks about Milphio: “Is he an acquaintance
of yours?”</p>
