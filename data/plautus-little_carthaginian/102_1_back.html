<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> Hanno comments that one of his slave boys is
greeting his mother, Giddenis, whom he has just recognized.
<span class="italic">Amma</span> is Punic ’M’, “mother,” a well-attested word.
We have already come across the greeting <span class="italic">auo</span>, which was analyzed as third-person
masculine singular perfect qal of
ḤWY, “live.” Here we expect a feminine form, not a shortened
au, but it is possible that the final vowel was merged
with the following word or that we are dealing with a
scribal error. The spelling of the word with <span class="italic">h</span> in the Palatine
manuscripts in all likelihood does not reflect
the Punic
fricative at the beginning of the word but is the result of a
confusion with Latin <span class="italic">hau</span>(<span class="italic">d</span>), “not.” <span class="italic">Si lli</span> is the relative particle
’Š followed by the preposition L, “for,” with an enclitic
first-person
singular pronoun; gemination of a consonant
after the relative particle could also be observed in l. 933.
The sentence then means “may the mother who is mine
live” or, more prosaically, “greetings to my mother.”</p>
