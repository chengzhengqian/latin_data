<p>The archetype that all our manuscripts go back to presumably
contained both Punic texts and the Latin translation. However,
when two versions of a passage occur side by side in a
manuscript, one is often left out in the process
of copying the
text. The Palatine manuscripts have preserved both Punic texts
with the Latin translation, but the Ambrosian palimpsest lacks
Text 1, the scholar’s version of the Punic passage.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the minor Punic passages that are scattered
over ll. 942–1142 are in the modern orthography in all manuscripts,
which indicates that they were adapted at the same
time that Text 1 was written. Incidentally, the fact that the
palimpsest also employs the modern orthography here is another
indication that its archetype contained the modernized
Text 1.</p>
<p>Neither the old Latin orthography nor the new is good at
indicating pharyngeal and glottal sounds. This means that ‘, <span class="italic">ḥ</span>,’, and even <span class="italic">h</span>, for which Latin did have a letter, are by and large
not written at all. It is unclear whether this indicates that <span class="italic">h</span> was
lost in Punic pronunciation, perhaps together with the other
three sounds, or whether it was not written because it was not
a sound familiar to many Romans. All of these pharyngeal and
glottal sounds were or at least had been highly frequent phonemes;
as a consequence, the signs for them are highly frequent
letters in old inscriptions. Thus it becomes
quite difficult
to identify the Punic words in Latin script with lexemes in
earlier and better understood inscriptions. A problem
of similar
magnitude concerns the sibilants. The Punic texts in the
Latin alphabet do not distinguish between the signs for original
<span class="italic">s, z, ṣ, š</span>, rendering all of them as <span class="italic">s</span>. The modern orthography
did at least have the letter <span class="italic">z</span>, but it does not occur in the Punic
passages, probably because the phoneme was rare in Punic to
