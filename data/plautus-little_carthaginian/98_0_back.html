<p><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> Milphio has asked Hanno and his servants where
they are from and this is the reply he receives. Most of it is
straightforward. The last word, <span class="italic">anech</span>, is the subject pronoun
’NK, “I.” The rest of the sentence forms the verbless
predicate. The first word in the line is the speaker’s name,
Hanno (ḤN’), a common name. This is followed by the
speaker’s filiation, expressed by <span class="italic">byn</span> (BN), “son,” followed
by his father’s name, which was Mytthymbal or rather, with
a more probable vocalization, Matanbaal (MTNB‘L, meaning
“gift of Baal,” the most important
Phoenician god).
What comes
next in the manuscripts makes no sense. Since
Milphio tells Agorastocles that the man they have encountered
is “Hanno from Carthage, the son of the Carthaginian
Mytthymbal,” and since the pieces that are clear from
the Punic correspond well to Milphio’s translation, we can
assume that Hanno also states where he is from, especially
since his statement is a reply to this particular question.
Schröder emended the manuscript readings in a rather
drastic way to <span class="italic">carthadati</span>, QRTḤDTY, “Carthaginian.” This
is the adjective to the place-name
QRT ḤDŠT, Carthage,
which means “New City” (QRT means “city,” and ḤDŠT is
the feminine form of the adjective ḤDŠ, “new”). One
would expect the form QRTḤDŠTY, with Š, but this would
cause metrical difficulties
and the form without Š is attested
on Cyprus, where a city of the same name existed.
