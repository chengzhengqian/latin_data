<span class="italic">ysthyal</span> of l. 931 the (mostly reflexive) stem yitpa‘el is attested.
The verb in question has the root Š’L, “request,” to which a
prefix <span class="italic">yit</span> (here ’<span class="italic">it</span> because it is first-person
singular) is added;
but if the first root consonant
is a sibilant, there is metathesis,
hence the form <span class="italic">ysthyal</span> rather than *<span class="italic">ythsyal.</span></p>
<p>The morphology of the Punic verb is complex. From each
stem two “tenses” can be formed, the perfect (where the persons
are marked by suffixes) and the imperfect (where the
persons are marked by prefixes and sometimes also suffixes).
These “tenses” have temporal, aspectual, and other functions.
Thus the perfect is used for past reference, but also for performative
speech acts (“I hereby do <span class="italic">x</span>”) or wishes. The imperfect
is used for present and future reference but can also occur in
commands.</p>
<p>Punic verbs have both finite and nonfinite forms. The former
inflect for person, number, and, differently from Latin,
gender. Nonfinite verbs are participles and infinitives. Like Hebrew,
Punic distinguishes between the absolute infinitive
and
the construct infinitive. These infinitives have different
morphology
and different syntactic and semantic roles. The former
can, for instance, be combined with free personal pronouns
and function as a narrative verb form, whereas the latter can,
for example, be combined with the preposition L and function
as a purpose clause.</p>
<p>Semitic grammar distinguishes between verbal and nominal
clauses. Verbal clauses describe actions or events and contain
a finite verb, typically at the beginning of the clause, though
Punic is not very strict in this respect. Nominal clauses are
more unusual from a Latin perspective. They describe states
or situations and do not contain finite verbs. The predicate can
consist of, for example, an adjective or a noun. Thus the second
