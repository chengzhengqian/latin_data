<p>“as for his son, one says that he (is) here, Agorastocles”</p>
<p><span class="italic">Latin l. 957:</span> eius filium esse hic praedicant Agorastoclem</p>
<p>“people claim that his son Agorastocles lives here”</p>
<p><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> The construction of the Punic seems to be a Latinism.
The Punic begins with a direct object in imitation
of the Latin accusative and infinitive but later has the subordinator
K. The Punic impersonal construction contains
the noun “man” in combination with the singular participle,
while the Latin text has the impersonal third-person
plural.</p>
