<p class="centered"><span class="italic">The Metrical Structure of the Punic Passages</span></p>
<p>Plautine comedy is entirely in verse, and the short passages in
Punic are metrically integrated into the iambic senarii in which
they are embedded. It is therefore understandable that scholars
have tried to analyze Text 1 and Text 2 as poetry as well.
What structures native Punic poetry had is unknown, but if
Hebrew poetry is anything to go by, it was not metrical and had
no rhymes. In Hebrew poetry, for instance the Psalms or some
passages in the Book of Job, the formal element consists in the
repetition of a thought in slightly modified
form in the next line
(<span class="italic">parallelismus membrorum</span>). It will become obvious from my
analysis of the two long texts that this is not how they are structured.
Instead, it makes more sense to check whether the lines
scan as Roman meters. This approach was already taken by
Sisenna in the first century BC, as the fifth-century
grammarian
Rufinus (<span class="italic">gramm</span>. 6.560.28–561.2) tells us; Sisenna analyzed
the longer
Punic passages as iambics, presumably as iambic
senarii. However, this is possible only if one ignores Punic
vowel quantities as well as Roman rules of scansion. L. 930, for
instance, contains <span class="italic">macom</span> as the penultimate word, followed by
a monosyllable beginning with a consonant. In order to scan
the line as an iambic senarius, one would have to treat <span class="italic">macom</span>
as ending in a short vowel; but it ends in a consonant,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL260_189_12" id="target_note_LCL260_189_12"><sup>12</sup></a> and
the comparative evidence shows that both its vowels are long.
Glück and Maurach (1971–1972) also attempt to scan the text,

but in Latin final–<span class="italic">m</span> was not normally pronounced as a
consonant; it rendered the preceding vowel long and nasalized. To
what extent a genuine Punic pronunciation was aimed at in the performances
of the <span class="italic">Poenulus</span> is unknown.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL260_189_12').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
