ted in all manuscripts, because there are good reasons for
deleting it. The interpretation of the line is not unproblematic.
Sznycer points out that <span class="italic">si corathi</span> had already occurred
in l. 930 and interprets it in the same way as there,
as “whom I invoke/call on.” He regards <span class="italic">muphonnim</span> as a
verb form of PNN, “turn,” a root not actually
attested in
Punic but corresponding to the Hebrew root PNH with the
same meaning. Krahmalkov’s interpretation is completely
different. He wants the sentence to mean “do you remember
any Punic?,” corresponding to what Milphio asks Agorastocles
in l. 985; why this should be the case is unclear.
For Krahmalkov, <span class="italic">mu</span> is the question word “what,” already
seen in l. 1010, but he interprets it as introducing a yes-or-
no
question, for which there are neither Punic nor Hebrew
parallels. He takes <span class="italic">phonnim</span> to mean “Punic.” Formally
<span class="italic">phonnim</span> is a masculine plural (“Phoenicians”), but Krahmalkov
points out that the masculine plural is attested as a
language name elsewhere (KRSYM, “the Corsic language”).
<span class="italic">Sicorathim</span> is then taken as a form of ZKR, “remember,”
a root attested in both Punic and Hebrew. However,
since there is no reason why Hanno should just utter
a translation of Milphio’s earlier words, a different interpretation
seems more likely. I think Sznycer is right in taking
<span class="italic">si corathi</span> as “whom I am calling on” again. I would
prefer to interpret <span class="italic">phonnim</span> as “Phoenicians” rather than as
a language name. As for the question word <span class="italic">mu</span>, I would
like to take it as negative particle; this of course has no parallels
in Punic, where question words are not attested in inscriptions,
but the equivalent Hebrew question word MH,
“what,” has negative meaning from time to time, a meaning
it acquired when a negative answer was expected. If my interpretation
