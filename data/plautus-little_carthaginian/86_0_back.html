<p>Punic, like Hebrew, has both free and suffixed pronouns.
Subject pronouns and demonstrative pronouns in all syntactic
functions are free. By contrast, object pronouns are expressed
as verbal suffixes and possessive pronouns as nominal ones;
prepositions are also mostly combined with suffixed rather than
free pronouns.</p>
<p>The Semitic verb system is highly complex. At its heart lie
verb roots which typically, though not always, have three consonants.
Verb roots that maintain three consonants throughout
all stems are said to belong to the “strong” verbs, whereas verb
roots that only have two consonants or lose one or two consonants
when prefixes or suffixes are added belong to the “weak”
verbs.</p>
<p>From most verb roots different stems can be formed by
adding prefixes, geminating consonants, or modifying the vocalism.
Different stems are used for active, passive, causative,
reflexive, and so on. The basic active stem is called qal in Hebrew
(<span class="italic">qal</span> = “light”), and Phoenician grammars typically adopt
this term as well; since its third-person singular masculine has
no affixes and, like the other forms of the basic stem, no geminate
consonants, it is often used as the base form in dictionaries.
Other stems are traditionally named after the third-person
masculine singular forms of the verb P‘L, “do, make.” Thus
there is a stem pi‘el, which ought to have a geminate second
consonant (but ‘cannot be geminated); its meaning is causative
(“make someone do something”), intensive (“do something intensely/repeatedly”),
or factitive (“bring about a state”). In l.
938 we have the form <span class="italic">bynny</span>, which seems to be the pi‘el of the
weak root BYN, “notice”; the meaning is causative: “make notice”
= “show.” Another stem is called pu‘al (see the form <span class="italic">tumam</span>
in l. 941); it is the passive equivalent of the pi‘el. In
