here combined with an enclitic first-person
singular
pronoun. YTMM is the third-person
masculine singular
imperfect pu‘al of TMM, “be good,” with the initial vowel
lost by scribal error or merged with the preceding word. If
Sznycer is correct, this part means “that my entrance (into
this city) will be made perfect.” This corresponds well with
