<p>At a relatively early stage, the Greeks took over the Phoenician
alphabet. Several Phoenician consonant sounds had no
equivalent in Greek, which allowed the Greeks to use the signs
for these sounds in a different function, as vowel signs. A West
Greek variety of the alphabet was subsequently adopted by the
Etruscans, who passed it on to the Romans.</p>
<p>Much later, vocalism began to be indicated in biblical Hebrew.
The vocalism of Phoenician (and Punic) can be reconstructed
partly through comparison with Hebrew and other
Semitic languages which marked vowels in their scripts, partly
through the study of later developments within Phoenician and
Punic, and partly through the analysis of borrowings and information
arising through language contact. Nevertheless, a number
of uncertainties remain.</p>
<p>Among the stops, <span class="italic">ṭ</span> and <span class="italic">ḳ</span> are called “emphatic.” Like their
nonemphatic counterparts <span class="italic">t</span> and <span class="italic">k</span> they were voiceless, and
their emphatic quality was probably a pharyngeal secondary
articulation; phoneticians would write the nonemphatic stops
as [t] and [k] and the emphatic ones as

articulation resulted in a retraction of the tongue root and
thus, in the case of <span class="italic">ḳ</span>, in a uvular rather than a velar closure
(hence the symbol <span class="italic">q</span>).’ is a glottal stop [ʔ] as in the London
