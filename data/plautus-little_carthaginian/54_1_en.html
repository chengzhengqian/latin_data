GG ‘is attested as the name of a profession in a Punic inscription; since the inscription leaves it unclear what that profession is, and since Hanno has clearly traveled, I have translated the word as “tradesman,” a term which Agorastocles may be familiar with despite not speaking Punic. Gratwick prefers to give the last sentence to Milphio and to regard <span class="italic">gugga</span> as the name of a bird. In Greek the <span class="italic">gyges</span> is the bittern, but Gratwick prefers to see in the bird the purple heron, which would introduce a rather complex pun: Phoenicians traded in purple, and
hence Hanno can be seen as a purple heron; the heron was also called
the “treacherous bird” by the Romans, and this association would introduce
negative stereotyping of Carthaginians.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL260_123_53a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL260_123_54"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL260_123_54" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">54</sup>They cannot walk upright because of the heavy weight and hence
