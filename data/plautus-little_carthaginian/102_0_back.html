is correct, the sentence means “the ones I am
calling on are not Phoenicians.” Hanno has realized that
his interlocutors are not Phoenicians (and hence know no
Punic).</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Discussion:</span> Two words in this sentence are clear beyond
doubt. <span class="italic">Bal samem</span>, attested also as <span class="italic">Baalsamen</span> in Augustine
(<span class="italic">Quaest. Hept.</span> 7.16), is the name of the highest Punic deity,
B‘L ŠMM, or “lord of the heavens.” ŠMM, “heavens,”
is a noun attested only in the plural in both Punic and Hebrew.
The beginning of the line is more difficult.
If one accepts
the reading of the palimpsest, <span class="italic">gune</span> could be the construct
state plural of G’N, “majesty,” a noun not attested in
Punic but common in Hebrew, especially in combination
with divine names. The last word has to remain obscure.
The Palatine manuscripts deviate markedly from the Ambrosian
palimpsest here. Schröder treats <span class="italic">ierasan</span> as
’ḤRŠNY (or, perhaps better, ’ḤRŠNW), the first-person
singular perfect jif‘il of ḤRŠ, “be silent.” The root is attested
only in Hebrew, not in Punic, but in Hebrew the
causative meaning of this stem is securely attested. If correct,
the perfect is used either as a wish or as a performative
speech act. The sentence would then mean: “O majesty
of the lord of the heavens, I’m silencing him!”
However, certainty for the second half of the sentence cannot
be reached.</p>
