reason? It is because day-books last for a month, ledgers for ever; day-books are immediately destroyed, ledgers are religiously preserved; day-books embrace the memory of a moment, ledgers attest the good faith and conscientiousness which ensure a man’s reputation for all time; day-books are ill-arranged, ledgers are put together in order. This is why no one ever produces day-books in court; it is ledgers that are produced, it is account-books that are read.</p>

<p>III. You, Gaius Piso, distinguished as you are by integrity, virtue, dignity, and authority, would not venture to make a claim for money on the strength of day-books. As for myself, I ought not to dwell any<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> longer on matters as to which custom is perfectly clear; but I ask this question which is extremely pertinent to the matter in hand: How long is it, Fannius, since you entered this item in your daybooks? He blushes, he does not know what to answer, he cannot invent anything on the spur of the moment. “It is now two months ago,” you will say. Yet it ought to have been entered in the ledger of receipts and expenses. “It is more than six months.” Why then did this item remain so long forgotten in the day-book? What pray, if it is more than three years ago? How is it that, when all other people who make up account-books transfer their accounts nearly every month into their books, you allow this item to lie neglected in your day-book for more than three years? Have you arranged all the other items of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> receipts and expenses in the ledger or not? If you have not, how do you make up your books? if you have, why is it that, when entering all the other items in order, you left this item, which was an extremely large one, for more than three years in your day-book?
