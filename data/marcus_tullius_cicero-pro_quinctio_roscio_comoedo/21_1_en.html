The judge? It is Cluvius. What does he say? That Flavius paid Fannius 100,000 sesterces on account of Panurgus. Consider Cluviusâ€™s position: he is a Roman knight; his life: he is a man of the greatest distinction; the confidence he inspires: you accepted him as judge; his truthfulness: he said what he could and ought to have known.
