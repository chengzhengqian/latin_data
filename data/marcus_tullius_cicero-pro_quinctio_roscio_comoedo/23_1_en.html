though not by the attestation of his own conscience?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_319_a" id="target_note_LCL240_319_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Because the gods punish equally the perjurer and the liar; for it is not the form of words, in which an oath is embodied, but the perfidy and wickedness whereby a snare is set for someone, that excites the wrath and indignation of the immortal gods. But I on the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">47</span><span class="br"></span> contrary maintain that the authority of Cluvius would have less weight if he had spoken on oath than it now has, when he is not on oath. For then he might perhaps appear to ill-disposed persons to be too much of a partisan if they saw him acting as a witness in a cause in which he had been judge; but now every citizen must consider him to be a man of the highest integrity and the greatest steadfastness, who tells his own intimates what he knows.</p>
<p>Say now, if you can, if the fact, if the cause allows<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">48</span><span class="br"></span> you, that Cluvius lied! Cluvius lied? Truth itself lays hands on me and compels me to stop and dwell upon this point for a few moments. What then was the origin of all these lies and where were they forged? Roscius of course is a cunning and crafty man. This is how he began to reason: “Since Fannius claims 50,000 sesterces from me, I will ask Gaius Cluvius, a Roman knight and a man of the highest distinction, to tell a lie for my sake, to say that an agreement was made which was not made, that 100,000 sesterces were given by Flavius to Fannius, which were not given.” This is the first thought of a dishonest mind, of a pitiable disposition, of a lack of sense.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_319_b" id="target_note_LCL240_319_b"><sup>b</sup></a> What next? Having plucked up courage, he approached Cluvius.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">49</span><span class="br"></span> What kind of man is he? a trifler? No, most serious.
