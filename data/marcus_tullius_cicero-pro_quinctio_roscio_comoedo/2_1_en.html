disbursed unless he had been authorized by Roscius? Would not Roscius also have made an entry of money disbursed to him, if he had authorized Chaerea to make it? For it is as dishonourable not to enter what you owe as it is disgraceful to set down as due from another what is not due. For the account-books of one who has not entered what is true are as much to be condemned as those of one who has written down<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_277_a" id="target_note_LCL240_277_a"><sup>a</sup></a> what is false. But see how far I am ready to go, relying upon the ample means I possess for proving my cause. If Gaius Fannius produces his accounts of money received and expended, set down in his own interest and in accordance with his pleasure, I have no objection to your giving judgement in his favour. What brother or father thinks so highly of his brother<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> or son as to regard as confirmed whatever either of them has entered in his books? Roscius will regard it as confirmed; produce your books; what you may have been convinced of, he will be convinced of; what you may have approved of, he will approve of. A little time ago we asked for the account-books of Marcus Perpenna and Publius Saturius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_277_b" id="target_note_LCL240_277_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; we now urgently call for yours alone, Gaius Fannius Chaerea, and have no objection to judgement being given according to them in your favour; so why do you not produce them? Does he not make up his books? On the contrary, most carefully. Does he not enter<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> small amounts in his ledgers? On the contrary, every sum. Is this debt unimportant and trifling? It is 100,000 sesterces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_277_ca" id="target_note_LCL240_277_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> How is it that such a

But it should be remembered that four sesterces make a denarius, which, like the δράχμη, was the average wage of a day-labourer, the “penny a day” of the New Testament. This seems a very large sum, and it is suggested that the most Fannius claimed was 50,000 sesterces (see § 38).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_277_ca').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
