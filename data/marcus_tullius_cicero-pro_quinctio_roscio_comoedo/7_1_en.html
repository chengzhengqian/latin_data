Fannius has ventured to apply to an arbitrator from a judge! The man who, as regards the sum of money, assuming that his <span class="italic">tabulae</span> were trustworthy, has accepted an <span class="italic">arbiter,</span> has passed judgement that the money was not due.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_287_a" id="target_note_LCL240_287_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>Two parts of the cause are now finished. Fannius admits that he did not pay the money,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_287_b" id="target_note_LCL240_287_b"><sup>b</sup></a> he does not say that he entered it as paid, since he does not quote his account-books. His only remaining alternative is to say that he made a stipulation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_287_c" id="target_note_LCL240_287_c"><sup>c</sup></a> For I cannot imagine how there can be any other way of claiming a fixed sum of money.</p>

<p>[V.] You made a stipulation: when? on what day? at what time? in whose presence? who says that I made a promise? Nobody. If I were to finish my pleading at this point, I should<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> think that I had done enough to prove my good faith and carefulness, enough for the cause and the question at issue, enough for the formula and the “engagement,” enough even to convince the judge why a decision ought to be given in favour of Roscius. A fixed sum of money has been claimed; an “engagement” has been given for a third part of it. This money must either have been a loan or a literal or a verbal contract. Fannius admits that it was not lent; his ledgers prove that it was not a literal contract, the silence of witnesses proves that it was not a stipulation. Need I say more? But since the defendant<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> is a man who has always thought very little of money, but has considered his reputation to be most sacred; since the judge is a man whose favourable opinion of us we desire as much as his decision in our favour; since the distinguished and brilliant assembly of counsel<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_287_da" id="target_note_LCL240_287_da"><sup>d</sup></a>
