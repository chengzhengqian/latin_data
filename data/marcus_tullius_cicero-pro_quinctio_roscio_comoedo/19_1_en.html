covered all his debts? Why, in a matter of so long ago, in an affair which is settled and done with, in the case of a partnership that is now dissolved, why is this new counter-stipulation introduced? Who drew up and witnessed it? Who was the arbitrator? You, Piso; for it was you who requested Roscius to give Fannius 100,000 sesterces<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_311_a" id="target_note_LCL240_311_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to compensate him for his trouble and labour, because he had been Roscius’s agent, because he had given security and appeared in court on several occasions, on condition that Fannius would pay Roscius half of what he recovered from Flavius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_311_ba" id="target_note_LCL240_311_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> Does not that counter-stipulation itself sufficiently prove that Roscius made an agreement for himself only? But perhaps you may think<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span> that Fannius made a counter-promise to pay Roscius half of what he might get from Flavius, but that he got nothing at all. What does that matter? You ought to consider, not the result of the claim, but the origin of the counter-promise. Nor, if he did not want to proceed against Flavius, did he thereby, as far as it depended on him, any the less declare his opinion that Roscius had compounded for his own share only, not for the association. But what if I make it clear that, after the old agreement of Roscius and after this recent counter-promise of Fannius, Fannius recovered 100,000 sesterces from Flavius on account of Panurgus? will he still any longer dare to scoff at the reputation of that most excellent man, Quintus Roscius?</p>
