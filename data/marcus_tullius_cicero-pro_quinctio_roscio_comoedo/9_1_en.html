Quintus Roscius? What say you? If hot coals, when thrown into water, are at once cooled and extinguished, do not the fiery arrows of slander, when brought up against a life of the greatest innocence and purity, immediately fall to the ground and lose their fire? Roscius cheated his partner! Can such an offence be fastened on this man? a man who, so help me the god of truth! (and I say so quite fearlessly) has in him more good faith than art, more truth than learning; a man whom the Roman people respects more highly as a man than as an actor, who by his talent is most worthy of the stage as he is of the senate by his purity of life. But why am I so<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> foolish as to speak of Roscius before Piso? I am praising him at some length—an unknown man, no doubt! Is there any man in the world of whom you have a better opinion? Is there anyone whom you think more virtuous, more modest, more refined, more ready to oblige, or more generous? Well? do you, Saturius, who appear against him, hold a different opinion? In this cause, as often as you had occasion to mention his name, did you not each time declare that he was an honourable man and that you spoke of him with respect<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_291_a" id="target_note_LCL240_291_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—a compliment usually paid only to a most distinguished person or a most intimate friend? In this you seemed to me to be absurdly<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> inconsistent, in praising and attacking the same man, in calling him at one and the same time a most excellent man and a thorough rascal. Did you mention the same man out of respect, call him most distinguished, and at the same time accuse him of having cheated his partner? But, I suppose, your praise was a tribute paid to truth, the accusation was a concession to influence. It was you who were speaking
