You did not want it to be known that Roscius was indebted to you. Why then did you put it down? “You had been asked not to enter it.” Why then did you put it down in your day-book?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_283_a" id="target_note_LCL240_283_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>But although I consider this is sufficiently convincing, I cannot feel satisfied unless I obtain evidence from Fannius himself that this money is not owing to him.
