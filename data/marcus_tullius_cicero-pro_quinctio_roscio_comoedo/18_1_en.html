know it. He did not know that Fannius was Roscius’s partner. He knew it perfectly well, for he was at law with him at the time.

<p>XIII. But lest perchance you should say that I have promised what I cannot perform, it is you, you, I say, Fannius, whom I will rouse from your benches<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_309_b" id="target_note_LCL240_309_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as a witness against yourself. What is your accusation? That Roscius made a settlement with Flavius on behalf of the partnership. When?

Three years ago you made a counter-promise to Roscius. What? Read that counter-stipulation clearly. Listen, Piso, I beg. Against his will, shuffling backwards and forwards, Fannius is compelled by me to give evidence against himself. For what does the counter-stipulation proclaim? I <span class="sc">promise to pay
roscius half of what I receive from flavius.</span>
These are your own words, Fannius. What can you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span> get from Flavius, if he owes nothing?
