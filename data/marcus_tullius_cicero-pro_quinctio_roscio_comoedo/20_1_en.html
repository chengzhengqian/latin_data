neither get security from Roscius nor was released from the action of Fannius? But now I want to know the meaning of something strange and incredible: why, after he had come to a settlement with Roscius about the whole affair, did he make a separate payment of 100,000 sesterces to Fannius? On this point, Saturius, I should like to know what answer you propose to make; that Fannius never got 100,000 sesterces at all from Flavius or that he got them on some other claim or for some other reason? If for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">41</span><span class="br"></span> some other reason, what dealings had you had with him previously? None. Had he been handed over to you as a debtor?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_313_a" id="target_note_LCL240_313_a"><sup>a</sup></a> No. I am wasting time uselessly. “Fannius” says he “did not get 100,000 sesterces from Flavius, neither on account of Panurgus nor anyone else.” If I prove that, after this recent stipulation of Roscius, you got 100,000 sesterces from Flavius, can you give any reason why you should not leave the court defeated and disgraced?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_313_ba" id="target_note_LCL240_313_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> By whose<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">42</span><span class="br"></span> evidence then shall I prove this? This affair, I believe, came into court. Certainly. Who was the plaintiff? Fannius. Who was the defendant? Flavius. Who was the judge? Cluvius. I must produce one of these men as a witness to say that the money was paid. Whose evidence would have the greatest weight? Indisputably, that of him who has been approved of by the general verdict [as judge]. Which of these three men, then, will you expect me to produce as a witness? The plaintiff? It is Fannius; he will never give evidence against himself. The defendant? It is Flavius; he has been dead a long time; if he were alive, you would hear him speak.
