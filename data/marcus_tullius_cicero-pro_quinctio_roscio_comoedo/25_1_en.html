that Flavius had given Fannius 100,000 rather than 300,000 sesterces, since, according to the counter-stipulation,
half of the sum belonged to Roscius? You can now understand, Piso, that Roscius claimed for himself alone, but nothing for the partnership. Since Saturius feels that this is quite clear, he does not venture to resist and fight against the truth, but immediately discovers another retreat for fraud and treachery. “I admit,” says he, “that Roscius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">52</span><span class="br"></span> claimed only his share from Flavius; I grant that he left Fannius’s share free and untouched; but I maintain that what he obtained for himself became the common property of the partnership.” No manner of reasoning can be more captious or scandalous than this. I ask: could Roscius have been able or not to claim his share in accordance with the partnership? if he could not, how did he get the money? if he could, how was it that he did not demand and get it for himself, for what is claimed for oneself is certainly not demanded for another? Is it not so? If Roscius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">53</span><span class="br"></span> had claimed what belonged to the partnership as a whole, the money received would have been shared equally by all; now, since he demanded what belonged to his own share only, did he not demand what he then got for himself alone?</p>
