What is the formula in arbitration? It is mild and moderate: <span class="sc">as much as it seems fair and just should be given.</span> Yet in this case the claimant admits that he is asking for more than is due to him, but he says that he will be satisfied and more than satisfied with what is awarded him by the arbitrator. Thus the one has confidence in his cause, the other has not.

Who was the arbitrator in this matter? Would that he was in Rome! He is in Rome. Would that he were on the bench! He is. Would that he were sitting as Piso’s assessor! It is the same Piso himself. Did you accept the same man as arbitrator and judge? Did you allow the same man unlimited freedom of action and also tie him down to the narrowest formula of the agreement? Who ever obtained all that he claimed before an arbitrator? Nobody; for he only claimed what it seemed fair and right should be given him. You have now come before a judge with a claim for the same amount as that for which you approached an arbitrator!
