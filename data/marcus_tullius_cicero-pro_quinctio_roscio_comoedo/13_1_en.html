indeed really so? Will you secure the condemnation by a judge, who has none of the powers of an arbitrator in a matter like this, of the man whom you could not get the better of before an arbitrator, whose proper function it was to pronounce a decision upon it?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_299_a" id="target_note_LCL240_299_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Then either launch this charge where it is lawful to start an action<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_299_b" id="target_note_LCL240_299_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or do not launch it where it ought not to be brought. However, your own evidence has already refuted it. For at the time when you refused to employ that formula, you indicated that Roscius had not been guilty of fraud against the partnership. Have you the account-books or not? If not, how can there be an arrangement? If you have, why not name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_299_c" id="target_note_LCL240_299_c"><sup>c</sup></a> the arrangement? Say now that Roscius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> asked you to accept his own friend as arbitrator! He did not do so. Say that he made an arrangement in order to be acquitted! He made no arrangement. Ask why he was acquitted. Because he was perfectly innocent and a man of the highest integrity. For what took place? You went to Roscius’s house of your own accord; you apologized; you begged him to pardon your hasty action<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_299_d" id="target_note_LCL240_299_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and to inform the judge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_299_e" id="target_note_LCL240_299_e"><sup>e</sup></a> that an arrangement had been come to; you said that you would not appear again, and loudly declared that nothing was owing to you from the partnership. Roscius informed the judge and was acquitted. And yet do you still venture to mention fraud and theft? Fannius persists in his impudence. “Yes,” says he, “but he had made an arrangement with me.” Of course, to avoid being condemned. But what reason was there why he should be afraid of being condemned? The fact was clear, the theft was obvious.</p>
