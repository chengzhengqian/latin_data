But if anyone can claim for another, but<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">54</span><span class="br"></span> has not been appointed his agent, I ask why, after Panurgus had been killed, and an action for damages had been begun against Flavius, why it was that you were made the agent of Roscius for that action, especially as you argued that, whatever you claimed in your name, you claimed for him, and whatever you claimed and got for yourself fell to the partnership. But if nothing of what you got from Flavius would have come to Roscius, unless he had appointed you his agent in the suit, nothing of what Roscius got for his share ought to come to you, since he was not appointed your agent.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_325_aa" id="target_note_LCL240_325_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> Now, what answer will you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">55</span><span class="br"></span> be able to make to this, Fannius? When Roscius made an arrangement with Flavius for his own share, did he leave you your right of action or not? If not, how did you afterwards get 100,000 sesterces from Flavius? If he did, why do you claim from Roscius what you ought to claim and try to obtain yourself? In fact, a partnership is very like an inheritance, a kind of twin sister; just as a partner has a share in a partnership, so an heir has a share in an inheritance. As an heir claims for himself alone, not for his coheirs, so a partner claims for himself alone, not for his co-partners; and, as each claims for his own share, so he pays for his own share only, the heir in proportion to the share for which he entered on his inheritance, the partner in proportion to the share for which he entered the partnership.

His explanation is the following. “The fact of Fannius being named as Roscius’s <span class="italic">cognitor</span> in the action of Roscius against Flavius implies that Fannius acted for Roscius only and not for the partnership. If Fannius, as <span class="italic">cognitor,</span> considers that he had an interest in that suit, we must assume that Roscius’s share of what Fannius might get in an action against Flavius depended on Fannius being made <span class="italic">cognitor</span> in the action of Roscius against Flavius; then, as Fannius had not made Roscius his <span class="italic">cognitor</span> in his (Fannius’s) action against Flavius he was not entitled to anything that Roscius had got in the arrangement with Flavius.” But the argument remains obscure.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_325_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
