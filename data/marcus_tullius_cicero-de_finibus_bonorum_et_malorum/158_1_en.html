Preceding thinkers, and among them most explicitly Polemo, had explained the Chief Good as being ‘to live in accordance with nature.’ This formula receives from the Stoics three interpretations. The first runs thus, ‘to live in the light of a knowledge of the natural sequence of causation.’ This conception of the End they declare to be identical with Zeno’s, being an explanation of your phrase ‘to live in agreement <span class="innerMarginNote left">15</span> with nature.’ Their second interpretation is that<span class="marginNote right">interpreted as life endowed with the objects in accordance with nature.</span>
it means the same as ‘to live in the performance of all, or most, of one’s intermediate duties.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL040_317_a" id="target_note_LCL040_317_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The Chief Good as thus expounded is not the same as that of the preceding interpretation. That is ‘right action’ (as you rendered <span class="italic">katorthõma</span>), and can be achieved only by the Wise Man, but this belongs to duty merely inchoate, so to speak, and not perfect, which may sometimes be attained by the foolish. Again, the third interpretation of the formula is ‘to live in the enjoyment of all, or of the greatest, of those things which are in accordance with nature.’ This does not depend solely on our own conduct, for it involves two factors, first a mode of life enjoying virtue, secondly a supply of the things which are in accordance with nature but which are not within our control. But the Chief Good as understood in the third and last interpretation, and life passed on the basis of the Chief Good, being inseparably coupled with virtue, lie within the reach of the Wise Man alone; and this is the account of the End of Goods, as we read in the writings of the Stoics themselves, which was given by Xenocrates and Aristotle. They therefore describe the primary constitution of nature, which was your starting point also, more or less in the following terms.</p>
