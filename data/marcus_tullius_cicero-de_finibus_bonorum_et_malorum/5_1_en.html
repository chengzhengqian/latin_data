the Greeks as a philosopher. Still, you yourself challenged me to the venture, by dedicating to me your delightful essay <span class="italic">On Virtue.</span> But I have no doubt that the reason why some people take a dislike to Latin literature is that they have happened to meet with certain illiterate and uncouth productions which are bad Greek books in worse Latin versions. I have no quarrel with these persons, provided that they also refuse to read the Greek writers on the same subjects. But given a noble theme, and a refined, dignified and graceful style, who would not read a Latin book? Unless it be some one ambitious to be styled a Greek out-and-out, as <span class="innerMarginNote left">9</span> Albucius was greeted by Scaevola when the latter was praetor at Athens. I am again referring to Lucilius, who relates the anecdote with much neatness and point; he puts the following excellent lines into the mouth of Scaevola:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“You vow’d, Albucius, that to suit ye</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">‘Twas as a Greek we must repute ye;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">You scorn’d to own your native town,—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">And so, at Athens when I lay,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And your respects you came to pay,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">My worship, humouring your freak,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Gave you good-morrow straight in Greek,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line">—Hence comes it that Albucius hates me,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Hence as his bitterest foe he rates me.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
