I won’t jest with you now, as I did on the same subjects when you were prosecuting and I defending Lucius Murena.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL040_383_a" id="target_note_LCL040_383_a"><sup>a</sup></a> On that occasion I was addressing a jury, not an audience of scholars, and I even had to play to the gallery a little; but now I must reason <span class="innerMarginNote left">75</span> more closely. Transgressions are equal.—How so, pray?—Because nothing can be better than good or baser than base.—Explain further, for there is much disagreement on this point; let us have your special arguments to prove how all transgressions are equal,—Suppose, says my opponent, of a number of lyres not one is so strung as to be in tune; then all are equally out of tune; similarly with transgressions, since all are departures from rule, all are equally departures from rule; therefore all are equal.—Here we are put off with an equivocation.
