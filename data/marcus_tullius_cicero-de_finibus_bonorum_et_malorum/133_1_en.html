They fail to see that some things are rendered more valuable <span class="innerMarginNote left">48</span> by brevity as others by prolongation. So it would be consistent with the principles already stated that on the theory of those who deem the End of Goods,<span class="marginNote right">Wisdom incapable of degree,</span>
that which we term the extreme or ultimate Good, to be capable of degree, they should also hold that one man can be wiser than another, and similarly that one can commit a more sinful or more righteous action than another; which it is not open to us to say, who do not think that the End of Goods can vary in degree. For just as a drowning man is no more able to breathe if he be not far from the surface of the water, so that he might at any moment emerge, than if he were actually at the bottom already, and just as a puppy on the point of opening its eyes is no less blind than one just born, similarly a man that has made some progress towards the state of virtue is none the less in misery than he that has made no progress at all.</p>
