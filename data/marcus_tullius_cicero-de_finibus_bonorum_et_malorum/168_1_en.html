total. This point established, it will then be open to us to investigate at our leisure your questions about the importance of the separate items, and the value of their respective contributions to happiness, and about that eclipse, as you call it, of the things so small as to be almost or quite imperceptible. Then what of a point on which no disagreement<span class="marginNote right">A creature’s Chief Good must be the good of the whole of it;</span>

For the analogy to hold, every other species also would have to find its End in that part of the organism which in that particular species is the highest part; since that, as we have seen, is how the Stoics conceive the End of man. <span class="innerMarginNote left">34</span> Why then do you hesitate to alter your conception<span class="marginNote right">or else the Stoics should say that the primary impulse is to cherish the best part of oneself only</span>
