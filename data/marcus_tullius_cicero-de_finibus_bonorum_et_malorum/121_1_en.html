manner it is by no means surprising that though we are first commended to Wisdom by the primary natural instincts, afterwards Wisdom itself becomes dearer to us than are the instincts from which we came to her. And just as our limbs are so fashioned that it is clear that they were bestowed upon us with a view to a certain mode of life, so our faculty of appetition, in Greek <span class="italic">hormē,</span> was obviously designed not for any kind of life one may choose, but for a particular mode ot living: and the same is true of Reason and of perfected <span class="innerMarginNote left">24</span> Reason. For just as an actor or dancer has<span class="marginNote right">Wisdom its own End.</span>
assigned to him not any but a certain particular part or dance, so life has to be conducted in a certain fixed way, and not in any way we like. This fixed way we speak of as ‘conformable’ and suitable. In fact we do not consider Wisdom to be like seamanship or medicine, but rather like the arts of acting and of dancing just mentioned; its End, being the actual exercise<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL040_243_a" id="target_note_LCL040_243_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the art, is contained within the art itself, and is not something extraneous to it. At the same time there is also another point which marks a dissimilarity between Wisdom and these arts as well. In the latter a movement perfectly executed nevertheless does not involve all the various motions which together constitute the subject matter of the art; whereas in the sphere of conduct, what we may call, if you approve, ‘right<span class="marginNote right">‘Right actions’ each include every aspect of Virture, which is on</span>

For Wisdom alone is entirely self-contained, <span class="innerMarginNote left">25</span> which is not the case with the other arts. It is erroneous, however, to place the End of medicine or of navigation exactly on a par with the End of Wisdom. For Wisdom includes also magnanimity
