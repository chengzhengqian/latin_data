The second class of critics, who, however much they<span class="marginNote right">and of thorough study</span>

The study is one that when once taken up admits of no restriction or control. In fact, the attitude of the former class, who attempt to dissuade us from philosophy altogether, seems almost less unreasonable than that of those who would set limits to what is essentially unlimited, and expect us to stop half-way in a study <span class="innerMarginNote left">3</span> that increases in value the further it proceeds.
