As a matter of fact it is entirely the other way about: it is impossible to find a place for virtue, unless all the things that she chooses and rejects are reckoned towards one sum-total of good, For if we entirely ignore ourselves,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL040_345_a" id="target_note_LCL040_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a> we shall fall into the mistakes and errors of Aristo, forgetting the things that we assigned as the origins of virtue nature herself; if while not ignoring these things, we yet do not reckon them in the End or Chief Good, we shall be well on the road towards the extravagances of Erillus, since we shall have to adopt two different rules of life at once.
