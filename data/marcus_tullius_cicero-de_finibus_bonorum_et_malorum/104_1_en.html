<span class="innerMarginNote left">116</span><p>XXXV. “Read the panegyrics, Torquatus, not of the heroes praised by Homer, not of Cyrus or Agesilaus, Aristides or Themistocles, Philip or Alexander; but read those delivered upon our own great men, read those of your own family. You will not find anyone extolled for his skill and cunning in procuring pleasures. This is not what is conveyed by epitaphs, like that one near the city gate:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line"><span class="sc">Here lyeth one whom many lands agree</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="sc">Rome’s first and greatest citizen to be</span>.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<span class="innerMarginNote left">117</span><p class="noindent">Do we suppose that many lands agreed that<span class="marginNote right">Hedonism must subvert morals.</span>
Calatinus was Rome’s greatest citizen because of his surpassing eminence in the acquisition of pleasures? Then are we to say that a youth is a young man of great promise and high character, when we judge him likely to study his own interests and to do whatever will be for his personal advantage? Do we not see what a universal upheaval and confusion would result from such a principle? It does away with generosity and with gratitude, the bonds of mutual harmony. If you lend a man money for your own advantage, this cannot be considered an act of generosity—it is usury; no gratitude is owing to a man who lends money for gain. In fact if pleasure usurps the sovereignty, all the cardinal virtues must inevitably be dethroned; and also there are a number of base qualities which can with difficulty be proved inconsistent with the character of the Wise Man, unless it be a law of <span class="innerMarginNote left">118</span> nature that moral goodness should be supreme. Not<span class="marginNote right">Personal appeal to Torquatus.</span>
to bring forward further arguments (for they are countless in number), any sound commendation of Virtue must needs keep Pleasure at arm’s length.
