happiness of the Wise Man to attain its final and ultimate perfection, if all his wise designs and good deeds were to be successively erased from his <span class="innerMarginNote left">106</span> memory. But with you it is the recollection of pleasures enjoyed that gives happiness; and those must be bodily pleasures,—for if it be any others, it ceases to be true that mental pleasures all arise from the connection of the mind with the body. Yet if bodily pleasure even when past can give delight, I do not see why Aristotle<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL040_199_a" id="target_note_LCL040_199_a"><sup>a</sup></a> should be so contemptuous of the epitaph of Sardanapalus. The famous Syrian monarch boasts that he has taken with him all the sensual pleasures that he has enjoyed. How, asks Aristotle, could a dead man continue to experience a feeling which even while alive he could only be conscious of so long as he was actually enjoying it?

dictum of your school, that all mental pleasures and pains alike are based on pleasures and pains of the body? Do you, Torquatus (for I bethink me who it is I am addressing)—do you personally never experience
