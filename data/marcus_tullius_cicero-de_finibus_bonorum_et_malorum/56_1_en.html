possibly therefore call a thing the Chief Good with regard to living, when we feel we cannot call it so even in regard to dining? But how says our philosopher?<span class="marginNote right">and morerover his three-fold classificaton of Desires is illogical and misleading</span>
The desires are of three kinds, natural and necessary, natural but not necessary, neither natural nor necessary.’ To begin with, this is a clumsy division; it makes three classes when there are really only two. This is not dividing but hacking in pieces. Thinkers trained in the science which Epicurus despised usually put it thus: ‘The desires are of two kinds, natural and imaginary<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL040_113_a" id="target_note_LCL040_113_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; natural desires again fall into two subdivisions, necessary and not necessary.’ That would have rounded it off properly.
