governed by a divine mind and substance. In point of fullness, however, and fertility of treatment we shall find the Stoics meagre, whereas the Peripatetics <span class="innerMarginNote left">13</span> are copious in the extreme. What stores of facts they observed and recorded about the classification, reproduction, morphology and life-history of animals of every kind! and again about plants! How copious and wide in range their explanations of the causes and demonstrations of the mode of different natural phenomena! and all these stores supply them with numerous and conclusive arguments to explain the nature of each particular thing. So far then, as far as I at least can understand the case, there appears to have been no reason for the change of name<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL040_315_a" id="target_note_LCL040_315_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; that Zeno was not prepared to follow the Peripatetics in every detail did not alter the fact that he had sprung from them.
