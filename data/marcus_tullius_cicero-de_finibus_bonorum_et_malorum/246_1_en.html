no one doubted that all hope alike of right conduct and of happiness lay in virtue. Zeno having learnt this doctrine from our school proceeded to deal with ‘the same matter in another manner,’ as the common preamble<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL040_493_a" id="target_note_LCL040_493_a"><sup>a</sup></a> to an indictment has it. You now approve of this procedure on his part. He, no doubt, can change the names of things and be acquitted of in consistency, but we cannot! He denies that the life of Metellus was happier than that of Regulus, yet calls it ‘preferable’; not more desirable, but ‘more worthy of adoption’; and given the choice, that of Metellus is ‘to be selected’ and that of Regulus rejected.’ Whereas the life he called ‘preferable’ and ‘more worthy to be selected’ I term happier, though I do not assign any the minutest fraction more value to <span class="innerMarginNote left">89</span> that life than do the Stoics. What is the difference, except that I call familiar things familiar names, whereas they invent new terms to express the same meaning? Thus just as in the senate there is always some one who demands an interpreter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL040_493_b" id="target_note_LCL040_493_b"><sup>b</sup></a> so we must use an interpreter when we give audience to your school. I call whatever is in accordance with nature good and what is contrary to nature bad; nor am I alone in this: you, Chrysippus, do so too in business and in private life, but you leave off doing so in the lecture-room. What then? do you think philosophers should speak a different language from ordinary human beings? The learned and the unlearned may differ as to the values of things; but when the learned are agreed what each thing’s value is,—if they were human beings, they would adopt the recognized form of expression; but so long as the substance remains the same,—let them coin new words at their pleasure.</p>
