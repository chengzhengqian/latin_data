book <span class="italic">On Happiness,</span> in which a very considerable amount of importance is assigned to fortune; though if this be correct, wisdom alone could not guarantee happiness. This theory seems to me to be, if I may so call it, too enervating and unmanly to be adequate to the force and dignity of virtue. Hence we had better keep to Aristotle and his son Nico-machus; the latter’s elaborate volumes on Ethics are ascribed, it is true, to Aristotle, but I do not see why the son should not have been capable of emulating the father.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL040_405_a" id="target_note_LCL040_405_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Still, we may use Theophrastus on most points, so long as we maintain a larger element of strength and solidity in virtue than he <span class="innerMarginNote left">13</span> did.

Their successors are indeed in my opinion superior to the philosophers of any other school, but are so unworthy of their ancestry that one might imagine them to have been their own teachers. To begin with, Theophrastus’s pupil Strato set up to be a natural philosopher; but great as he is in this department, he is nevertheless for the most part an innovator; and on ethics he has hardly anything.
