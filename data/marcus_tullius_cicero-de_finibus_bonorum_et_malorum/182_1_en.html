while some are those which are objects of pleasure in every living creature, but in man are objects of the reason also<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL040_365_a" id="target_note_LCL040_365_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; those which are dependent on the reason are called honourable, beautiful, praiseworthy; but the former class are called natural, the class which coupled with things morally worthy <span class="innerMarginNote left">59</span> render happiness perfect and complete. They further hold that of all those advantages, which they who call them goods rate no more highly than does Zeno who says they are not goods, by far the most excellent is Moral Worth and what is praiseworthy; but if one is offered the choice between Moral Worth plus health and Moral Worth plus disease, there is no doubt to which of the two Nature herself will guide us; though at the same time Moral Worth is so potent, and so overwhelmingly superior to all other things, that no penalties or rewards can induce it to swerve from what it has decided to be right; and all apparent hardships, difficulties and obstacles can be trodden under foot by the virtues with which nature has adorned us; not that these hardships are easily overcome or to be made light of (else where were the merit of virtue?), but so as to lead us to the verdict that these things are not the main factor in our happiness <span class="innerMarginNote left">60</span> or the reverse.

The sentence will then run: ‘Things in accordance with nature, which the Stoics pronounce neither moral nor praiseworthy, (1) in plants excite none of the appetition of which we have often spoken, but (2) in animals excite volition, and particularly (3) in man excite the reason also (i.e. are the objects of rational choice).’</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL040_365_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
