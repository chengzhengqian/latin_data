Or would the consuls have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">89</span><span class="br"></span> been resolute to check him as praetor? But in the first place, had Milo been slain, he would have had consuls<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_107_a" id="target_note_LCL252_107_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who were his own creatures; and secondly, what consul could have dealt resolutely with the praetor, remembering that it was he who, as tribune, had cruelly persecuted consular merit?
