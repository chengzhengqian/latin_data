<p>M. Cicero alone replied; and though it had been thought best by certain persons that the ground of defence should be that Clodius’s death had been in the public interest—a line which M. Brutus pursued in the speech which he composed and published in Milo’s defence, though he did not deliver it—Cicero determined otherwise, on the ground that the man who could be condemned to the public good, could not also be put to death without a conviction. The accusers had insisted that Milo had plotted against Clodius; this was false, for the brawl had arisen fortuitously; Cicero took up this point, and asserted that on the contrary Clodius had plotted against Milo, and his whole argument turned on this assertion. It was clear, as has been pointed out, that no one had designed the encounter on that day, but that it had arisen by chance; it had begun with a slave brawl and had ended in murder. At the same time it was undeniable that each had often threatened the other with death; and though the fact that Milo’s retainers outnumbered those of Clodius cast suspicion upon him, at the same time Clodius’s men had been more lightly equipped and better prepared for battle than had those of Milo. When Cicero began to speak, he was greeted by yells from Clodius’s partisans, whom not even fear of the soldiers standing round could restrain; consequently he spoke with far less than his customary resolution.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_134_a" id="target_note_LCL252_134_a"><sup>a</sup></a> The speech which was actually delivered is also extant.
