amination? Appius. Who has brought them forward? Appius. From whom were they procured? From Appius. Unexceptionable rigour this, in all conscience! There is no legal right of examining slaves against their masters save to discover sins against the gods—such examination as was held against Publius Clodius. Clodius has indeed approached very near to the gods,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_73_a" id="target_note_LCL252_73_a"><sup>a</sup></a> nearer than when he forced a passage into their very presence, when his death is made the subject of as rigorous an inquiry as an act of sacrilege. Still, the intention of our ancestors was that a slave should never be examined against his master; not that it was impossible thus to discover truth, but because it was felt to be unnatural, and more deplorable even than the master’s death.

Did Clodius plot against Milo?” “He did.” Result—crucifixion, for sure. “He did not.” Result—a chance of liberty. What could be more infallible than this form of examination? They are haled off for torture without delay, and even then they are isolated and flung into separate cells, that none may hold communication with them. In this particular case, they had been in the custody of the prosecutor for a hundred days, and were then by the prosecutor himself produced. What could be more impartial or more unprejudiced than such a method of examination?</p>
