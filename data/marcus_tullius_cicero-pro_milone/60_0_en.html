<h2><span class="ac">Appendix to The Speech on Behalf of Titus Annius Milo</span></h2>
<p>From the Commentary of Quintus Asconius Pedianus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_124_a" id="target_note_LCL252_124_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span><span class="sc">This</span> speech was delivered on April 8 in the third consulship of Gnaeus Pompeius. When the trial was proceeding, troops were posted in the forum and in all the temples adjoining, a fact which we learn not only from this speech and from historians, but also from the work which Cicero entitles <span class="italic">On the Masters of Oratory</span>.</p>
<p>T. Annius Milo, P. Plautius Hypsaeus, and Q. Metellus Scipio supported their candidature for the consulship not only by lavish and unashamed bribery but also by gangs of armed retainers. Between Milo and Clodius there was a bitter feud; Milo was Cicero’s close friend and had devoted strenuous political efforts to his restoration, while P. Clodius cherished deadly hatred against Cicero after his return, and for this reason ardently supported Hypsaeus and Scipio against Milo. At Rome Milo and Clodius at the head of their gangs had often come to blows; both were equally determined, though Milo in the better cause. Moreover Milo was standing for the consulship, and Clodius for the praetorship, of the same year, and Clodius fully realized that, with Milo as consul, his praetorship would be maimed.</p>
