O ye immortal gods, a brave man<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">104</span><span class="br"></span> indeed, and one whose life, gentlemen, you may well preserve! “Nay, nay!” he cries, “’tis well that <span class="italic">he</span> has paid a penalty that he deserves; let me, if fate so ordains, submit to one that I deserve not!” Shall this man, born for his country, die anywhere
