the man? He did slay him. Whether he was justified or not? But that has nothing to do with the torturer; it is facts that are extorted upon the rack, questions of justification in the courts.</p>

<p>XXII. What is proper matter for a trial we track down here; what you wish to elicit by torture we admit. In asking why he emancipated them, instead of asking why he bestowed upon them a reward so inadequate, you show what a poor hand you are at taking an opponent to task. Our friend Marcus Cato here, whose utterances <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">58</span><span class="br"></span>
are invariably bold and resolute, said at an uproarious public meeting, which albeit was calmed by his impressive personality, that slaves who had defended the life of their master were in the highest degree deserving not merely of liberty but of the most generous rewards. For what reward can be adequate to slaves so devoted, so loyal, and so true, to whom their master owes his life?—although even this does not count for so much as that he owes to those same slaves that he has not glutted with his blood and his wounds the eyes and passions of a relentless foe; and should he have failed to emancipate these, he would have had to hand over to the torment the preservers of their master, the avengers of crime, and the averters of death. In all his calamities there is nothing which my client bears with such cheerfulness as the fact that, should anything happen to himself, these at least have had this well-merited reward paid to them.</p>

against Milo—those, I mean, which have just been held in the court of the temple of Liberty. What slaves are their subjects? Do you ask? Those of Publius Clodius. Who has demanded their examination?
