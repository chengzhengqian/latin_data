to the case. A separate vote<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_23_a" id="target_note_LCL252_23_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was taken, on the motion of somebody or other,—I need not expose the misdemeanours of everybody,—and so the rest of the Senate’s resolution was invalidated by means of a suborned veto.</p>
<p>“But,” it may be objected, “Gnaeus Pompeius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
by his motion stated his opinion both on the fact and on the rights of the case; for he introduced a measure dealing with the affray which took place on the Appian Way, in which Publius Clodius was slain.” What then was this measure? That an inquiry should be held, of course. What then is to be the subject of inquiry? Whether the deed was committed? But no one questions it. By whom then? But it is patent. He saw, then, that even where the fact was admitted, a plea of justification might still be sustained. Had he not seen that the man who admitted the deed, as he saw that my client admitted it, had a chance of acquittal, he would not have ordered an inquiry to be held, nor would he have given you the letter of weal for the recording of your votes along with the letter of woe.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_23_b" id="target_note_LCL252_23_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For my part I think that Gnaeus Pompeius, so far from making a damaging pronouncement against Milo, has definitely laid down what it is that you ought to consider in coming to a decision; for by meeting confession of the fact not by a penalty, but by permission to plead, he has declared his opinion that it is the circumstances and not the fact of death that should be inquired into. No doubt he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>
will soon tell us himself whether the course which he took on his own initiative was taken as a tribute to the merits of Publius Clodius or to the emergency.</p>
