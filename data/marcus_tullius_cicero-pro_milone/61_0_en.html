brawl with Clodius’s slaves. Clodius looked back threateningly at the disturbance, and Birria transfixed him with a javelin. A pitched battle began, and several others of Milo’s party ran up. The wounded Clodius was carried into a tavern near Bovillae. As soon as Milo learned that Clodius was wounded, realizing that it would be more dangerous for himself should he survive, but that should he be slain it would be a great relief, even if a penalty should have to be faced, he ordered that he should be turned out of the tavern. The leader of his slaves was M. Fustenus. So the skulking Clodius was dragged forth and finished off with many wounds. Since Clodius’s slaves had either been slain or, grievously wounded, were in hiding, his corpse was left in the road, until Sex.

Clodius the scribe at their head, carried Clodius’s body into the Senate-house, and set it on fire by means of the benches and tribunals and tables and
