Do you move as strangers in this city? Are <span class="italic">your</span> ears wool-gathering? Do they dwell aloof from the rumours which are bruited among our populace—as to the laws (if laws they should be called, and not rather firebrands for the city’s doom and plagues for the scourging of the commonwealth) which he intended to inflict upon us, and with the mark of which he hoped to brand us all? Out, Sextus Clodius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_43_a" id="target_note_LCL252_43_a"><sup>a</sup></a> out with that portfolio of laws which you snatched, we are told, from the house, and bore safely like a Palladium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_43_b" id="target_note_LCL252_43_b"><sup>b</sup></a> from the weapons and the welter of the night, that you might bestow it as a precious boon and an engine of tribunician power on anyone you might find who was ready to hold the tribunate under your conditions!. . .

You cast out of doors Publius Clodius’s gory corpse; you flung it into the highway; and there, robbed of its images, its train of mourners, its pageantry and its panegyric, you charred it on a pile of ill-starred timber, and left it to be mauled by the dogs that haunt the dark! Doubtless it was a shameful act; but since it was upon my foe that you vented your ruthlessness, though I cannot praise, I certainly have no right to-cherish anger against you.</p>
