Obviously none; if my client plotted against Clodius, let him not go unpunished; if Clodius against Milo, let us be acquitted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_41_a" id="target_note_LCL252_41_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

was Clodius who laid a plot against Milo? Dealing as we are with a monster of such reckless impiety, it is enough to demonstrate that he had a great inducement to kill Milo, and great expectations and great advantages held out to him in the event of his death. Accordingly let Cassius’s famous test, “Who stood to gain?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_41_b" id="target_note_LCL252_41_b"><sup>b</sup></a> be applied to the characters now before us; only let us remember that no self-interest will ever drive the good man into crime, while the bad man is often impelled thereto by one that is but trivial. And, as a matter of fact, Clodius, by Milo’s death, did stand to gain not only that his praetorship would <span class="italic">not</span> fall under a consul who would render him powerless for ill, but also that his praetorship <span class="italic">would</span> fall under consuls with whose connivance, at least, if not with their aid, he hoped that he might have full scope for the mad schemes which he entertained—men who, so at least he reasoned, would not be anxious to check his efforts if they could, since they would be sensible of the deep debt they owed him, and who, even if they wished, would perhaps scarce be able to crush that audacity in the vilest of scoundrels which time had by now brought to its full vigour.</p>
