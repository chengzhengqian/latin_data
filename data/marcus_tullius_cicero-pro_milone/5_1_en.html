there anyone who is unaware that when inquiry is held into a murder, the act is either categorically denied, or that its commission is defended as right and justified?—unless indeed you hold that Publius Africanus was mad when, on being maliciously asked in a public meeting by Gaius Carbo, tribune of the plebs, what was his opinion concerning the death of Tiberius Gracchus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_15_a" id="target_note_LCL252_15_a"><sup>a</sup></a> he replied that he thought he had been deservedly slain.
