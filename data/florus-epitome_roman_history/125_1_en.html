<p class="noindent">driven by violence, Marius might seem to have acted justly, but that he disgraced his cause by cruelty. But returning at enmity with gods and men, he directed his first onslaught against Ostia, a city dependent upon Rome, and her foster-child, which he laid waste with impious destruction. Soon afterwards the city was entered by four detachments distributed under the command of Cinna, Marius, Carbo and Sertorius. When all Octavius’ troops had been dislodged from the Janiculum, immediately, at a given signal, they wreaked their fury in the slaughter of the leading citizens with even greater cruelty than even in a Carthaginian city. The head of the consul Octavius was displayed on the <span class="italic">rostra</span>, that of Antonius, an ex-consul, on Marius’ own table. Caesar and Fimbria were butchered at the household shrines of their own homes. The elder and younger Crassus were slain in the sight of one another. Baebius and Numitorius were dragged through the forum on the hooks of the executioners. Catulus saved himself from the insults of his enemies by swallowing fire. Merula, the priest of Jupiter in the Capitol, bespattered the visage of the god himself with the blood from his veins. Ancharius was stabbed in the presence of Marius himself, because, forsooth, when he saluted him, Marius had not stretched out to him the hand which was to decide his fate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL231_251_1" id="target_note_LCL231_251_1"><sup>1</sup></a> All these deaths of senators were the result of Marius’ seventh consulship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL231_251_2" id="target_note_LCL231_251_2"><sup>2</sup></a> between the 1st and the 9th of January.
