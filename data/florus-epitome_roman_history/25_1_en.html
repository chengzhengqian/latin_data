<h3><span class="sc">X. The Sabine War</span></h3>
<p>15. <span class="sc">After</span> the Latins they attacked the race of the Sabines, who, forgetful of the relationship formed under Titus Tatius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL231_51_1" id="target_note_LCL231_51_1"><sup>1</sup></a> had become as it were infected by the spirit of the Latins and had joined in their wars. During the consulship of Curius Dentatus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL231_51_2" id="target_note_LCL231_51_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the Romans laid waste with fire and sword all the tract of country which is enclosed by the Nar, the Anio and the sources of the Velinus, and bounded by the Adriatic Sea. By this conquest so large a population and so vast a territory was reduced, that even he who had won the victory could not tell which was of the greater importance.</p>

was more formal and older, having been accompanied by the surrender of all their possessions. Thus the Romans entered upon war with the Samnites as though they were fighting for themselves.</p>
<p>The district of Campania is the fairest of all regions not only in Italy but in the whole world. Nothing can be softer than its climate: indeed it has spring and its flowers twice a year. Nowhere is the soil more fertile; for which reason it is said to have been an object of contention between Liber and Ceres. Nowhere is the coast more hospitable,</p>
