They were willing to surrender if conditions were imposed to which men of spirit could submit. But since Scipio desired a complete and unqualified victory, they were first reduced to the necessity of rushing into the fray resolved to die, after they had first gorged themselves with, as it were, a funeral banquet of half-raw flesh and <span class="italic">caelia</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL231_155_1" id="target_note_LCL231_155_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a name which they give to a local drink made from corn. Their intention was perceived by the general, and so, ready though they were to die, no opportunity was given them of fighting. When famine pressed hard upon them—for they were surrounded by a trench and breastwork and four camps—they begged the general to allow them to engage him, so that he might slay them like men, and, when their request was refused, they determined to make a sortie.

Despairing, therefore, of escape and in a revulsion of rage and fury, they, at last, under the leadership of Rhoecogenes, made an end of themselves, their families and their native city with the sword, with poison and with a general conflagration. All glory to a brave city, a city blessed, so it seems to me, even in its misfortunes; for it loyally helped its allies and with so small a force withstood for so long a period a people which was supported by the resources of the whole world.</p>
