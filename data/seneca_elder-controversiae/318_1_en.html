you kill the father, you ignore the child, you have no fear of your lover.—Slaves and freemen offered themselves one at a time to the child for identification; I stood in front of all,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_107_1" id="target_note_LCL464_107_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the assassin hid behind his lover.—What have I done wrong before this? Whose wife have I seduced? If I <span class="italic">had</span> done so, I should be able to kill a man—but not my father.—My witnesses are good.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_107_2" id="target_note_LCL464_107_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—I fear for this child, who is in the power of another.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_107_3" id="target_note_LCL464_107_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—Look at my father’s body: how grievous the wound is, how deep the sword was plunged in!

We are freer to do what we cannot see. The atrocity of the deed may be no less; but it arouses less fear in the doer.—If I killed my father, I have to clean up the whole bed;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_107_5" id="target_note_LCL464_107_5"><sup>5</sup></a> if I am a parricide, I can spare no-one.—I cannot boast of avenging my father; my brother has got in first with that.</p>
