grandfather, he will end up following his brothers. Stop looking for him; if you find him, you will lose him—in such a way that you can never find him.” And then: “His grandfather took him—in case his step-mother took him.” And then: “The only one of his sons the father is looking for is the one who is safe.” Glycon expressed this idea once, though his<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> expression shows bad taste: “This child will be lost when he is found.” Montanus’ trouble is that he spoils his own epigrams by repetition; because he is not content to say a thing well once, he in the end does not say it well at all. For this and other reasons that make the orator comparable with the poet, Scaurus used to call Montanus the Ovid among orators; for Ovid too is incapable of leaving well alone. Not to give many examples of what Scaurus called “Montanisms,” I will content myself with one: when Polyxena had been led away to be sacrificed at the tomb of Achilles, Hecuba says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_325_1" id="target_note_LCL464_325_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent5">“Even the ashes of the buried man</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Fight our family.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">That might have sufficed him. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent3">“We felt our enemy, even in his grave.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">He wasn’t satisfied even with this, but went on:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">“I was fertile—for Achilles.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Scaurus was quite right in saying that to know how to stop is as important a quality as to know how to speak.</p>
