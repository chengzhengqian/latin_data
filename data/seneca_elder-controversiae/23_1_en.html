want it, and you want it today, too.” And by means of this figure<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_47_1" id="target_note_LCL463_47_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of his, he said everything that should lead him to want it. “Why then are you disinheriting me? I suppose because you are angry that your duty<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_47_2" id="target_note_LCL463_47_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has been snatched away from you.”</p>
<p>Latro brought up a straightforward <span class="italic">colour</span> for the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> youth. He had something to boast of, not to apologise for. “I could not tolerate that cruel sight. Do you think that I just forgot your wrong to me? I forgot everything; my consciousness dimmed, my feet were unable to support my body as they should, my eyes dulled in sudden darkness. Otherwise, if I had been in my right mind at that moment, should I have waited to be asked?”</p>
<p>Fuscus introduced, as he often did, the <span class="italic">colour</span> of religion: “Nature moved me, piety moved me, and the mutability of human fortune, so clearly exemplified. Fortune seemed to stand before my eyes and say: ‘Those who do not support their own go hungry.’”</p>

He did not beg: he knew how one ought to behave towards a son—he gave me orders to feed him. He recited the law to me—a law that I have always supposed covers an uncle too.” Then he said: “I gave less than I ought to have given to a father—but as much as I could slip past him who forbade me.”</p>
