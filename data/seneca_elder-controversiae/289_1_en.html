<p>I often tell you that Cestius, being a Greek, was 27 handicapped by a lack of Latin words, while overflowing with ideas. And so, whenever he ventured on some more extravagant sweep of description, he would get stuck, especially when he had set himself to imitate some great genius. This is what happened in our present <span class="italic">controversia.</span> In his narration, when he was describing how his brother was handed over to him, he was satisfied with this one unhappy vignette: “It was dead of night, and all singing things, judges, were silent beneath the stars.” Julius Montanus, who was a friend of Tiberius and an outstanding poet, said that Cestius had intended to imitate Virgil’s description:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">“It was night, and over all the earth tired crea-</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">tures,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Birds and beasts, were held in deep sleep.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_49_1" id="target_note_LCL464_49_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Virgil, however, had (according to Montanus) been fortunate in <span class="italic">his</span> imitation, for he had rendered for the better those excellent lines of Varro:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">“Dogs had ceased to bark, the cities were still,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent1">Everything was settled in the quiet calm of night.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_49_2" id="target_note_LCL464_49_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Ovid used to say of these verses that they could have been much better if the last part of the second line were cut out and it finished thus:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent4">“Everything was of night.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_49_3" id="target_note_LCL464_49_3"><sup>3</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
