even your ashes; she harries your sister—it is all she can do.—What can she know, at her age, except her brother?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_333_1" id="target_note_LCL464_333_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—May it be to her credit in your eyes that her father praises her, and that she is accused by a mother of such a character.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mento.</span> Don’t you pity her? She is more unhappy<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
than her brother; he, it is true, had a stepmother, <span class="italic">she</span> has a mother who is worse than a stepmother.—“My daughter is my accomplice.” <span class="italic">I</span>
began to be the victim, the step-mother the torturer.—Woman, you have got what you wanted; alone of all men, I felt a step-mother more when I lost her.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_333_2" id="target_note_LCL464_333_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="sc">Porcius Latro.</span> I had a son so good that even a step-mother could have loved him—but he happened on one capable of hating even her daughter.—Has it come to this, that parricide is a girl’s crime?—So if she does not understand the magnitude of the matter, does that make her suitable for parricide?—“But she is a poisoner’s daughter.” If we are going to review her parents, why should she not be thought to resemble her father, who loves her, rather than her mother, who hates her? Still, I don’t reject the idea of seeing in her the image even of her mother; <span class="italic">she</span> at this age was neither step-mother nor poisoner.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_333_3" id="target_note_LCL464_333_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="sc">Albucius Silus.</span> I married a woman as yet unbesmirched<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>
by any talk; and it is not surprising she was innocent then—she was only a child.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_333_4" id="target_note_LCL464_333_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="sc">Blandus.</span> Even if she is wicked, surely she resembles her mother—and so has to do a poisoning before a parricide.—“My daughter is my accomplice.”
