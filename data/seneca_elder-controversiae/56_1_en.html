Should he have, is a point of development, which everyone varies as he so wishes. But Latro organised it thus: he ought, even without his father’s orders, to have killed a hero’s wife taken in adultery; he ought, seeing that his father <span class="italic">did</span> order him, even if the father was himself capable of killing; he ought, because his father ordered him and could not act himself.
