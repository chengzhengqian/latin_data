dishonourable to receive a price that a father was willing to pay?—Stand by me, my sense of duty! If I have lived purely and innocently, ensure that this man who hates my hands should feel the need of them.—I thought the letter was being opened slowly.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_159_1" id="target_note_LCL463_159_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—This is what was needed to complete the legends of an age packed with our crimes, that it should be told how someone released by pirates was imprisoned by his father.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Blandus.</span> This man who has nothing to live on,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> how much he pays for the mutilation of the man who killed your tyrant! What do you say, you plunderer of your son, you mentor of pirates, who are willing to buy a cruelty not even a pirate will sell?</p>
<p><span class="sc">Romanius Hispo.</span> “A father to the pirates, good health.” That is just what you wrest from your son.
“I will give double.” What need? I could have got my release cheaper. “To cut off his hands.”
The pirates were staggered, and when they let me go they said: “Tell your father that pirates do not have everything for sale.”</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mento.</span> Up to now, judges, I have pleaded as though for <span class="italic">my</span> hands. But I must confess it: it was for <span class="italic">your</span> sake they were spared. I show you, my country, what was put in safe keeping with the pirates; these are <span class="italic">your</span> hands, sent safe to you. Do what you will. All I ask is that if they sinned you should give them to any other to be bound. If you give them to <span class="italic">him,</span> he will bind them the way he freed them—he will cut them off.</p>
