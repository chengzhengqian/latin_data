remark,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_261_1" id="target_note_LCL463_261_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Latro said something the schoolmen learnt off as a sort of intoned tag: “Do you not see how a torch unbrandished is dim, but when shaken it gives out its fires? Men are softened by leisure, iron is eaten away by disuse, and takes on rust. Sloth brings forgetfulness.” Ovid wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">“I have seen flames grow as a torch is shaken,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And again die when no-one brandishes it.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_261_2" id="target_note_LCL463_261_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>Well, while a student, Ovid was held to be a good<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> declaimer. At any rate he declaimed this <span class="italic">controversia</span>
before Arellius Fuscus far more cleverly,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_261_3" id="target_note_LCL463_261_3"><sup>3</sup></a> to my mind, except that he ran through the commonplaces in no fixed order. I remember that the following sayings of his were applauded: “The whole trouble is getting you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_261_4" id="target_note_LCL463_261_4"><sup>4</sup></a> to let husband and wife love each other. You <span class="italic">must</span> allow them to swear once you allow them to love.—What do you think our oath was by? It was <span class="italic">you</span> whose name aroused our awe. In case of perjury, she called down on herself an angry father, I an angry father-in-law. Spare me, father: we were not forsworn.—Look at the unbridled passion that sweeps our censor away! His complaint is that anyone apart from himself is dear to his daughter. Why is it that he summons her away from her fondness? Good god, how did <span class="italic">he</span> love <span class="italic">his</span> wife?—He loves<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> his daughter—and disinherits her. He is grieved that she should have been in danger—and takes her away from the man she says she cannot live without,
