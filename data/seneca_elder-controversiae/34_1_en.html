When you begged to be excused the visitor’s embraces, you may have got everything else you wanted—but you had to pay a kiss.—One doesn’t buy a priestess’ <span class="italic">maids</span> from a brothel: in a priestess’ presence men abstain from obscenity.—It is not without reason that a lictor attends a priestess: he removes a prostitute from her way.—It is incredible that pirates abstained<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> from lust, men brutalised by every sort of cruel deed, for whom right and wrong are a jest, plunderers by land and sea, whose profession is to attack the property of others, in arms. Such men, cruel even to look at, used to human blood, carrying before them chains and bonds destined to weigh heavily on their captives—could you turn <span class="italic">them</span> aside from their desires? Amid so many greater crimes, the deflowering of a virgin is for them an act of innocence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_69_2" id="target_note_LCL463_69_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But the brothel took you in. To this place flows a crowd of all filthy and dangerous men: no-one comes there to play the judge.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_69_3" id="target_note_LCL463_69_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Yet everyone sympathised with your tales? Everyone believed them? No-one was to be found in such a throng of comers and goers who wanted to make a joke of your ill-fortune?—Do <span class="italic">you,</span> having suffered such things, even if you have lived as innocently as you claim, believe the gods exist?—“I suffered nothing,” she says. This is enough for a bride—but not enough for a priestess.
