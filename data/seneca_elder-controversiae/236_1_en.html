was defeated in battle at Pharsalus, yet lived. Do you think your shipwreck worse than that? Crassus lived, though he had lost not his private fortune but the state’s.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_473_1" id="target_note_LCL463_473_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—Fortune has taken everything from you—but it has left hope. Remove men’s hopes—and no-one who has been defeated will resort to arms again, no-one who has failed in business will have the heart to pursue further gain, no-one who has been shipwrecked will survive. Hope is the last solace of adversity.—It was in order to live that you swam.—I pitied you, and had thought only for your danger; I did not bother about the fire or your bereavement—or if I did I remembered you had gone on living after those events.—I didn’t think he intended to die: he had chosen a place where he could be interrupted.</p>
