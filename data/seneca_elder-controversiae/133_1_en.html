<p>A ravisher won over the father of the girl he had raped; he is unable to win over his own, and accuses him of insanity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_267_2" id="target_note_LCL463_267_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

On the other hand, he cannot promise to forgive him, because that would spoil the <span class="italic">controversia</span> (cf. §11). Many of the declaimers therefore hint at the father’s real feelings, while making him persist in his refusal. Quintilian cites another of Latro’s epigrams of this kind: “‘Will you kill me, then?’ Yes, if I prove capable of it” (cf. <span class="italic">Decl.</span> p. 375.21 <span class="italic">seq.</span> Ritter), as well as one of Gallio’s from §6.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL463_267_4').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
