Syriacus was attacking this <span class="italic">colour</span> in a second speech, he said a good many clever things, including this: “The adulterer was taken into the bedroom by prosecuting counsel, and into bed by defence counsel.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_245_1" id="target_note_LCL463_245_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And he pretty well walked off with the case. Here is an example of Syriacus’ clever devices and pretty repartee in the same case; in the first speech he did not give a narration of the facts, but merely argued, saying he would prove that the woman had been surprised in the bedroom with a slave. Bruttedius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span> Niger in his speech reproached Syriacus with not having explained the case, and kept on pressing the point why it was unclear how the slave had been seduced and brought to the bedroom. When Syriacus replied, he said: “First of all, we did not study under the same teachers. You had Apollodorus, who likes always to have a narration. I had Theodorus, who doesn’t always insist on one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_245_2" id="target_note_LCL463_245_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Then as to your complaint, Niger, that I didn’t narrate: I made <span class="italic">you</span> do it.” And against Stertinius Maximus, who had attacked him despite their being old friends, he said: “For twelve years I was in your circle: tell me what I did wrong in your house. But this is typical of your type. You call the ending of slavery an insult. We are to your liking as long as we are of use to you.” I couldn’t leave out these witticisms of Syriacus, received as they were with great applause, once I recalled them.</p>
