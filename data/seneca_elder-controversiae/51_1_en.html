lot of abuse for that epigram. “Did they call her back like a chariot-and-four? You used that image before, as well, by saying that she too had left the prison.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_103_1" id="target_note_LCL463_103_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And after a lot more, he finally added something we all disapproved: “It was by that sort of carelessness that your father<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_103_2" id="target_note_LCL463_103_2"><sup>2</sup></a> lost his army.” In telling off the son, he slandered the father.</p>
<p>Aietius Pastor spoke this <span class="italic">controversia</span> before Cestius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> when he was already a senator. He thought this <span class="italic">colour</span> the best: her body had been made so hard by drugs that it bounced on the rocks without being harmed. Cestius picked on him, and said: “Is this why I encourage my audience to go and hear others? In my eyes an athlete and a consumptive are equally bad.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_103_3" id="target_note_LCL463_103_3"><sup>3</sup></a> He also spoke against Albucius, who had at much the same time said in this <span class="italic">controversia</span> “harder than the rock,” and a great deal against Julius Bassus, who had said: “a virgin good at leaps.” I remember Junius Otho introducing a stupid <span class="italic">colour</span>, something the less tolerable because he published books of <span class="italic">colours</span>: “Perhaps she got ready for her punishment, and, from the start of her misbehaviour, took thorough lessons in falling.”</p>
<p>Pompeius Silo also tried out this <span class="italic">colour</span>: “One<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> owes a certain respect to priestesses, even after condemnation. We blushed to remove any of the condemned girl’s clothes.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_103_4" id="target_note_LCL463_103_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
