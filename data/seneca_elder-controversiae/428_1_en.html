<h3><span class="sc">The Daughter Involved in the Poisoning of the Step-son</span></h3>
<p>A woman who poisons shall be tortured till she reveals her accomplices.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_327_1" id="target_note_LCL464_327_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>A man lost his wife, by whom he had a son, married again and raised a daughter by his new wife. The youth died; the husband accused the step-mother of poisoning him. On conviction she was tortured and said her daughter was her accomplice. The girl is to be executed. Her father defends her.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Fulvius Sparsus.</span> Wicked woman, step-mother even to her own daughter, she could not even die without killing. Even among gladiators the worst position for a victor is to have to fight a dying opponent. Fear no adversary more than one who cannot live—but can kill.</p>
