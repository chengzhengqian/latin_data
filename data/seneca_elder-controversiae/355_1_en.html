bashful and having a countryman’s sense of shame, had not been up to confessing.

<p>Cornelius Hispanus: “I didn’t want to deprive her<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> of a husband, but to give her a more respectable one. So compassionate a girl deserves not to be thought to have married a ravisher.”</p>
<p>Romanius Hispo said that the companions who had egged him on by night surrounded him<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_181_1" id="target_note_LCL464_181_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and said: “This is not the girl you raped—it was another.” He was afraid of acting wrongly by the girl he <span class="italic">had</span> raped.</p>
