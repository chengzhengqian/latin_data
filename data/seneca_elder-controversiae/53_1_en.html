<p><span class="sc">Porcius Latro.</span> All I did was to wake up my deceivers.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> Alas: how long they lay there after I had caught them!—<span class="italic">I</span> not disinherit you? I wish I could kill you.—O, bitter is the memory of my bravery! Sad the recollection of my victory! I was once a soldier, loaded with spoil from the enemy: but I could only abuse those who had deceived me.—I am the only husband who has ever failed both to let his deceivers go<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_107_1" id="target_note_LCL463_107_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and to kill them.—“Why do you laugh?” I said. “I have hands”—and I sent for my son.—Are <span class="italic">you</span> a hero’s son?—you cannot draw a sword.—Even in my maimed state I could only be taken—in at home.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_107_2" id="target_note_LCL463_107_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—But as far as I could I struggled, opposing my maimed body to them.—My deceivers left stained with blood—but it was only mine.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cornelius Hispanus.</span> O, here is someone who deserves a chaste wife—or an unchaste one, so long as he can hold arms!—I invoke you, Republic: <span class="italic">you</span> have my hands.—Anyone might suppose either that I had no son or that my son had no hands.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cestius Pius.</span> He was conceived—we shall know<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> the identity of the father when I catch the adulterers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_107_3" id="target_note_LCL463_107_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—I never supposed that, while the republic was not in danger, a hero could feel the loss of his hands.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Marullus.</span> I chased my deceivers right to—the threshold.—Alas, I ran to get my sword as though I had hands.</p>
