<p>On the father’s side, Latro said there was need of a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> defence rather than of a <span class="italic">colour</span>. Varius Geminus defended the actual deed: great men had married freedwomen. “Marcus Cato married the daughter of one of his farmers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_139_1" id="target_note_LCL464_139_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ‘But <span class="italic">she</span> was freeborn.’ I reply: it was Cato who married her—and there is more difference between you and Cato than there is between a freedman and a farmer.

<p>Pompeius Silo used this <span class="italic">colour</span>: His estate had been exhausted as a result of the wrongs done under the tyranny; he had no dowry to give her.</p>
<p>Argentarius wanted it to be thought that he had acted with the girl’s approval. “She seemed to favour him. Certainly she should have done.”</p>
<p>Gavius Sabinus used a <span class="italic">colour</span> that involved, as far as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> possible, diminishing the father’s dignity and acknowledging his lowness. “She could escape the more easily from violation because no-one was casting an eye on our house.
