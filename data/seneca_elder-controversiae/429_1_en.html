<p><span class="sc">Vibius Gallus.</span> Madness is most violent at the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> point of death, and its last despair drives a mind to fury. Some beasts snap at the very shaft that hits them, and rush on amidst their own wounds at the author of their death. When his chance of release is removed, a gladiator will pursue naked the opponent he had fled under arms. People falling down a cliff take with them not only what pushed them but anything in their way. And, by a feeling natural to a mind that is despaired of, the dying find it very pleasant to have a companion in death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_329_1" id="target_note_LCL464_329_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="sc">Votienus Montanus.</span> In avenging my son, I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> showed where I could be hurt most.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_329_2" id="target_note_LCL464_329_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—This lie is like a poisoning!—In a step-mother parricide is incredible; can you believe it of a sister? I have no fears that anyone will believe of a sister what I could scarcely prove in a step-mother.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_329_3" id="target_note_LCL464_329_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—I acknowledged the daughter born to me, as a hostage who would ensure peace. I said to myself: “Remembering she is a mother, she will forget she is a step-mother.” In fact, she remembered she was a step-mother and forgot she was a mother.—“My daughter is my accomplice,” she says. After such a speech you would imagine the tortures were relaxed—she has become like the torturer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_329_4" id="target_note_LCL464_329_4"><sup>4</sup></a>—Did the sister give her brother poison? How long we had to struggle to get people to believe a step-mother gave it to her step-son!—Step-mother, you have got what you wanted; I am sorry now that I had you convicted.</p>
