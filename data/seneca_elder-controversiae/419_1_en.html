hear your step-mother say: “Who are you? They’ve brought you back again then, runaway?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_309_1" id="target_note_LCL464_309_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—I had a daughter who was fertile—yet he has only one son.—How
kindly she divided up her offspring! When one son was born, she said: “This is my son.” A second son was born, and she said: “This is his father’s.” A third was born, she said: “This is his grandfather’s.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_309_2" id="target_note_LCL464_309_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—When he was looking for his son, some people advised me: “Keep quiet—he deserves to be kept out of the house.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_309_3" id="target_note_LCL464_309_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="sc">Cestius Pius.</span> What motive had I, an “uncontrollable old man,” to take him away? Had I killed his brothers?—Forgive me if I tell you only of my daughter’s last instructions: she was the one member of my family I saw dying.—I had a daughter; of all my family I have to say: “I had.”—He wandered the streets in a dirty mourning toga; everybody pitied him—I even heard people saying: “What? This child has no mother? No father? No grandfather?”</p>
<p><span class="sc">Arellius Fuscus Senior.</span> You are beholden to my<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> daughter for three sons, to me for one. Let him be reared at my house. What are you afraid of? Not being let in when you come to visit?—So far my story<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_309_4" id="target_note_LCL464_309_4"><sup>4</sup></a> has given me pleasure; now I must tell of fortune—or a step-mother.—When the child saw me, he clung to my embrace; I kissed him sadly, asked him about his brothers. While I was questioning him in tears, I found I had arrived home.—I ask that my case be not weakened by the fact that the son I took away was the only one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_309_5" id="target_note_LCL464_309_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
