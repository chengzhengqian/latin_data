presents he gave her—if there is anything at all that he did <span class="italic">not</span> give her. Why go through it in detail? I bought everything for you all over the world: but, alas, I the husband, with all my wealth, am swamped beneath the presents of a seducer. “Let her be sole heir.” Why so? “You know,” she says. “He has written down the reason: Because I could not corrupt her, though I asked once, twice, a third time.” We are indeed born in a fortunate and as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> they say a golden age! Can it be that even men who go in search of unchaste women pay tribute to the chaste ones? “Let her be sole heir of all my property, all my money, because she could not be seduced, because she could not be won over despite so many attempts, because she guarded her chastity so faithfully.” Suppress for a moment the name of the writer; would you not suppose this was the will of a <span class="italic">husband?</span> Look! Suppose that, suspecting no infamy on the part of my wife, loving and loved (or so I believe), I want to get my will made just before my death and write a codicil to go with my bequests to her: I must borrow the language of her lover’s will.</p>

Is none of <span class="italic">them</span> chaste? That, I suppose, is why he wanders round foreign cities with such riches, ready to pay tribute to unknown chastity. Where he was born there were no chaste women, and where he did his business everyone was a prostitute; there was a gap in his will—in his wanderings he was looking for a chaste heir.</p>
