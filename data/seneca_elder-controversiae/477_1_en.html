a handsome beggar: but let the rest of his limbs be useless, so that the cruelty of Fortune, savaging the gifts it gave, may touch the hearts of men more poignantly. This is how this tyrant without a bodyguard distributes human disasters.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Vibius Gallus.</span> Look at the wretches, their limbs<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> weakened and wasted by I know not what disease, hands cut off, eyes plucked out, feet broken. Why do you shudder? This is the way he shows his pity.—So many limbs smashed—to fill one belly; and—strange prodigy!—a whole man gets fed, cripples do the feeding.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Albucius Silus.</span> “They would have perished.” Don’t they suffer more in surviving like this than if they had perished? “They would have perished.” Ask the fathers which <span class="italic">they</span> preferred.—“Let this one’s eyes be torn out, that one’s hands be amputated.” What if one of these is destined to be a hero?

<p><span class="sc">Triarius.</span> “They would have perished.” I think<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> you know by experience that we are not cruel: yet every one of us, when holding out alms to these wretches, prayed they might die.—Get up, cripple: he tries, and falls over. Get up, dumb man. But why stir yourself—you cannot beg. Get up, blind man; but you don’t know to whose knees you go.
