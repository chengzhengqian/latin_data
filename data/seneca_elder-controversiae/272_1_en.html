<h3><span class="sc">The Man who was Released by his Son, the Pirate Chief</span></h3>
<p>A man whose wife had died, and who had two sons by her, married again. He convicted one of the youths privately for parricide;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_15_2a" id="target_note_LCL464_15_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> he handed him over to the other son to be punished, and the brother put him on a disabled boat.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_15_3" id="target_note_LCL464_15_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The youth drifted into the hands of pirates, and became a pirate chief. Later the father set out abroad and was captured by the son and sent back to his country. He disinherits his other son.</p>

This makes an exact parallel with the case of Tarius, who tried his son privately for plotting against his life and invited Augustus to be a member of the tribunal (Sen. <span class="italic">Clem.</span> 1.15). It seems clear from <span class="italic">Clem.</span> 1.15.7 (unless Seneca is being merely rhetorical) that it was still at this date theoretically open to the father to impose the traditional penalty by drowning in a sack.
