charged against me.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_373_1" id="target_note_LCL464_373_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Whatever may happen, I shall not stop looking for the murderer—perhaps I have already found him.—. . . when suddenly, in the middle of the city, my father—why do you look at me, why watch what I am going to say?—was removed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Arellius Fuscus.</span> Those of my rank cannot go in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> great state, wearing bright clothes—<span class="italic">that</span> is possible for the rich: it is enough for us to be alive.—Since the body was found unrobbed, I don’t know who the assassin was: but whoever he was, he resembled a rich man in despising loot.—“Why do you follow me in public?” A wicked crime has been committed: we, a rich man and a poor man, have gone along the same road.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_373_2" id="target_note_LCL464_373_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

My father was murdered in mid-city, though the laws still stood. Who could even tell the story without tears?—I shall not take off these dark clothes unless I find someone I can put them on to.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_373_3" id="target_note_LCL464_373_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—Who killed my father?
