<p>However, Junius Otho was good at declaiming<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">34</span><span class="br"></span> <span class="italic">controversiae</span> which needed to be spoken allusively. And so I recall that he shone particularly on behalf of the slave (?) charged with adultery,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_243_2" id="target_note_LCL463_243_2"><sup>2</sup></a> against whom the eloquent Vallius Syriacus had sworn he brought no false charge.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_243_3" id="target_note_LCL463_243_3"><sup>3</sup></a> The case was like this: a man attested that he had caught an attractive youth, a slave of his, with his wife in her bedroom, and on this pretext divorced his wife.

She had not tolerated it; the husband had got angry, and threw himself on the slave as though he were a seducer. On this topic he made use of a word in as bad taste as his <span class="italic">colour</span>: he said the servant was sent for to give a “sop” to his master’s lust.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_243_5" id="target_note_LCL463_243_5"><sup>5</sup></a> When
