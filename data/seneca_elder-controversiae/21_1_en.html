<p>Latro’s points were these. He made a distinction between law and equity.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_43_1" id="target_note_LCL463_43_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Can he be disinherited? Should he be? On the question, Can he be disinherited, he raised the following points: Was it necessary for him to support his father, and can he be disinherited for something he did because the law compelled him to? This he subdivided as follows: Does a disinherited son cease to be a son? Does someone who, besides being disinherited, has been adopted by another, cease to be a son? Even if he was still a son, should everyone who has failed to support his father be punished? Suppose he were sick, in prison, a captive?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_43_2" id="target_note_LCL463_43_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Can the law accept an excuse on the part of a son? Could it accept it in this case? On the question, Should he be disinherited, he subdivided thus: Even if that man did not deserve to be supported, was this man nevertheless right to support him? Next, Was he worthy of support?</p>
<p>Recent declaimers, following a Greek lead, have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> added a question before these two: Can an adopted son be disinherited? Cestius used this point. He added another: If even an adopted child can be disinherited, can he be disinherited for a fault that was known to the adopter before the adoption? But this is rather relevant to the heading of equity, and a piece of <span class="italic">treatment</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_43_3" id="target_note_LCL463_43_3"><sup>3</sup></a> rather than a question.</p>
<p>Gallio doubled Latro’s first point thus: It was permissible
