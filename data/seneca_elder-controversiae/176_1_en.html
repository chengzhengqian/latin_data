well-known question that he usually scorned:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_353_1" id="target_note_LCL463_353_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Extravagance is not generally made a reproach to a father, any more than avarice or choler; it is not a father’s faults that are normally accused but his sickness. Even if something apart from madness can be made a reproach to a father, can luxury? “No. Otherwise,” he said, “you are allowing sons to disinherit their fathers; but the law allows a, <span class="italic">father</span> to disinherit his son for spending money out of another’s pocket—<span class="italic">this</span>
