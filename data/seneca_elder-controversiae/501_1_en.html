tolerable than Metrodorus’: “Don’t paint me the Trojan women or Niobe.”—“Lay on the fire: he hasn’t yet given me the Prometheus-look.”</p>
<p>Triarius said: “Your groans aren’t worthy of the anger of Jove—yet.”</p>
<p>Haterius, more sanely, said: “His expression doesn’t yet fit the story.” Also: “Parrhasius, let the tortured man survive, so as to keep to the pattern in every detail.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_473_1" id="target_note_LCL464_473_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>But if you want to hear something beyond which lunacy cannot go, Licinius Nepos said: “If you want to punish Parrhasius as he deserves, let him paint himself.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_473_2" id="target_note_LCL464_473_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Much more stupidly, Gargonius, explaining why Parrhasius had painted the punishment of Prometheus, said: “While Olynthus burned, was I not to hate the originator of fire?”</p>
