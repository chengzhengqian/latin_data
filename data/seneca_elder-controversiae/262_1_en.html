praise marriage, tell the story of Lucretia, write about <span class="italic">her</span> death before swearing by your own.—You indeed deserve every punishment if you find anything more agreeable than your office.—“It is sweet”: the phrase is clear-cut, despatched from the very heart of a woman who has had experience—and, what is more, enjoyed it.—A woman is unchaste if she wants sex, even if she has not had it.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The other side:</span> One verse is made subject of a charge against her—and not even the whole verse.—“She
should not write poetry.” There is a lot of difference between reproaching and punishing.—No-one
can be convicted of unchastity unless her body
has been violated.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_525_1" id="target_note_LCL463_525_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—Do you imagine that poets write what they really mean?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_525_2" id="target_note_LCL463_525_2"><sup>2</sup></a> She lived modestly and strictly; she wore no finery that was over-luxurious, had with men no dealings that were over-free. I have only one crime to confess for her—she has talent.—Why should she not envy Cornelia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_525_3" id="target_note_LCL463_525_3"><sup>3</sup></a> or Cato’s mother, or those who give birth to priestesses?</p>
<p><span class="italic">By the way:</span> Varius Geminus said in the presence of Caesar:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_525_4" id="target_note_LCL463_525_4"><sup>4</sup></a> “Caesar, those who venture to speak in your presence are unaware of your greatness; those who do not venture are unaware of your kindness.”</p>
