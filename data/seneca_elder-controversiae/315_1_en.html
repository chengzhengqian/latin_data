<h3><span class="sc">The Five-year-old Who Testified Against the Agent</span></h3>
<p>A man lost his wife, by whom he had a son, remarried and raised a son by his second wife. He had a good-looking agent in his household. The step-mother and step-son quarrelled frequently, and he ordered his son to move; he rented a house next door. There was a rumour of adultery between the agent and the mother. One day the father was found killed in his bedroom, his wife injured and the party-wall dug through.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_101_1" id="target_note_LCL464_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The relations decided to ask the five-year-old
son who had slept in the same room whom he recognised as the assassin; he identified the agent by pointing at him. The (elder) son accuses the agent of murder, while the agent accuses the son of parricide.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_101_2" id="target_note_LCL464_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
