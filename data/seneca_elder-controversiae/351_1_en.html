<p><span class="sc">Vibius Gallus.</span> Where are those of you who said: “It makes no difference to you, confess”?—He confesses—because you thought it more respectable to marry a ravisher.—“Let any child born within ten<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_173_2" id="target_note_LCL464_173_2"><sup>2</sup></a> months be my heir.” Is that a denial?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_173_3" id="target_note_LCL464_173_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—Rise, young man, and say: “I raped her, I violated her.” Begin to know what you do not know.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_173_4" id="target_note_LCL464_173_4"><sup>4</sup></a>—Are you surprised he doesn’t believe you?

<p><span class="sc">Publius Asprenas.</span> I don’t know at which trial my<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> adversary has behaved more outrageously. At the first the aim of his plea was that he should pay no penalty at all for his rape. In this one, his aim is himself to choose which of the two penalties determined by the law he wants to pay; for he acknowledges that formerly he preferred going unpunished to marrying a wife, but that now he prefers marrying a wife to dying. Previously he tried to subvert the law of rape, now he wants to turn it to his own ends; he begs the counsel, he begs the judge, everyone rather than the girl who was raped.—If only he wasn’t freed from fear by the knowledge of how merciful his judge<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_173_6" id="target_note_LCL464_173_6"><sup>6</sup></a> is!—He cried that he was innocent, that he did not refuse to die if he had done
