fluous as well as what tells against myself. Everything is superfluous in a declamation: declamation is superfluous.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_387_1" id="target_note_LCL463_387_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I will tell you what I feel. When I speak in the forum, I am <span class="italic">doing</span> something. When I declaim I feel, to use Censorinus’ excellent phrase of zealous candidates for local office, that I am struggling in a dream. Again, the two things are quite different:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> it is one thing to fight, quite another to shadow-box. The school has always been taken to be a sort of school for gladiators, the forum as an arena—hence the word tiro<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_387_2" id="target_note_LCL463_387_2"><sup>2</sup></a> for the man who is going to make his first speech in the courts. Come on, bring your declaimers
into senate and forum! With their surroundings they will change their character. They are like bodies used to the closet and the luxury of the shade, unable to stand in the open and put up with rain and sun.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_387_3a" id="target_note_LCL463_387_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> They scarcely know where they are:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_387_4" id="target_note_LCL463_387_4"><sup>4</sup></a> they are used to being clever at their own rating. There is no point in trying to test an orator amid these<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> childish pursuits. You might as well judge a helmsman on a fish-pond. I should take more pains in my defence (pleading that I was not born for such things) if I didn’t know that Asinius Pollio, Messala Corvinus and Passienus (now our leading orator) are rated as declaimers below Cestius or Latro. Do you think this the fault of the speakers—or their hearers? <span class="italic">They</span> are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
