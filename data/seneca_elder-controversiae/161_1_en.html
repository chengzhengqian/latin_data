a husband who had such preoccupations?—Still the tyrant raged: wives were being tortured in the sight of their husbands, mothers were regretting their fertility.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Romanius Hispo.</span> What do you want children <span class="italic">for</span>?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> So that you can have someone to leave your estate to? Ungrateful man, surely you <span class="italic">have</span> an heir while this woman lives?—He left out no variety of torture; all her limbs were mangled, all her joints wrenched; her body was torn with whips, burnt with fire, twisted by rackings. Surely you will pardon a poor feeble woman if I say: “She is worn out.”</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cornelius Hispanus.</span> He hesitated—no exhortation could spur him on to kill the tyrant. When you had seen his wife, you could surely forgive his fears.—Constantly
the tortures are varied. Fires that had been extinguished are relit. They call for the torturer whose attentions have made husbands betray wives.—“Suppose I make a bargain with you. If I give nothing away, will you make me a present of the five years?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_323_1" id="target_note_LCL463_323_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—Why do you boast?—as though it weren’t easier to kill a tyrant than to endure his tortures.—He is bound to his wife by a double service: he was not killed, and he did the killing.—He scorns the barren woman: it was he who made her barren.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Junius Gallio.</span> The tyrant pressed on. “Rack<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> her. That part is still available. Apply the fire. The blood is already dry <span class="italic">there.</span> Cut her, whip her, tear her eyes—make sure she no longer pleases her husband as a breeder of his children.”</p>
