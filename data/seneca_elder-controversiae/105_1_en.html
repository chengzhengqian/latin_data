regard a single hour spent in mollifying your anger as worth three times any inheritance.—That you want to be rid of me in this manner is the sole thing in you that I cannot love as I should.—What am I to do when I am adopted? Shall I do well to speak<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_211_1" id="target_note_LCL463_211_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of his sons?

Shall <span class="italic">I</span> take over your fineries, with the prospect that, if I misbehave myself there, your father will throw me out without mine taking me back?—What is there for me either to deny or to excuse? You are not reproaching your son with madly reckless expenditure, shameful amours, luxurious clothing, or tippling. If you can’t accuse him of these things, take some hints from your friend’s notebook: “sodden with exotic perfumes, crippled by lusts, to please women stepping along more delicately than a woman,” and all the other things that point to madness rather than sound judgement. Disinheriting is a talkative business.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_211_3a" id="target_note_LCL463_211_3a"><sup>3</sup></a>—How
I love you, poverty—it is thanks to you that I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> am innocent. I have no accuser: in fact, unluckily I even have someone to praise me, and a man whom not everyone pleases (I prefer that to saying: “everyone displeases him”).—Your house has no abundance of sons to lean on, no crowd hovers at your side; you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_211_4" id="target_note_LCL463_211_4"><sup>4</sup></a> have no plenitude of heirs behind your front-door, nor is there another after me for you to keep for yourself. And even if there had been, you ought not to have given me away—you had seen even the gods
