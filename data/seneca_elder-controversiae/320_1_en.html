two defendants and “transferring” a charge as soon as they had repelled it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_111_1a" id="target_note_LCL464_111_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Among these was Cestius. This is not always a good idea. Particularly for the one who has the weaker case, it is inexpedient to come to close grips; details that are not matched together are more easily hidden.</p>
<p>In this <span class="italic">controversia</span> there are not two but three<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> accused; for along with the agent goes the stepmother. And this was why he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_111_2" id="target_note_LCL464_111_2"><sup>2</sup></a> said that at least on the side of the son one should place accusation first, because he had one charge to refute, two to bring—for
adultery and murder.</p>
<p>Any awkward points on either side require not a <span class="italic">colour</span> but argumentation; so to keep my account short, I shall pass over the <span class="italic">colours.</span></p>
<p>On the step-mother’s wound there were some nice remarks, some foolish—or rather, many foolish. First for the pretty ones:</p>
<p>Fuscus said: “Her skin was scratched by a light<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> wound; you would suppose it the work of a lover’s hand, not a step-son’s.”</p>
<p>Passienus said: “Did the hand that neither wall nor father could withstand wound you so slightly?”</p>
<p>Varius Geminus said: “Give my witness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_111_3" id="target_note_LCL464_111_3"><sup>3</sup></a> a sword—<span class="italic">he</span> will strike more boldly.”</p>
<p>Cestius, after describing the superficial nature of the wound, said: “You would have harmed me<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_111_4" id="target_note_LCL464_111_4"><sup>4</sup></a>—if you could have brought yourself to harm your lover.”</p>
