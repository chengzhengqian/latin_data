<p><span class="sc">Junius Otho Senior.</span> Fear change! He<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_33_1" id="target_note_LCL463_33_1"><sup>1</sup></a> too lost none of his possessions before he lost his son.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Arellius Fuscus Senior.</span> Will you not open your<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> home to me? I am no troublesome guest: I bring with me only one old man. This was the fault, father, with which I pleased <span class="italic">you.</span>—There approaches an old man I do not know.
