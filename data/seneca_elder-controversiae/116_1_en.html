Think what that means. Is he to reproach one who is doing him so signal an honour, his father’s friend, while saying nothing against the man he is having to flee?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_233_2" id="target_note_LCL463_233_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Yet even those declaimers who committed themselves to abstaining from abuse did not keep to their promises very well; some were lured on by the delights of epigram, and could not resist.
