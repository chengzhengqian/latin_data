What was the result there? I was judged the younger.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_405_1" id="target_note_LCL464_405_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Mento said: “I am afraid I may become cheaper in my father’s eyes for this very reason;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_405_2" id="target_note_LCL464_405_2"><sup>2</sup></a> we all know how much he loves glory.”</p>
<p>Triarius used this <span class="italic">colour:</span> “I wanted to give way to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> you at the trial, so that you might be thought not to have ordered it but to have won—and I did give way. I pleaded my case cursorily; but let it be known that the son does not yield because he didn’t think himself his father’s equal.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_405_3" id="target_note_LCL464_405_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Nicetes said in this <span class="italic">controversia:</span> “If Nature had given us back my grandfather to be present at that trial, would he not have said:</p>

<span class="line indent2">My son and grandson quarrel over bravery’”;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent3">“‘far better he than his father.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_405_4" id="target_note_LCL464_405_4"><sup>4</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Scaurus put this idea differently: “O, if my grand-<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> father were present at the trial, how glad he would be to see even our discord! He would have shouted to me: You should not yield—<span class="italic">he</span> never yielded to me.”</p>
<p>Labienus, declaiming the father’s part, said: “I don’t want to live with my adversary—that is a favour
