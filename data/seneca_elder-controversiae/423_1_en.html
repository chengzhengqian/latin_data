<p>This, then, was Latro’s <span class="italic">colour</span> for the father, to say<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> that even when his first wife was alive, he had not got on well with his father-in-law, while after her death the father-in-law had been an acknowledged enemy. When the child was ill, the father-in-law came abusing him, shouting, his words and intentions abominable. He had been advised by his friends not to admit a man who came not to do his duty by his grandsons but to insult his son-in-law and make him odious: after all, when his grandsons had been well, he had never condescended to come and see them.
