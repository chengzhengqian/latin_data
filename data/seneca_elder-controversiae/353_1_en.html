taken back, should it be now? Here came a defence of the young man, who denied that he had violated the girl.</p>
<p>Fuscus changed the order of questions and increased<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> their number. His first was: Can a ravished girl choose more than once? “She can; the law does not add how often she is to choose, but merely says what she is to choose from. It says ‘either this or that’—it doesn’t go on to say: ‘not more than once.’” The opposite view is: “The law orders you to choose one or the other; if you choose death today, you will do something unprecedented—you will have chosen both.” “Even if it is not permissible to choose more than once, I haven’t yet chosen; a choice is a choice when it is made legally—this choice was not. If the praetor had been absent, would you call it a choice? In fact, there was no ravisher. That is no choice—it is mere words.” Was the choice ratified by the previous trial? The ravisher says: “The judges had to say whether the choice was to stand or not. It was decided that it should—let it so stand.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_177_1" id="target_note_LCL464_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “No,” says the girl, “for what was at stake was whether I had a right over the ravisher. It was judged that I have. I must use it. I cannot appeal to the law before I have a ravisher.” Fuscus’ last question was one of equity: Should the choice stand?</p>
<p>Passienus divided this last part like this: If the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> young man acted with bad intentions towards the girl in denying the rape, in order to escape marriage, does he deserve to undergo a second time the chances of a choice he has refused once? Then: <span class="italic">were</span> his intentions bad?</p>
