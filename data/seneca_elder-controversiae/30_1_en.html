can go so far against you—the rest is obscure. Why do you summon me to<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_61_1" id="target_note_LCL463_61_1"><sup>1</sup></a> your room, to your lecherous bed? The subject here is the chastity of a priestess.—“Nobody took away my virginity.” But everyone came intending to take it away, everyone went as though they had succeeded. What sort of a priestess is it—I ask you—whose chastity is on sufferance?—When you fled, stained with blood, from that brothel, if anyone had met you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_61_2" id="target_note_LCL463_61_2"><sup>2</sup></a> . . .—If your mother had been a prostitute, it would go against you; and because of you I should not grant your children a priesthood.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marullus.</span> We can tell she has been in a pimp’s house—she is a wheedler; we can tell she has lived with pirates—she is stained with blood.—“Nobody touched me.” Give me the pimp’s accounts: you will find the entries balance.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_61_4" id="target_note_LCL463_61_4"><sup>4</sup></a>—What if an obstinate man visited you? Or someone who found your very virginity an attraction? Or someone who brought a sword to make sure you could not refuse?</p>
