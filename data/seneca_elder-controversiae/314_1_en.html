stumbled: “She is the more to be wept for because she cannot weep,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_99_1" id="target_note_LCL464_99_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and again: “My mother has no tears—but many reasons for them”—as though the blind usually don’t weep.</p>
<p>remember one Crispus, a declaimer of the old days, in the <span class="italic">controversia</span> about the hero who keeps his third son at home after his first son had lost his sight killing a tyrant and the second his hands in battle, say: “Arise now, living corpses, beg on your father’s behalf. But why do I mock my sons? One cannot see from whom he is to beg, the other has nothing with which to beg.”</p>
<p>Many have found themselves deceived by the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> rhythm of a well-sounding epigram. Thus I recall Porcius Latro—in order to reproach the schoolmen with this carelessness in listening, particularly because Triarius used to please many in the schools, and take them all in, by his arrangement of pretty word-cadences—finishing off a passage in some <span class="italic">controversia,</span> when he was flowing along with splendid and passionate diction, with these words: “Among the tombs there are memorials.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_99_2" id="target_note_LCL464_99_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And when the schoolmen shouted their applause, he weighed into them, as was only right, and made sure that in future they expressed their appreciation even of good sayings rather more slowly, in their fear of a trap.</p>
<p>Glycon said: “Hurry, mother, take hold of your child. Wretched woman, you cannot see him even if you win.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_99_3" id="target_note_LCL464_99_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—She says: “If you don’t feed me, stay here—to bury me.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_99_4" id="target_note_LCL464_99_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
