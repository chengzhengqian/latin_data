Taking the part of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> youth and handling the topic of adoption, Latro said: “Now he is by adoption being raised from the depths and grafted on to the nobility”—and more to this effect. Maecenas signed to Latro that the emperor was in a hurry and that he should finish the declamation off now. Some thought this mere malice on the part of Maecenas; he made sure not that Caesar failed to hear what was said but that he noticed it. However, in the reign of the blessed Augustus there was such freedom of speech that, pre-eminent though Agrippa then was, he did not lack critics of his low birth. He had been Vipsanius Agrippa, but the name Vipsanius, being a sign of his father’s humble origin,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_315_1" id="target_note_LCL463_315_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he had got rid of, and he was now called merely Marcus Agrippa. When he was defending a client once, an accuser said: “Marcus Agrippa—and what comes between”—he meant Vipsanius to be understood. And someone also said: “Hurry round! Agrippa is in for a beating. Reply please—both Marcuses.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_315_2" id="target_note_LCL463_315_2"><sup>2</sup></a> The blessed Augustus, I feel, deserves admiration if such licence was permitted in his reign; but I cannot feel any sympathy for those who think it worth losing their head rather than lose a jest. Latro <span class="italic">did</span> deserve sympathy—he couldn’t even excuse himself for his slip: nothing is crueller than to offend in such a way that apology will give even greater offence.</p>
