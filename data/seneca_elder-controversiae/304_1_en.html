<p>I don’t imagine you’re demanding a division, this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> being a conjectural case.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_79_1" id="target_note_LCL464_79_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the “conjecture” it involves is unusual and two-fold; two-fold not, as generally happens, because there are two defendants, when we have to prove one guilty, or two charges, where we have to prove one so that it can serve as a proof for the other, as when we say that a woman has been an adulteress to make people believe she is therefore also a poisoner.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_79_2" id="target_note_LCL464_79_2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="italic">This</span> two-fold conjecture concerns one and the same man; for we are enquiring whether he prepared the poison to kill himself or his father.</p>

<p>Albucius used the <span class="italic">colour</span> for the youth that it wasn’t poison. “As I thought my father hated me, I wanted to test out his attitude, to see how he would take the idea of my death; that was why I held the poison openly and in such a way that my father would catch me.” Arellius Fuscus used the same <span class="italic">colour</span>, but in a
