Votienus Montanus added this question:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> Did Cimon repay Callias? “I did,” he says. “I married your daughter, and your daughter became daughter-in-law of Miltiades.

When someone hopes or plans something from it, it is no service—it is a scheme.” He developed
