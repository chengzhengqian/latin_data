<p><span class="sc">Publius Vinicius.</span> You must choose as priestess<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> someone who will either remain decent, as she always was, or would feel the punishment if she stopped being decent.—What sort of boldness is this, girl? Even if we didn’t fear for ourselves, you ought to dread for yourself. Everyone’s conscience is subject to the power of gods quite otherwise than to our judgement: we have seen only your overt actions, they the secret too.—I should call you unfit for the priesthood if you had merely passed through a brothel.—Will the lictor<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_63_1a" id="target_note_LCL463_63_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> ahead of her remove the crowd from <span class="italic">this</span> woman’s path?

Do you want to hear the outcome of the sale? A pirate was the seller, a pimp the buyer, a brothel the place to which she was taken.—You were led off to a place where you could do nothing more upright than to die.—You asked for money more eagerly than you ask for a priesthood.—She says: “Fortune compelled me to suffer this; all must pity me.” <span class="italic">I</span> pity you, girl, but we don’t make priestesses of women who need pity.
