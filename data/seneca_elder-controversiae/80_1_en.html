<p><span class="sc">Alfius Flavus.</span> As yet I do not know what sort of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> father to pray for. A rich one? He maims me. A poor one? He chains me. Neither process is kind to my hands.—“I will give double if you cut off his hands.” You had a son<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_161_1" id="target_note_LCL463_161_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who was less cruel.</p>
