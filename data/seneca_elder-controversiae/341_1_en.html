traitor no guard.—Why did the enemy spare you? You are our general’s father, you carry gold, and you are not an ambassador.—If I say to you: “Wait till ambassadors are sent, your son will be returned to you by the state,” you will say: “A father’s emotions brook no delay; I am carried away by the loss I feel for my son; even if I cannot ransom him alive, I shall at least ransom him dead. No enemy was ever so hard that he could not be moved by a father’s tears.” Even if I forgive you for going so soon, I shall object<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> to your coming back so quickly.—Tell us what he told you—or did he perhaps not want to speak to his father?—“Beware treachery.” This is what he meant: make sure no-one goes out at night without the guards knowing, no-one goes to the enemy without the knowledge of the state, no-one returns from the enemy camp weighed down with gold.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_153_1" id="target_note_LCL464_153_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—There is nothing missing in the information. If you have any queries about the treachery, the general will tell you; if you have any about the traitor, the ambassadors.</p>
