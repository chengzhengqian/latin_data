He said that three things have particularly to be prized in an aspiring priestess: chastity, innocence, luck. “The soldier showed how chaste she is; the judge how innocent; her return how lucky. Indeed, we have in a way an advance choice<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_83_1" id="target_note_LCL463_83_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for the priesthood given by heaven itself, however much these people reproach her with having been a captive, then served a pimp, finally answered an accusation.

You may put her in a brothel: even through this she managed to carry her chastity away untouched. She was in a shameful, vicious place; the pimp set her up as a prostitute, the people venerated her; each visitor paid more<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_83_4" id="target_note_LCL463_83_4"><sup>4</sup></a> to preserve her chastity than he had brought along to violate it.
