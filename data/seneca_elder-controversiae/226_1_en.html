lieve I can do nothing. All the doctors say she can’t be saved, and after being mistaken about you they have been all the more careful this time. I’m not so knowledgeable as I seem; one needs eminent teachers—but when I was a student I had been disinherited.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_453_1" id="target_note_LCL463_453_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You may ask how then I cured <span class="italic">you.</span> It was not as a doctor that I did you good, but as your son. You were suffering from missing me; you liked everything you received from my hands.

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The other side:</span> I cannot but grieve, cannot but weep: is it for this you saved my life?—There was once a case of an enemy curing a wound he had inflicted, just because no-one else could cure it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_453_5" id="target_note_LCL463_453_5"><sup>5</sup></a>—
