marriage, not my father.—Let him have the honour of being made a dowry slave,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_121_1" id="target_note_LCL464_121_1"><sup>1</sup></a> let him be guard to his mistress.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_121_2" id="target_note_LCL464_121_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—Do you regard as sane a man who preferred acting like a tyrant to acting like a slave?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_121_3" id="target_note_LCL464_121_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—Our

you then, sister, commit adultery if you want to have respectable children?—He has made himself like the tyrant, his daughter like the women who were raped, his freedman like the slaves who were crucified.—The master has allowed his slave more licence than the tyrant did.—A man who makes such a match is either madman or tyrant.—Who can believe that a daughter should have had to pray that the tyranny should not end, that her father should not return from exile?—If I ask my father what the worst outrage during the tyranny was, he will reply, if he is sane: “The marrying off of mistresses to their slaves.”</p>
