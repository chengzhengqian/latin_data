to believe on this point? A harlot, a pimp, some pirates? That is the sum total of the witnesses.—A priestess would have merited the reproach of the high priest if she had ransomed you out of a brothel.—All the mob of lechers throngs together and rushes to the new whore.—You will at least confess that your chastity is on sufferance: so many gladiators, so many young men, so many drunks entered your room; were they all unarmed, before the soldier came?—<span class="italic">I</span> say that she was a prostitute. She says she was a beggar<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_73_1" id="target_note_LCL463_73_1"><sup>1</sup></a> too.—I owe the chastity of my budding priestess to the fact that she is also a murderer.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Junius Gallio.</span> The law is importunate. It admits<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> to the priesthood no woman not of inviolate good fortune—as well as chastity. It enquires into a woman’s ancestors, her body, her life. <span class="italic">You</span> had better see to it how you can satisfy so pernickety a law. You were captured by pirates, you walked among slaves and murderers in the cramped quarters of the privateer. <span class="italic">We</span> shall see what liberties might have been taken with you by savage enemies, lustful barbarians, licentious owners. I am sure, judges, that, hearing of the savagery of these barbarians, you favour her, and hope that she may exchange her slavery for a priesthood as soon as possible.—The pirates looked after her as men would who proposed to sell her to a pimp. The pimp looked after her as a man would who proposed to force her to offer herself in those ranks, eat at the same table, live in a place where you see sex even if you do not experience it.—
