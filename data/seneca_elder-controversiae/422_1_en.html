be taken before the one drawn from the circumstances: Can one litigate with a grandfather in the name of a grandson? “No—any more than with a father or with a mother in the name of a son. Nature has rights of its own, and the only difference between father and grandfather is that a grandfather may keep his grandsons safe, the father may even kill his sons. You cannot,” he went on, “sue me as though I were an outsider, saying: ‘What have you to do with him? Who are you?’ After all, if I die intestate, your son will be my heir. If I go mad, he will be my restrainer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_315_1" id="target_note_LCL464_315_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Some rights are given to us not by law but by nature. A grandfather can strike his grandson if he does something naughty and rags about too violently in his childish play, without anyone suing him for damages.”</p>
<p>After dealing with the point that he was allowed to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> do violence in order to do good, then with the point that it <span class="italic">was</span> to the good of the child, Gallio posed his last question: Should this grandfather be forgiven for something he did when carried away by his feelings for his grandson? Here he dealt with the topic of how wicked it was for him to be condemned for this.</p>
<p>Latro put the last two questions differently, and got more in. Even if he did do violence, can he nevertheless be convicted if he acted from good motives? Next: <span class="italic">Did</span> he act from good motives? He said that the father’s dispute with the grandfather turned on motive, the father asserting that the grandfather acted not to save his grandson but to slander the present wife as a poisoner, and the father as a poisoner’s catspaw to whom it was wrong to leave custody of his own children.</p>
