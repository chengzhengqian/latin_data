kill a guilty brother? Here Geminus said: “It was not allowed, I should not, I could not.” Was the man he failed to kill in fact innocent? Geminus said a pretty thing here, after he had started a full defence of the brother, as though it was he who was on trial: “Someone will say: Do you defend him so late in the day? I could not do it sooner; this is the first time the matter has been brought before the courts.” Finally: Did he punish him sufficiently even if he was guilty?</p>
<p>The greatest orators and the greatest declaimers<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span>
were undecided about the <span class="italic">colour;</span> should any attack be made on the step-mother? Passienus, Albucius and, beside the orators, a great party of recent declaimers went into the no lobby. There <span class="italic">were</span> some who did inveigh against her, and others who, without open assaults, employed hints and figures. This displeased Passienus, who said it was more shameful and intolerable to smear a step-mother than to accuse her. Some could only keep control of their opening remarks, then got carried away by the onrush of their eloquence. However, it is more excusable to come on a bad <span class="italic">colour</span> unawares than to make a deliberate passage to it.</p>
<p>Latro introduced an honourable<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_39_1" id="target_note_LCL464_39_1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="italic">colour</span> in his narration, and used it throughout his speech: “I could not kill.” After describing with great spirit the son staggering and fainting at the thought of killing his brother, he said: “Step-mother, look for another charge against your step-son; <span class="italic">this</span> man is incapable of parricide.”</p>
<p>Cestius used a different <span class="italic">colour.</span> “We were passing 21 by our mother’s tomb. He began to call on her shades.
