<p>Marcellus said: “So if <span class="italic">he</span> did a parricide, must <span class="italic">I</span> do one too?” He also spoke the epigram I mentioned above:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_43_1" id="target_note_LCL464_43_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “Brother, you have . . .”</p>
<p>Varius Geminus, too, said: “I didn’t want to kill.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> I said to myself: our step-mother has made an excellent division of her hatred between her step-sons; she has attacked each in a different way, reproaching one with parricide, and enjoining parricide on the other.” And he used this figure to defend him in his narration: “I asked my brother before which praetor he had pleaded his case. ‘None,’ he said. ‘Who was the accuser?’ ‘No-one.’ ‘Who was the witness?—or rather witnesses, for a single one isn’t believed even on a lesser charge.’ ‘No-one.’ ‘Who passed sentence on you?’ ‘No-one.
