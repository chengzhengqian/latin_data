its desire to get rid of the heir that had been foisted on it.</p>
<p>Latro made the last question his usual one: Even<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> if he was wrong to refuse to be adopted by a rich man, should he not be forgiven if he acted in a good spirit towards his father? Then: <span class="italic">Had</span> he acted in a good spirit towards his father? In this question the good role is that of the young man who loves his father and prefers him to wealth.

father to let him be given for adoption to a rich man. What a good case such a father will have! He will say. . .” Then—having in this manner declaimed a <span class="italic">controversia</span> that had <span class="italic">not</span> been set—he made his transition thus: “If <span class="italic">that</span> son has a bad case, <span class="italic">I</span> have a good one”: and he proceeded to compare his own case with the other.</p>
