<p>However, Ovid rarely declaimed <span class="italic">controversiae,</span> and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> only ones involving portrayal of character. He preferred <span class="italic">suasoriae,</span> finding all argumentation tiresome. He used language by no means over-freely except in his poetry, where he was well aware of his faults—and enjoyed them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_265_1" id="target_note_LCL463_265_1"><sup>1</sup></a> What can make this clear is that once, when he was asked by his friends to suppress three of his lines, he asked in return to be allowed to make an exception of three over which they should have no rights. This seemed a fair condition. They wrote in private the lines they wanted removed, while he wrote the ones he wanted saved. The sheets of both contained the same verses. Albinovanus
Pedo, who was among those present, tells that the first of them was:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent2">“Half-bull man and half-man bull,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_265_2" id="target_note_LCL463_265_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">the second</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“Freezing north wind and de-freezing south.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_265_3" id="target_note_LCL463_265_3"><sup>3</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">It is clear from this that the great man lacked not the judgement but the will to restrain the licence of his poetry. He used sometimes to say that a face is the more beautiful for some mole.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_265_4" id="target_note_LCL463_265_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
