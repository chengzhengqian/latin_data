<p>There is also a variety of bad taste<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_263_1" id="target_note_LCL464_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that looks for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> bitter words in order to make the facts appear worse. Thus in this <span class="italic">controversia</span> Licinius Nepos said: “The accused was condemned for the law’s sake, and died for a brothel’s.” A remark of Saenianus, too, has its own kind of insanity. Saying that executions ought not be carried out by night, and after a long description: “<span class="italic">Now</span> not even victims<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_263_2" id="target_note_LCL464_263_2"><sup>2</sup></a> are killed.”</p>
<p>The Greeks tried their hand at this <span class="italic">controversia</span> too.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">29</span><span class="br"></span> In it Nicetes said: “But when they heard there was a party, they began to dispute.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_263_3" id="target_note_LCL464_263_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Euctemon said: “Everyone thought he had been released.”</p>
<p>Glaucippus, a Cappadocian, having described the luxurious banquet as being unworthy of the dignity of a praetor, added: “Now I will describe the carousal too.” The same thing was more elegantly put by Adaeus, after a description of the night feast: “What a loving revel!”</p>
<p>Nicetes said: “‘I have never seen a man killed.’ If the city is lucky, you won’t in future.”</p>
<p>Artemon, at the same point, had a different epigram: “‘I have never seen a man killed.’ Woman, there is no need of a debauch.”</p>
<p>Glycon said: “When the prisoners were told: ‘There is a party and a prostitute and high jinks,’ one poor chap shouted: ‘Take me—I was unjustly condemned.’”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_263_4" id="target_note_LCL464_263_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
