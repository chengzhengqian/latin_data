tell that he was less at home with this type of material rather than less suited to it. In this <span class="italic">controversia,</span> declaiming before the son of Lucius Lamia, he produced the epigram: “The father has turned out worse than the tyrant—the slave worse than himself.”</p>
<p>Many tried to get an epigram out of the documents of the slave’s purchase.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_143_1" id="target_note_LCL464_143_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Albucius said: “Produce me the documents. What is this? A father has got a son-in-law by deed of purchase.” Triarius said: “‘He<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> is not a runaway or a vagrant.’ Then if the vendor is not to be trusted, we have a runaway for a son-in-law?”
Blandus said: “Let us go over the documents of title again. ‘He is free from thefts and guilt.’ Such is the praise accorded to our son-in-law.”
Gallio said: “He is free of thefts and guilt.” . . . Sparsus said: “Show us the documents. What have we to do with such a son-in-law? His former master guaranteed he was no runaway. I congratulate the progeny: they will not have a runaway for their father.” Varius Geminus said: “‘He is no vagrant.’ I add that he is no runaway, that he is free of guilt and thefts. Have I removed any of your son-in-law’s
claims to nobility?” Pollio said he used to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span> be amused because the declaimers decided he could only be a bought slave.</p>
<p>You must be feeling surprised, I imagine, that in this <span class="italic">controversia</span> all the declaimers remained in their right minds. But in fact they did not. Mamilius Nepos, encouraging the freedman to divorce his sister, said: “Do <span class="italic">us</span> a service: <span class="italic">you,</span> manumit my sister.”
