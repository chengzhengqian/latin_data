axes, blood: who can think of a feast amidst all this?—“I have never seen a man killed.” Did you then see everything else under the magistracy of Flamininus?</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pompeius Silo.</span> It would have been shameful for a whore to make a fine nobleman—one who had held such high office—lenient: <span class="italic">she</span> made him cruel.—“I have never seen . . .” Go on to say, please: “and I shan’t be able to see it when someone else is praetor.”</p>
<p><span class="sc">Albucius Silus.</span> But if anyone, judges, wants me<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> to tell of the praetor’s cruelty, how many besides this man he slaughtered, how many innocent men he condemned, how many he shut up in prison, I promise that I shall satisfy such an enquirer: in one party I shall unroll the story of the accused and his praetor-ship.—In his province he organises a banquet. The feast is lavishly arranged with splendid appointments; silver cups are set off by gold ones. What more need I say, judges? The province felt the preparation of that banquet, to its cost.—A man is hauled from the prison and taken to the praetor’s party; the whore smiles on the poor dazed wretch. Rods are produced, and the victim of sadism is slaughtered before the table and before the gods. Alas, you have made a game out of the terror inspired by the empire of Rome. In sadistic practices you have surpassed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> every tyrant! You alone find pleasure at dinner in the groans of the dying; this was the final touch to the feast.—I see reclining together the love-sick praetor, and a whore greedy for a death; the whore rules the praetor, the praetor the province.—They place there a man in chains; seeing the drooping eyes of that praetor, and thinking that he is being released
