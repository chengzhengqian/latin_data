“His disdain is unbelievable. When the expression pleased, he shouted: ‘Stay like that!’”</p>
<p>Spyridion made the Romans look decent speakers:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> he was much dottier even than <span class="italic">our</span> lunatics. He wanted it to be thought that vultures flew up to Parrhasius’ picture. He was lured by a pretty story<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_475_1" id="target_note_LCL464_475_1"><sup>1</sup></a> into a shameful epigram. For it is related that Zeuxis (I think it was) painted a boy holding a bunch of grapes, and because the bunch was so realistic that it even made birds fly up to the picture, one of the spectators said the birds thought ill of the picture: they would not have flown up if the <span class="italic">boy</span> had been a good likeness. They say Zeuxis erased the grapes and kept what was best in his picture, not what was most like. Spyridion thought vultures come as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> naturally into a temple as sparrows or doves; for he said: “<span class="italic">Your</span> picture deceived animals that eat flesh.”
But I don’t want the Romans to be beaten at anything. Murredius will restore the day. He said: “Paint Triptolemus, who ploughed the breezes with a team of dragons.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_475_2" id="target_note_LCL464_475_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Among those who said something in bad taste on Prometheus, Apaturius too claims a place. For he said: “Would that fire had been stolen and given back to the gods!”</p>
