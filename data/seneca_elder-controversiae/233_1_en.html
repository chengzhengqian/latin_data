That is no longer in effect, this still continues.—“<span class="italic">I</span> didnot use force—someone else<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_467_1" id="target_note_LCL463_467_1"><sup>1</sup></a> did.” The man who applies force himself and the man who makes use to his own profit of force applied by another are equally deserving of punishment.—This
