be: “I received no benefit,” or “I did receive a benefit—but I repaid it,” or “I did receive a benefit, but I was unable to repay it,” or in the last resort refuge should be found in this: “Not everyone who has failed to repay a benefit is guilty of ingratitude. One has to weigh up the intentions of the person who fails to repay.”</p>
<p>Asinius Pollio used to say we should never attempt as the first question that in which<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_331_1" id="target_note_LCL463_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a> we claim we have received no benefit—unless it is obviously possible to carry the point: if it fails here the case is lost, for it is obvious that someone who doesn’t even acknowledge that he has received a benefit is ungrateful. My<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> friend Gallio thinks that whenever possible we should deprive our opponent of this point,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_331_2" id="target_note_LCL463_331_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and when it is impossible we should weaken it; and whenever even this is impossible, it should be passed over in such a way that we appear to be letting the point go and to be unwilling to make an issue of it even though we could.</p>
<p>The same view was held by a pupil of Apollodorus, Dionysius Atticus. He added this: whenever we cannot make an issue of whether we have received a benefit, we should dispute its <span class="italic">degree</span>, saying that it is not so great a benefit as is alleged—as we do in criminal charges: whenever we cannot deny a charge we concede it, but say it deserves a lighter penalty than the accuser claims.</p>
<p>In the present <span class="italic">controversia</span> Latro with no hesitation<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> made the first question: Did she confer a benefit? This he subdivided: “Even if you knew of your husband’s plan to kill the tyrant and did not inform on him, it is no benefit to refrain from a crime”;
