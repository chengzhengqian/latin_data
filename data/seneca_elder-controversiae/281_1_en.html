dence in court. I am not capable of killing a man; one finds this fault even among pirates. Some cannot live without holding office, others find especial peace in retirement to private life, far from all cause for unpopularity.

do you want to find out if the accuser or the accused is the more guilty? Put the step-mother in a second boat; let her make her vows, say her prayers. If she accused no innocent man, if she did not persecute an undeserving step-son, she will fall into the hands of pirates who know how to let captives go.</p>
