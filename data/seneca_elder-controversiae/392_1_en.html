year of office no-one had been killed. One of the guests said: “I have never seen a man killed.” The woman too said: “Nor I.” Angry that his clemency should be an object for ridicule, he said: “I will make sure they realise I <span class="italic">can</span> be severe.” A criminal was brought in, one who didn’t deserve to see the light of day any longer. “Who was killed? A condemned criminal. Where? In the residence of the praetor. When? Is there any time when a guilty man ought not to die?” Vibius Gallus said:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> “The whore implored me. In fact I was afraid she would request either the death of a man who had never been sentenced or the life of a man who had been sentenced—and win her request.”</p>
<p>On the other side, many good things were said, many in bad taste. In the description of the execution, anyway, faults attended those who wanted to bring in all the ritual words of execution<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_255_1a" id="target_note_LCL464_255_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> to form epigrams. For instance, Triarius said: “‘Remove.’ Do you hear, lictor? Remove the whore from the praetor.” This is not bad. He added: “‘Strike.’ But make sure your rods don’t smash our glasses. ‘Strip.’ Whore, do you recognise the word? Certainly the province does.”</p>
<p>Pompeius Silo, a man celebrated for his judgement,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> also essayed this description, though he did least harm with it, thus: “The whore orders the execution. ‘Act according to the law.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_255_2" id="target_note_LCL464_255_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Is <span class="italic">anything</span> done according to the law <span class="italic">here</span>?”</p>
