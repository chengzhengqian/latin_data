<p><span class="sc">Argentarius.</span> Judges, I am doing something<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> familiar: I am defending my children from a stepmother.—What I ask is that I should not have to lose my daughter because I avenged my son.—If you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_331_1" id="target_note_LCL464_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a> don’t come to my rescue, the step-mother has won, I am defeated.—The woman I married—I don’t know if she is more wicked as wife or step-mother.—The

wrong has she done before? Even the stepmother killed her step-son before her daughter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_331_3" id="target_note_LCL464_331_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—The
