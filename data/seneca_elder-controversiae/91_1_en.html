and different precepts? It is not so. The emotion that was the first to enter our minds is the one that holds sway over us. Luxury, avarice, sloth, envy, fear cannot be unlearned—and every day all these things are either reproved or punished, so tenacious are we even of our vices. Believe me, father, I cannot control myself when the familiar noise of battle has burst out. It thrills me to attack the enemy, to scatter the opposing ranks with the sword. It is this energy, this spirit that has decorated your house with three sets of spoils from the enemy. It is to this you owe those supplications;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_183_1" id="target_note_LCL463_183_1"><sup>1</sup></a> it is because of this that, even as you disinherit me, you love me.—My mind, my tongue are disturbed; I am caught in a task that is foreign to me; the very toga does not sit well on my shoulder.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_183_2" id="target_note_LCL463_183_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Order me to go and besiege<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> the enemy, seize a place for a camp, cut off the enemy supplies: you will see no soldier more spirited.

And up to now (I must tell the truth) the state owes me nothing; I have never fought except under duress.—Do you believe it makes any difference where we are, what course of life we follow? The same dangers encompass us everywhere, and as many routes to death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_183_3" id="target_note_LCL463_183_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—Sometimes we are made stronger by continual hardship; often what labour has hardened sloth has undone.</p>
