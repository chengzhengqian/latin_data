slave?—One girl brings you a son, the other a fortune: which is the richer, father? The one you are trying to win for me is rich; if only you knew how rich <span class="italic">this</span> one would have been!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_145_1" id="target_note_LCL463_145_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—“She is an orphan.” So is the other.
