Timagenes, a man of acid tongue, and over-free with it (because, I imagine, he hadn’t been free himself over a long period).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_471_1" id="target_note_LCL464_471_1"><sup>1</sup></a> From a captive he had become a cook, from a cook a chair-carrier; from being a chair-carrier

But he despised both his present and his past fortunes to such an extent that, when the emperor, angry with him on many counts, barred him from his house, he burned the histories he had written recounting the emperor’s deeds, as though barring him, in his turn, from access to his genius.
