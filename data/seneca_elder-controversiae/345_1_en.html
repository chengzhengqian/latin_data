“This is why I shouted at you: Choose an old man for general.”</p>
<p>Junius Otho senior said he had become a competitor<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> because he had been troubled by certain omens and dreams that foretold this turn of events. Otho was one of the dreamers; wherever he was at a loss for a <span class="italic">colour,</span> he told of a dream.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_161_1" id="target_note_LCL464_161_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>On the fact that he had left the country without the senate’s knowledge, Latro used this <span class="italic">colour:</span> he had not waited for the decree, but had rushed out at once, bewildered and crazed.</p>
<p>Albucius used this <span class="italic">colour:</span> one always makes a quick decision about a general.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_161_2" id="target_note_LCL464_161_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “It was a long business to wait; in short, I hurried—but I came too late.”</p>
<p>Varius Geminus said he had preferred to go alone;<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> for enemies are not moved by the prestige of ambassadors, but they are often influenced by a father’s tears.</p>
<p>Pompeius Silo said: “I thought it more expedient that he should be ransomed with private money: he could be assessed for less than if he were ransomed qua general.”</p>
<p>Argentarius said: “Nothing was so maladroit as for ambassadors to be sent to ransom the general. The enemy would never have given back one whom they judged to be so missed by the state. So I hurried on in advance to ask, and to say: He is despised by the army, abandoned by the state.”</p>
<p>Blandus said: “I was wondering what to do;<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span> should I be content to shed a father’s tears, or should I aid my entreaties with a state retinue? Finally it occurred to me that a Trojan king<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_161_3" id="target_note_LCL464_161_3"><sup>3</sup></a> went to redeem his son alone, without an embassy but with gold.”</p>
