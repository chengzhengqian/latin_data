claimed; but he was not without scholarly ambition—indeed he was the first of all the Romans to recite what he had written before an invited audience.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_425_1" id="target_note_LCL463_425_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Hence the remark of Labienus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_425_2" id="target_note_LCL463_425_2"><sup>2</sup></a> (who had a sharper mind than tongue): “That old man, hero of triumphs,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_425_3" id="target_note_LCL463_425_3"><sup>3</sup></a> never put his declamations in the firing-line
against the people.” Perhaps it was that he lacked confidence in them; or perhaps (as I prefer to suppose) so distinguished an orator regarded this occupation as unworthy of his talents, and, while prepared to get exercise from it, scorned to make a parade of it. However, I heard him both in his prime<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> and afterwards when he was an old man and as it were instructing his grandson, Marcellus Aeserninus. He would listen to him speaking; then first of all he would argue on the side Marcellus had taken, showing him what he had left out, filling out what he had skimmed over, and criticising faulty passages: next he would speak on the other side. He was rather more flowery in declamation than in making speeches: that stern and harsh judgement, that he turned too angrily on his own genius, was so much in abeyance that in many respects he needed allowances made for him that <span class="italic">he</span> hardly granted to others. Marcellus,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> though only a boy, was already so clever that Pollio held him heir-apparent to his own eloquence, though he left in his son, Asinius Gallus, a fine orator; the trouble was that, as always happens, the son was swamped rather than helped by the father’s greatness.</p>
