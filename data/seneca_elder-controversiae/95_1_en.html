<p>On the son’s side, some introduced the <span class="italic">colour</span> of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> making him greedy for fame, and war-like. Nicetes indeed used the phrase: “We shall present him to the judges as full of fury for battle,” and pleaded by complaining that his hands were unemployed and unarmed. Latro disliked this <span class="italic">colour</span>; he preferred the youth to be a soldier as a result of sound judgement and not madness. He said: “Something the father can say effectively is that his son is detracting from tile fame of his own services: he is rash, bloodthirsty, a man whom his father cannot hold back nor the law release.”</p>
<p>Some struck a bargain with the father, like Mento,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> who said he wanted to go on just one more campaign, so as to be seen to have done something for the republic beyond what the law required. Some proclaimed that he would serve for ever: so long as he had the strength, the hero would not fail the republic. Latro did not approve of this <span class="italic">colour.</span> He said the father should not have his hopes for his son destroyed for ever. Vibius Rufus’ speech used the same <span class="italic">colour</span> as Mento s, but he added: “The voices of the envious reach my ears: ‘Did he not fight longer than he needed to?’ Some people even thought that this was an arrangement, a pretence cooked up between the two of us—<span class="italic">I</span> should want to fight, <span class="italic">you</span> would refuse permission.”</p>
<p>Latro pleaded forcefully on the father’s side, adding:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
