to the man you love more than your father.”—One should not obey all one’s father’s orders.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_37_1a" id="target_note_LCL463_37_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> I am doing nothing new in your case: you know I disobeyed my former father, too.—He approached, his beard un-trimmed, his hair dishevelled, his limbs trembling not with age but with hunger, his voice low, thin, stifled by hunger so as to be barely audible, scarcely raising his sunken eyes. I fed him. How, you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_37_2" id="target_note_LCL463_37_2"><sup>2</sup></a> ask. The way I fed <span class="italic">this</span> man.</p>

I want to give a warning to my future father: “This man you wish to adopt supported his father’s enemy against his father’s will. He cheerfully left a rich home to live with a beggar. You should know of this vice of his: he is obstinate in his pity for the distressed.” Yet I have no complaints about my vice: this was what enabled me to find a father—and lose one. How many fathers pray for a son like this! <span class="italic">I</span> get disinherited—twice.—He is a man. Don’t you want me to help a man? He is a citizen. Don’t you want me to help a citizen? He is a friend. Don’t you want me to help a friend: He is a relation. Don’t you want me to help a relation? So we come to a father. He is a man, a citizen, a friend, a relation. On this showing, then, it will only be a vice to give alms if I say: “He is my father.”</p>
