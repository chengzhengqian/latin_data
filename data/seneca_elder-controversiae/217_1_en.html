<h3><span class="sc">The Father who was Dragged from a Graveyard by a Debauchee</span></h3>
<p>A man who had lost three sons was sitting by their grave, when he was carried off by a debauched youth into a nearby garden, given a haircut, and forced to attend a party in different clothes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_435_1" id="target_note_LCL463_435_1"><sup>1</sup></a> When they let him go, he sues for injury.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_435_2" id="target_note_LCL463_435_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="italic">For the father</span>: An order never stifles tears—in fact it provokes them. There is no better cause for tears than to be unable to shed them.—I was in such a state when he hauled me off that I was ashamed to go to a party; I was in such a state when he let me go that I was ashamed to go back to the tomb.—I believe some people are surprised to see me in court when I have just lost my sons; but after all I <span class="italic">have</span> already been to a party.—“How much longer will you weep?” The wretched find a certain pleasure even in their miseries,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_435_3" id="target_note_LCL463_435_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and all adversity discovers a relief
