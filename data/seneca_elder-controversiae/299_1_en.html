passage in which he said that the state couldn’t have been pacified unless that disturber of the public peace had been got rid of. He was the only declaimer who inveighed against Cicero. “Surely, when he judged Antony, together with his whole army, a public enemy, he realised that he had proscribed Popillius too?” This <span class="italic">colour</span> is at first sight rather hard to stomach, but it was excellently handled by Hispo.</p>
<p>Varius Geminus said: “When Antony gave me his orders, I put up with it for fear some client of Publius Clodius’ should be sent to insult him before he killed him, to mutilate him while he still lived.”</p>
<p>Argentarius said: “I came when I was sent for.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> After the proscription Antony had become more formidable even for his own men. I was told to kill Cicero. What was I to do? I could disobey in only one way—by killing myself; and even Cicero could not bring himself to do <span class="italic">that.</span>”</p>

<p>Cestius said: “When Cicero had the message, he said: ‘I always have time for Popillius.’”</p>
<p>Cornelius Hispanus even made Cicero complain: “Popillius, you’re so late.”</p>
<p>Albucius said: “‘What is it, Popillius? Am I not safe in my hiding-place? Must I change my ground?’”</p>
