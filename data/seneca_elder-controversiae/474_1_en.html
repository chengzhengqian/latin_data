<p>Gallio said: “I didn’t think she yet realised her<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> deserts. I wanted her to understand her crime.”</p>
<p>Cestius used this <span class="italic">colour</span>: “She begged defiantly, just as she died, face not cast down, words not meek, as if she had not yet been defeated. I recognised in her nothing of my daughter, nothing of a loser.”—“Why,
first of all, does she not send her brother to me?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_419_1" id="target_note_LCL464_419_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Is she still angry with him?”</p>
<p>Argentarius said: “We asked pardon of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> general, those of us who had had children on the other side. We said: Forgive; we can be stern if we can be secure.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_419_2" id="target_note_LCL464_419_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—“What have I done wrong if my first word to a daughter who came from the enemy camp was not a welcome?”</p>
<p>Clodius Turrinus said: “I wanted her brother to do his sister a good turn. I said to myself: ‘I shall speak rather harshly so that he has to beg me for his sister’s life.’”—“First, why does she beg me alone when she has two to make amends to?”</p>
<p>Gavius Silo said: “I wanted her to be tortured by the delay. Let her (I said to myself) ask twice, a third time: even the gentlest victor does<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_419_3" id="target_note_LCL464_419_3"><sup>3</sup></a> not pardon at once.”</p>
<p>Labienus said: “I was not immediately appeased,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> and, if she had lived, I should not have been swayed by her next prayers, nor even if I had been asked a third or fourth time. ‘But the victor was swiftly won over.’ No wonder: war is easier to forgive than parricide.”</p>
