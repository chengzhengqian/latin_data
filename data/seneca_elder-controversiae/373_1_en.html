<p><span class="sc">Arellius Fuscus Senior.</span> “I cannot do better than Cimon as a husband for my daughter. When shall I have grandsons by him?”—The law gave me the sword in defence of chastity; am I to throw it away?

<p><span class="sc">Cestius Pius.</span> A noble spirit cannot brook insult.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>—You were quite right in wishing to have grandsons by Cimon.—What did you find more praiseworthy in me than my imprisonment?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_217_2" id="target_note_LCL464_217_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—I am not more innocent than my father, not even more unfortunate; the one difference between the fortunes of father and son is that prison was the end of <span class="italic">his</span> troubles, the start of mine.—I will relate to you how I am not ungrateful to any relation of mine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_217_3" id="target_note_LCL464_217_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—Miltiades’ one asset proved to be his son Cimon: and he too had nothing to give in exchange for his father except himself.—I could have hoped for marriage into the house of Cynaegiros or Callimachus, and I had no fear that Cynaegiros would reckon his own hands worth more.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_217_4" id="target_note_LCL464_217_4"><sup>4</sup></a>—The ransom of Cimon is a stroke of good fortune—for the ransomer.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Votienus Montanus.</span> You force me to say: “I<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> have received no service—or I have reciprocated it.”—I shall reciprocate it more surely if you ask for a service from me in as honourable a spirit as you did me
