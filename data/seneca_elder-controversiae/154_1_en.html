<p>On the side of the youth not everybody chose the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> same <span class="italic">colour.</span> Some kept the character they were given for him, harsh and cruel: among them Romanius Hispo, who said there was only one thing to be done—to
make him not harsh but severe. In this passage he spoke the well-known epigram publicised by Fabius Maximus: “The whore constantly comes to the house, she won’t go away, she is virtually my step-mother.”</p>
<p>Cestius found a nice figure for his speech: “Madness is the opposite of sanity. I shall not look elsewhere for an example of a sane man against which to measure my father’s attitude: I shall compare him with himself. He once was sane: what did he do in those days? He used to hate extravagance, castigate vice. Will you think this stern father sane if I show him to you in a brothel?” He declaimed in such a way as to make the father his own accuser, proving him guilty by comparing him with his former self.</p>
<p>Latro spared the father and attacked the boy,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> saying he was not his brother’s son—and that not even his brother had wished to claim he was; what he said was what he was told to say, during his illness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_309_3" id="target_note_LCL463_309_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
