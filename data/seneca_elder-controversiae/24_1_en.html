<p>Blandus had a different <span class="italic">colour.</span> “He appeared suddenly, made ugly by dirt and tears. Fortune, how bitter are your reversals! That once proud and rich man begged food, begged his son, begged the son he had disinherited. Do you ask how long he begged? God forbid he begged for long: but it was longer than you. Do you ask what I did? What I was accustomed to.”</p>
<p>Pompeius Silo had this <span class="italic">colour</span>: “I was moved because<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> he came asking nothing as of right, nothing as in his power—he came as though he were an uncle. <span class="italic">I</span> did not wait for words or for prayers. I embraced and kissed my—father; I gave him food. I did one cruel thing: I said his brother had provided it. It was as if I were reproaching him. not feeding him.”</p>
<p>Triarius’ <span class="italic">colour</span>: “I was afraid that if I didn’t feed him I should be disinherited by my father: I knew how I had pleased <span class="italic">him.</span>”</p>
<p>Argentarius’ <span class="italic">colour</span>: “My father came to me filthy, his wasted limbs trembling, and asked for food. I ask you, judges, what I should do in such a situation. I do not ask <span class="italic">him</span>: he knows how I am likely to behave. Will you tolerate it if I do a wrong to one father and make the other unpopular?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_49_1" id="target_note_LCL463_49_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Though he forbade me to give food (you must believe me) I did not think his ban was sincere. He is trying, I said to myself, to help my glory along, so that it will look as though I fed my father in spite of being forbidden.”</p>
<p>Marullus employed a new <span class="italic">colour</span>: “There fell at<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">19</span><span class="br"></span> ray feet an old man, beard and hair matted. This man, I said to myself, knows somehow that I feel pity.
