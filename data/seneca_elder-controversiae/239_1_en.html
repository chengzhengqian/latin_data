<p>A man trained his two sons as pancratiasts, and presented them to compete at the Olympic games. They were paired off to fight each other. The father went to the combatants and said he would disinherit the one who lost. The youths were both killed together, and had divine honours decreed them. The father is accused of maltreatment by his wife.</p>
