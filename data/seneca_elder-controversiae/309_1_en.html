<p><span class="sc">Cestius Pius.</span> I want to do the same as my<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> mother; she taught me to love my family.—She binds two with the chains of one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_89_1" id="target_note_LCL464_89_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—If I wish to be as loving as my mother’s precedent suggests, I owe even my eyes to my father.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Arellius Fuscus Senior.</span> You will find your deserter son—with his father.</p>

He put in no legal questions, but contrasted the losses suffered by father and mother, and made a sort of general topic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_89_3" id="target_note_LCL464_89_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of the following: Ought a son to go to ransom a captive father or stay to support a blind mother? He divided it thus: What the father needs is disadvantageous to the mother; what the mother needs is advantageous
