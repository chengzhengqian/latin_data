Licinius Nepos was not to be outdone by him; he said: “Slaves and freedmen, cross to the opposite benches,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_145_1" id="target_note_LCL464_145_1"><sup>1</sup></a> you relations he has bought.” And, filching a pretty idea bandied about by everybody: “Sister, I pray for you to be barren,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_145_2" id="target_note_LCL464_145_2"><sup>2</sup></a> he added: “You shouldn’t be surprised that I fear your offspring; I am sure this is the way tyrants are bred.”</p>

<p>A father and son sought a command. The son was chosen in preference to his father. He went to war with the enemy, and was captured. Ten ambassadors were despatched to ransom the general.

He said to them: “Beware treachery.” The father is accused of treachery.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_145_4" id="target_note_LCL464_145_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
