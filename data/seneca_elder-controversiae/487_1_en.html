<p>Damas Scombros said: “Once the danger for the exposed was being thrown out—now it is being reared.”</p>
<p>Cestius translated this idea: “You have made it more dangerous to be reared than to be exposed.”</p>
<p>Arellius Fuscus, rather differently, said: “Up to now the dangers to be feared by luckless infants have been wild beasts, snakes, the freezing cold that threatens tender limbs, and lack of food; we didn’t use to reckon among the perils faced by the exposed the man who reared them.”</p>
<p>Glycon spoke an epigram in bad taste: “Let someone<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> knock at the door of the rich, to get taken in”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_445_1" id="target_note_LCL464_445_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and also: “Now <span class="italic">you</span> can cry, and <span class="italic">you</span> can Avail. A horrid concert!” But our declaimers too have crossed well over into madness. Murredius said: “A long line of wretches is led forth, the greater part dragging themselves along in the absence of their own selves.” And Licinius Nepos: “To be quit, how many times will you have to be reborn to pay the penalty?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_445_2" id="target_note_LCL464_445_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Sparsus said something that Montanus described<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> as damaging to his case as well as in bad taste: “You by yourself have more limbs than you have left to such a crowd.” For the man cannot be thought to have harmed the state unless many have been crippled—but it is clear that not many have if he has more limbs than he left to the cripples. Montanus said that another saying of Sparsus’ was in equally bad taste: “There came forth more beggars than limbs.”</p>
<p>I give Greek epigrams so that you may judge, first, how easily the passage from Greek to Latin eloquence
