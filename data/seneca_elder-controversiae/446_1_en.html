It was he who said to Sparsus, who kept a school together with a certain rhetorician, who was an acute but dry declaimer: “Can <span class="italic">you</span> understand a <span class="italic">controversia</span>—when you don’t understand that you’re washing bricks?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_363_1" id="target_note_LCL464_363_1"><sup>1</sup></a> As for Sparsus, he spoke violently but harshly. He had set himself to imitate Latro—but he never resembled him except when he said the same things. He would use his own words, but Latro’s ideas.</p>
<p>He was a rival of Bassus, whom <span class="italic">you</span> have listened to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> as well as I: an eloquent man, whom one could have wished to have done without the bitterness he affected and without his imitation of an orator’s delivery.

In every clash between them, Latro would have got the glory—but Gallio the prize. Rank the rest as you will: I have given you the chance to judge them all. Let the obscurer ones go their own way—Paternus and Moderatus, Fabius and anyone else who is neither famous nor unknown. But since I have given you my services to the point of sating you, let me produce from up my sleeve some
