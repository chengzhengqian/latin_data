—Pernickety rich man, capable of love even amid shipwrecks!—You hide the crowded<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_205_1" id="target_note_LCL464_205_1"><sup>1</sup></a> wedding ceremony in a remote corner of the countryside; you hold the marriage where only the shipwrecked come.—A tear is always the sign of the undesieed; tears are the guarantee of unwillingness, the face shows the rebelliousness of the mind. No-one ever weeps at what he desires. Tears are the bursting forth of a grief that has been suppressed in the heart, a silence that can be endured no longer. This is how the man who bewails his property amid its ashes shows his hatred of fire; this is how the man who has a shipwreck to lament curses the sea. Weeping is a curse laid, with self-restraint, on the exigencies that afflict men.—Now it is your turn, girl; I am going away,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_205_2" id="target_note_LCL464_205_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and, as once before, I am silent.

My prayers?—I have used <span class="italic">them</span> often; or his tears?—I have moved <span class="italic">them.</span>—All my enemy can accuse me of is marriage.—Great is the love that arises out of pity.—We shed tears<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_205_3" id="target_note_LCL464_205_3"><sup>3</sup></a> out of repentance for our former
