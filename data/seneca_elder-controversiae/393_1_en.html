<p>Hispanus said: “‘Act according to the law.’ It is you that’s being addressed, Flamininus: live without a whore, dine without an executioner.”</p>
<p>Argentarius violently broke up the treatment with his usual fragmented figures. “‘Act according to the law.’ You know the meaning of that? Act by day, act in the forum. The lictor is aghast—he says the same as your whore: he has never seen such a thing.”</p>
<p>Votienus Montanus said: “As he was about to strike, the lictor looked to the praetor—and the praetor to the whore.”</p>
