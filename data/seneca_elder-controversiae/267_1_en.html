Often while he was speaking the trumpet would blow three times,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_5_1" id="target_note_LCL464_5_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for in every <span class="italic">controversia</span> it was his wish to say not what ought to be said but what is capable of being said. He argued laboriously rather than subtly; he used argument to prove argument,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_5_2" id="target_note_LCL464_5_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and as though there were no firm ground anywhere confirmed all his proofs with further proofs.</p>
<p>His argumentation had the further fault that he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> would develop a question not as part of a <span class="italic">controversia</span> but as a <span class="italic">controversia.</span> Every question had its own statement, its treatment, its digressions, its appeals to anger, even its epilogue.

He had no great facility,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_5_3" id="target_note_LCL464_5_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but consummate diction. For he spoke in a swift onrush, yet with premeditation. He wasn’t without the ability to extemporise, according to his more familiar friends, but he thought he was. His epigrams, which Asinius Pollio excellently called “white,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_5_4" id="target_note_LCL464_5_4"><sup>4</sup></a> were simple, open, bringing no hidden or unexpected point with them, merely resonant and brilliant.
