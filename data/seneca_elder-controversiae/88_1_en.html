<h3><span class="sc">Three Times a Hero</span></h3>
<p>Anyone who has acted heroically three times shall be exempt from military service.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_177_1" id="target_note_LCL463_177_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>A father tries to stop a man who has acted heroically three times and wants to go to fight a fourth time. The son refuses; he disinherits him.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">For the father</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Porous Latro.</span> Unhappiest of fathers that I am,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> I should not now be seeing my son were I not disinheriting him.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_177_2" id="target_note_LCL463_177_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—Braver than the law or his father requires, he did not return to me the third time: he was brought back.—What his country has left I claim for his father.—Does my son flee from me—and in the direction of the enemy?—How much longer must I await the news of battles with fear in my heart?
