“Even when I have disinherited him, I shall not let him go out to fight, I shall lay my hands on him, hold him, and at the last let my dead body fall on the threshold as he goes. To get to the enemy you must trample over your father.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_193_1" id="target_note_LCL463_193_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Plancus, a great admirer of Latro, thought that Latro put this idea too strongly, but that Lesbocles the Greek put it too feebly, thus: “I shall lie in your path: pass over your father too—as over a wall or a ditch.”</p>
<p>Arellius Fuscus made the father superstitious, terrified of omens. He said his teacher, when he described in this <span class="italic">controversia</span> the dangers of the battle to come, began with the Homeric verse:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_193_2" id="target_note_LCL463_193_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “Good sir, your strength will consume you.”</p>
<p>Glycon said: “You will see how I despise death. I am this man’s father.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_193_3" id="target_note_LCL463_193_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Diocles of Carystos said: “If you are successful you will merely add one feat of arms. If you fail, you will forfeit three.”</p>
<p>Glycon said: “It is no good omen to be seen off by<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> one who weeps.”</p>
<p>Aeschines—not the orator, for in his day the vogue for declamation did not exist, but the recent declaimer—said,
while warning the son of the danger and saying he was being troubled by omens: “A father is the best of seers with regard to the fate of a son.”</p>
