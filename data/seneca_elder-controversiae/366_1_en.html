I have been shipwrecked, the place where I landed is a worse cause for complaint.—Between wreck and marriage not even a single night intervened.—Put off the wedding until the father-in-law stops crying.—He thinks I have now entrusted him with my daughter—though he doesn’t yet entrust himself to his wife.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_203_1" id="target_note_LCL464_203_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—I come,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_203_2" id="target_note_LCL464_203_2"><sup>2</sup></a> tears flowing as I speak: this is what I was like at my daughter’s wedding too.—If she was raped, why do you refuse to let her have a choice? If she is your wife, what have you to fear?—I take the first chance I have to speak.—I had left my country far out of sight—but I hadn’t yet got past the rich man’s estates. Suddenly the sea bristled with waves, winds blew that battled to destroy us;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_203_3" id="target_note_LCL464_203_3"><sup>3</sup></a> night fell from the sky, and day returned only with the flashes of lightning. We hung in suspense between sky and land. But up to this point, judges, our voyage is prosperous: a worse shipwreck awaits us on the shore.—On the highest ridge of the mountains there was a lofty look-out post<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_203_4" id="target_note_LCL464_203_4"><sup>4</sup></a> owned by the rich man; there he used to reckon up the remains of wrecks, the tribute of misery, the toll exacted for him by the anger of the sea.—He asked about marrying my daughter while the beat of the waves still sounded in my ears; I did what I had to do: prisoner and shipwrecked, I refused my enemy an outrage on her—with my tears.
