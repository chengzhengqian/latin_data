<p>Adaeus the rhetorician: “Weeping mothers contributed, with this thought in their minds: ‘If he is my son, I give in order to feed my son; if he is another’s, so that the others may feed my son too.’”</p>
<p>Some of the Latin declaimers put over this idea,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span> but in such a way that I suppose they were imitating the epigram rather than borrowing it openly. Blandus said: “A woman hands alms to a beggar when she is asked—particularly if she has had a child, and exposed it. How wretched the thought as she hands the money over: ‘Maybe this is my son’!”</p>
<p>Moschus said: “One woman, because she has already thrown alms to more than one child, refuses them to her own.”</p>
<p>Arellius Fuscus said: “A mother is solicited, and gives alms to her son: poor woman, if she knows it to be hers, poor woman, if she does not know.”</p>
<p>Artemon said: “The slaves of others are strong—they sail, they till the ground. Ours are cripples—therefore they support a man who is sound of limb.”</p>
<p>Porcius Latro, who cannot be suspected of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span> plagiarism, for he both despised the Greeks and was ignorant of them, put this epigram more strongly. After describing the crippled limbs of all the children, how some ran up, some crawled, he added: “Good God! Is a whole man fed by <span class="italic">these</span>?”</p>
