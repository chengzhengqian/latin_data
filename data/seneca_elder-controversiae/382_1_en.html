<p>Gargonius in this <span class="italic">controversia</span> showed a disgusting type of bad taste in saying: “This is an adultery against the state, to have sex under the trophies of Miltiades.”</p>
<p>Dorion, having described how prison had been a boast to Cimon, and how he had always shown off about his fortune in that respect, said: “When Callias came in, I uncovered my chains.”</p>
<p>Hybreas said: “Pardon me. . . .”</p>

<h3>How <span class="sc">Flamininus Executed a Criminal at Dinner</span></h3>
<p>An action shall lie for <span class="italic">lèse-majesté.</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_235_1" id="target_note_LCL464_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Flamininus, when proconsul, was once asked a favour by a whore while dining. She said she had never seen a man’s head being cut off. He had a condemned criminal killed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_235_2a" id="target_note_LCL464_235_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> He is accused of <span class="italic">lèse-majesté.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Against Flamininus</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Mento.</span> By now even the men in the death cell<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> were asleep.—The whole routine of execution is gone through, so that the whore could not say she had not seen it all.—I pity anyone who offends the whore! I pity any wife whose beauty the whore envies! The praetor will deny her nothing she asks for.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_235_3" id="target_note_LCL464_235_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

The declamation follows Valerius (as do Cic. <span class="italic">Sen.</span> 42, Val. Max. 2.9.3); Livy, rejecting him, took the opportunity for some declamation of his own (“inter pocula atque epulas, ubi libare diis dapes, ubi bene precari mos esset, ad spectaculum scorti procacis, in sinu consulis recubantis, mactatam humanam victimam esse et cruore mensam respersam!”).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL464_235_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL464_235_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL464_235_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>She might have a rival beauty accused: cf. §2 “An accuser was ready . . .”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL464_235_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
