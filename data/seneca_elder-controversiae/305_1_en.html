different way. He didn’t say: “I wanted to test out my father,” but “in order to make my father pity me.”</p>
<p>Murredius, in accordance with his general stupidity,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> said he had prepared a sleeping-draught, because constant anxieties had made him insomniac. On the side of the father, he gave a <span class="italic">colour,</span> with an epigram worthy of Publilius:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_81_1a" id="target_note_LCL464_81_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> “He mixed in with the poison the times I had disinherited him”; and again: “It was my death he poured on the ground.” I remember that Moschus, speaking of this type of epigram, which had infected all the bright young men even in those days, complained of Publilius for introducing this foolish feature. Cassius Severus, a great lover of Publilius, said it wasn’t his fault, but the fault of those who imitated the side of Publilius that they should have passed by, while failing to imitate things that were better put by Publilius than by any comic or tragic writer, Greek or Roman<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_81_2" id="target_note_LCL464_81_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—for example, one verse which could not (according to Cassius) be matched by any other single line:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">“The greedy lack what they have as much as what</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">they do not have”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_81_3" id="target_note_LCL464_81_3"><sup>3</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and this on the same subject:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line indent1">“Luxury lacks much, avarice everything”;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_81_4" id="target_note_LCL464_81_4"><sup>4</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
