<h3><span class="sc">The Thrice-Disinherited Son Caught Pounding up Poison</span></h3>
<p>A son who had been three times disinherited and three times reprieved was caught by his father pounding up drugs in a secluded part of the house. Asked what it was, he said it was a poison and that he wanted to die. Then he poured it away. He is accused of parricide.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_71_2" id="target_note_LCL464_71_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
