The defendant sits before his day-book and goes over the profits made by the beggars: “<span class="italic">You</span> brought in less today. Get me the whip. I’m glad I didn’t maim the lot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_447_1" id="target_note_LCL464_447_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Why do you weep? Why beg? You’d have brought more home if you had begged like this.” He also spoke this epigram: “Give the wretches the one joy they can feel: let one of them see, another hear this man convicted.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_447_2" id="target_note_LCL464_447_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Glycon said: “This is the one joy left to the wretches.”</p>

<p>Cassius Severus had said: “Show us your prisoners.” Julius Bassus had said: “Show us your paymasters.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_447_4" id="target_note_LCL464_447_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Labienus’ epigram was thought more appropriate: “Show us your nurselings.”</p>
