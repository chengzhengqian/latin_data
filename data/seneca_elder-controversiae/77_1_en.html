“I am safe, so long as my father has no money.”—Whatever you have, send it to ransom your son; there is nothing to be afraid of: you will not go short of food if you say you are father of a tyrannicide.—You put in a word then for an adulterer son, but you put in none now for a tyrannicide: now ask how tyrants are made!</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cestius Pius.</span> Give me my father’s letter. Do<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> you ask where I got it?—for you sent me none. “I will give twice the money.” It’s obvious—he’s begging for his only son. “I will give twice the money.” Half qua son, half qua tyrant slayer. “If you cut his hands off.” This is not permitted even as a punishment for adulterers.—“I didn’t have the money.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_155_1" id="target_note_LCL463_155_1"><sup>1</sup></a> But you can beg them—you can beg them boldly: it is pirates prone to pity I have fallen in with.—Why don’t I support you? Because you—it’s insufficient if I say you did not ransom your son when he was a prisoner. I cannot support you—I have lost my hands. Don’t you believe me? Read your letter. You offered double the money, you offered it to greedy men, you offered it to pirates. This was the excuse the pirates themselves gave when they came to cut off my hands. “Your father ordered it,” they said. “It is a great crime—but the price is high.”—“I am in need,” he says. You lie.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> Give me my father’s income figure. “Well then?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_155_2" id="target_note_LCL463_155_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Will you support your father?” Perhaps if I were loosed, I should promise at your request: I make no bargain.—Are you still after my hands?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_155_3" id="target_note_LCL463_155_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—Say it
