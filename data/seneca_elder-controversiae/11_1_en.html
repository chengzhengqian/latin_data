foundation was obscured by the vast superstructure, and so, though present, was not obvious: indeed, perhaps the greatest fault of acuteness is to flaunt itself unduly. Plots that are hidden are more dangerous; the most useful sort of acuteness is the sort you hide—its effect is plain to see, its presence obscure.</p>
<p>So I shall put in<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_23_1" id="target_note_LCL463_23_1"><sup>1</sup></a> at various places the points at<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> issue in the <span class="italic">controversiae</span> just as he set them out: but I won’t add the arguments that went with them—that would be excessive and irrelevant, for it is the epigrams you want to hear, and any space I deprive them of will annoy you. My friend Latro, of course, was keen on epigrams too. Once we were studying together under the rhetor Marullus, a rather dry man, who said very little prettily, though his style was unusual.
