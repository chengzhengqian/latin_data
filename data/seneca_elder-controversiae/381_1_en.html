criticise him both for translating the epigram and for spoiling it in translation. He doesn’t prefer Thucydides out of any love for him; he is praising someone he does not fear, and thinks he may the more easily overcome Sallust if Thucydides overcomes him first.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_233_1" id="target_note_LCL464_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Cestius had this <span class="italic">colour</span> for Callias. Going on the offensive, he accused Cimon of having allowed his wife to be seduced, of not having guarded her, of having waited till the father should come on the scene to be spectator of his own disaster. “You are ungrateful already<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_233_2" id="target_note_LCL464_233_2"><sup>2</sup></a> even if you let her go. <span class="italic">I</span> did not wait to be asked.”</p>
<p>Romanius Hispo pursued the following <span class="italic">colour:</span> he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> said the youth was boastful and arrogant in the consciousness of his noble birth. He had loathed the favour done him, and was aggrieved that Callias should be called his father-in-law. So he had made every effort not only to allow the girl’s morals to go astray but even to give them a push, so as to have a legitimate excuse for getting rid of her. He had got his opportunity, and he had not wasted it, though he had waited till the father came in. His<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_233_3" id="target_note_LCL464_233_3"><sup>3</sup></a> reflections were: “He is waiting for me; he wants to level accounts with me.” “And he would have levelled them if he had not shown her father his daughter in adultery.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_233_4" id="target_note_LCL464_233_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

Otherwise Callias’ service (so much resented by Cimon) and Cimon’s killing of the daughter would have exactly balanced. Now Callias is “one up.” This sentence is perhaps a quotation from Hispo’s declamation or a comment of Seneca’s; probably not part of Callias’ reflections.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL464_233_4').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
