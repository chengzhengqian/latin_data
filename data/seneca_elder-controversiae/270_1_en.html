shuns everything that resembles vulgarity, let alone vulgarity itself.</p>
<p>Albucius was rarely lucky—but always well thought of. However sorry one was to have been to hear him, one was glad to go again. He was a gloomy, anxious declaimer, one who worried about his performance even at the end of a speech—in fact no moment was free of care for him. And it was this anxiety that drove him away from the forum—and in particular the cruel outcome of one single figure.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_11_1" id="target_note_LCL464_11_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Once, at a trial in the centumviral court,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_11_2" id="target_note_LCL464_11_2"><sup>2</sup></a> because he was told that the terms of an oath had on one occasion been prescribed by his adversary, he brought in a figure involving an oath which enabled him to make all the charges recoil on him. “You want,” he asked, “to settle the point<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> by means of an oath? Swear—but I will dictate the oath. Swear by the unburied ashes of your father. Swear by your father’s memory.” And he finished the topic. When he had finished, Lucius Arruntius got up on the other side, and said: “We accept the terms, he will swear.” Albucius screamed: “I wasn’t putting forward terms—I was using a figure.” Arruntius insisted. The centumviri were at the end of their business, and in a hurry. Albucius cried: “At this rate figures are banished from the world.” Arruntius said: “Let them go: we shall be able to survive without them.” The outcome of the matter was this: the centumviri said they would decide for Albucius’ opponent if he would swear; he did swear.
