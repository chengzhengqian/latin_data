the slave too—you made him wicked when he had been good.”</p>
<p>Albucius employed this <span class="italic">colour</span>: the girl was still not grown up, not yet ripe for violation. “We did not take her away with us just because thanks to her age she could not feel the effects of the tyranny.”</p>
<p>Cestius said: “I definitely do not propose to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> deprive the slave of the credit that is his due. He had good intentions; he hoped it could turn out that, if he kept her a virgin, he might be manumitted when she got married.”</p>
<p>Varius Geminus said: “Perhaps he had a mistress and didn’t like this woman. Some people avoid sleeping with a virgin. Perhaps he knew that she would not put up with it, and feared bad fortune to come—something that at times makes even bad slaves good.” And he added this epigram, which was widely publicised: “Would a jail-bird dare to sleep with his mistress unless the father<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_137_1" id="target_note_LCL464_137_1"><sup>1</sup></a> had permitted it?” And he also said: “Is it to this that you returned from exile, father? Why then did we go into exile?”</p>
<p>Buteo wanted it to appear that the father really<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> had gone out of his mind, and in his narration he said: “How sad he was when he came home after hearing the tyrant’s edict! How he wept in his daughter’s bosom! I think that was when his mind became unhinged.”</p>
<p>Varius Geminus on the slave’s continence: “He didn’t dare to violate his mistress and drag her into his cell. Unless you prefer an account like this: Even then he was beginning to entertain hopes of marrying my sister.”</p>
