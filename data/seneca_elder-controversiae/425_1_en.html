<p>Albucius’ <span class="italic">colour</span> was to say that he hadn’t wanted<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span> the child to be brought up in so ill-omened a house, one from which his two brothers had already been carried out to burial; among the reasons for the death of the second was the fate of his brother. And he kept to this <span class="italic">colour,</span> in such a way as to attack neither the step-mother nor the father; he said the grandfather would be on very firm ground if he was content merely to defend himself. “‘Well then, why did you take him?’ I loved him; it was on this boy that I had particularly set my heart from the beginning. In your house I feared nothing except the house itself. If two children had died in <span class="italic">my</span> house, I should have moved the third elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Votienus Montanus said that Marcius Marcellus’<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> narrative went like this: “The boy followed me. I’m not trying to incriminate him in your eyes. Whatever happens, may the peril be mine rather than his—it was I who took him. ‘Where is he?’ says his father. He is alive and well; come and look at him whenever you wish.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_321_1" id="target_note_LCL464_321_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ‘Give him back.’ <span class="italic">I</span> am not a cruel man: come, I will show you if you like who it was<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_321_2" id="target_note_LCL464_321_2"><sup>2</sup></a> who removed your sons, before me.”</p>
<p>Varius Geminus had the same idea: “What is this affection, so late in the day, so perverse? You look for your children, starting only with the third.”</p>
<p>Votienus Montanus, a man of rare though not faultless<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
talent, could not avoid in school either the fault that waylays him in his speeches; but in his speeches, the material being more diffuse, one notices repetition
