their life were preserved. “Let people stir up ill-feeling, say that one lacks eyes, another hands, say that it is thanks to this man that they live such a wretched life—so long as they acknowledge that they owe life itself to him.” Gallio also tried this argument out among his others: “Far from harming the state, this practice may be thought even to have been of advantage to it; there will be fewer prepared to expose their sons.”</p>
<p>Clodius Turrinus used this <span class="italic">colour</span>: “Many fathers<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> are in the habit of exposing offspring who are no good.
