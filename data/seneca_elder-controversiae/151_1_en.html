No-one is faultless: Cato lacked moderation, Cicero firmness, Sulla clemency.—To sum up, there were three of us—and we all acted wrongly: I in disinheriting, your brother in saying nothing,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_303_1" id="target_note_LCL463_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a> you in not begging for your brother.—I am not satisfied with one heir, I want to have two: and—to make my desire greater—I did once have two.—He has sent to me, ill and sick. Shall I not go?

<p><span class="sc">Arellius Fuscus Senior.</span> Anyone who thinks I am influenced by money is mistaken. First of all, I have got used to having an heir joint with me. Then, I have long since divided my father’s estate with this child, because my father has given him much more than his share.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_303_5" id="target_note_LCL463_303_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
