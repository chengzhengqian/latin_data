point: even if she had done a service, there was no need to repay her in this way; further, a service is something done as an act of judgement, not as a result of madness or disease.</p>
<p>Romanius Hispo used a different <span class="italic">colour,</span> saying that the girl had followed him not because she loved the youth but because she hated her father. He wanted to deprive her of the credit even for love.</p>
<p>Buteo used a far-fetched <span class="italic">colour</span>: he wanted it to seem that everything had happened not against the will of the father,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_147_1" id="target_note_LCL463_147_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but at his secret instigation, though on the surface he pretended not to. By this artifice an honourable match had been made that would have been impossible otherwise. They could not have escaped if the father had not allowed it. But Latro said that to deprive her of the credit for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> freeing the youth was too great a price to pay for her losing the unpopularity resulting from her abandoning her father.</p>
<p>Arellius Fuscus declaimed excellently: his orders were that the girl should be divorced, but not because of the marriage to the orphan—she should be got rid of even if the orphan didn’t exist. It wasn’t that he liked another girl more; he didn’t like this one. He pressed a point skated over by Latro, that he was afraid of this impulsive girl, born and bred amidst pirates, who felt no sense of duty towards her own father.</p>
<p>Gallio said something that all the schoolmen left out, that he was afraid she might be a spy ready to let the pirates know of any opportunity for plunder—or she might be thought to be: and he didn’t propose to be suspect in the eyes of the state.</p>
