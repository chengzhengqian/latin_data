He complains of the peril to one he almost lost—this man who preaches cautious love.—Where love is concerned, a parting is easier to come by than restraint. Will you get lovers to observe limits as though they have to answer for them, do nothing without forethought, promise nothing except as though by legal covenant, weigh up all their words rationally and conscientiously? That is the way old people love.—Father,
you know of few of our crimes. We have, at times, quarrelled, been reconciled, and—though you may not think it—perjured ourselves. What is it to do with a father if lovers swear? If you will believe it, it is nothing to do even with the gods.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_263_1" id="target_note_LCL463_263_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—There is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> no need, wife, for you to pride yourself on being the first to sin<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_263_2" id="target_note_LCL463_263_2"><sup>2</sup></a> thus. Women have perished with their husbands, women have perished for them: <span class="italic">they</span> will be honoured by every age, sung by every genius. Contrive, father, to endure your good fortune.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_263_3a" id="target_note_LCL463_263_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> What a small price <span class="italic">you</span> have to pay for so glorious an instance!—For the future, as you instruct us, we have become more cautious. We acknowledge our mistake. We forgot, when we swore, that there was a third party—who loved more; may it always be so, ye gods.—Do you persist, father-in-law? Take your daughter back; <span class="italic">I</span> was the sinner, and <span class="italic">I</span> deserve punishment. Why should I be the cause of censure to my wife, of childlessness to her father? I shall leave the city, flee, go into exile, endure my loss as best I may with a miserable and heartless endurance. I should kill myself—if I could die alone.”</p>
