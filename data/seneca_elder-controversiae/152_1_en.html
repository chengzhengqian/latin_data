<p><span class="sc">Romanius Hispo.</span> He chanced upon a whore who, amidst all her other disadvantages, was also fertile.—Truly
this was like a stage-marriage, where the lover came into the bedroom before the husband.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_305_1" id="target_note_LCL463_305_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="sc">Argentarius.</span> As he disinherited, he said: “Am I supposed to wait until you raise children by a whore?”—Woman, I’m not sure whether you do my father more injury by depriving him of an heir or providing him with one.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Albucius Silus.</span> Let the friends and relatives<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> come there:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_305_2" id="target_note_LCL463_305_2"><sup>2</sup></a> they refuse, they blush to approach the house of a prostitute.—Woman—I cannot decently name you without asking my hearers’ pardon first-give me this boy who can be acknowledged by no-one if his mother claims him.—My scrupulous father disinherited even one whom he knew to be his own son.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_305_3" id="target_note_LCL463_305_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—There was a boy in the house,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_305_4" id="target_note_LCL463_305_4"><sup>4</sup></a> who used to call everybody father.—He adopted the son of a woman who had caused him to throw out even his own.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cestius Pius.</span> There is no type of judge I refuse. If the judges are harsh, it will go against him that he took in the son of a whore. If they are clement, that he disinherited his own.—My father cried: “Shall a whore then come to my house—or, what is more shameful, shall my son go to her?”—He has sent into our house a child who belongs to everyone.—Who took part in a wedding like that except a disinherited son—or one who deserved to be?</p>
<p>Latro’s division was: Can a father be accused on<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> account of any adoption? Should he be for this one?</p>
