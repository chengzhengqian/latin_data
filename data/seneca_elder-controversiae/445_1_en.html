man saying of siphons: “They rain back at the sky,” and about sprays:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_361_1" id="target_note_LCL464_361_1"><sup>1</sup></a> “perfumed showers,” or using the phrase “chiselled forests” of a spruce garden, and “springing glades” of a picture? Or what I remember him saying of sudden deaths one day when you took me along to listen to him: “Every bird that flies, every fish that swims, every beast that roams finds burial in our stomachs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_361_2" id="target_note_LCL464_361_2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="italic">Now</span> ask why we die suddenly: it is on deaths that we live.” Should he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> not have paid us for that with his hide, even if he <span class="italic">had</span> already been manumitted?

<p>Moschus spoke not badly, but he was his own worst enemy: he burned to say everything by means of a figure, with the result that his oratory was not figured but warped.
