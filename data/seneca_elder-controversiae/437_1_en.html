<p>Triarius said: “‘What? Did a mother lie?’ Get rid of the word mother; once she was condemned, she became a step-mother.”</p>
<p>Blandus said: “I shall name the girl who stood by her father, who wept when her brother died, who did not weep when her mother was tortured.”</p>
<p>Pompeius Silo said: “She said: My daughter is my accomplice. After this I noticed the same look on her face as I had seen when her step-son was dying.”</p>
<p>Votienus Montanus said that his friend Marcius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> Marcellus, whom he often mentions in his writings as an eloquent man, spoke this epigram: “She found a way to accuse though convicted, to kill while dying, to torture while under torture. This is no laying of information—it is a second poisoning by the stepmother.”</p>
<p>Latro, describing the tortures, had said: “Standing over her, I urged on the work not as accuser but as torturer. <span class="italic">I</span> stoked the fire, <span class="italic">my</span> hands stretched the rack. Shall I not drink her blood, tear out her eyes? She took my son from me; if I hadn’t crushed her first, she would have taken away my daughter too.”</p>
<p>Triarius said: “When I was accusing her, I charged her with poisoning. In the last part of my speech, amidst my entreaties, I exhorted the girl to avenge her brother. That is what particularly influenced the judges—and particularly angered the step-mother.”</p>
<p>Albucius said: “After she named her daughter, she looked at me, I suppose to find out whether she had tortured me enough.”</p>
<p>At this same spot, Nicetes made an excellent remark: “She says: My accomplice is the daughter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_345_1" id="target_note_LCL464_345_1"><sup>1</sup></a> And she added: of this man.”</p>
