<p>An action may lie for injury.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_369_2a" id="target_note_LCL464_369_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>A man who had a son and a rich enemy was found killed, though not robbed. The youth, dressed in mourning, began to follow the rich man about. The rich man took him to court, and demanded that if he had any suspicions he should accuse him. The poor man said: “I shall accuse when I can,” and continued to follow the rich man in mourning clothes just the same. The rich man stood for office, but was rejected; he accuses the poor man of injury.</p>
