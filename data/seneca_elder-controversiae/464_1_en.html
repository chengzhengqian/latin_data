for some time, he said: “If I beg to no avail, what do you think I shall do? Go to the temples or the gods as suppliant? No, I shall flee for refuge to your statues.”</p>
<p>Pompeius Silo tried in this <span class="italic">controversia</span> too the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> question which he thought should be tried in all cases involving the disinheriting of heroes: Can a hero be disinherited? He said that this could be handled nowhere better than in this case. “You cannot disinherit him, for he can defeat you. Are you surprised if by this law the father loses his power over a son who is compared to him—and found superior?”</p>

At that trial your good fortune was regarded by all as enviable, for the point at dispute was whether you had been luckier in fighting or in begetting. Don’t imagine they thought me the braver. They were misled, father: they decided not according to the facts, but according to what they believed you preferred.”</p>
