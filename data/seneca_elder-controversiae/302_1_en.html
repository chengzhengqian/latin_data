of parricide, he lives—though he wanted to die when he was disinherited.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_75_1" id="target_note_LCL464_75_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—To how small a compass is the fortune of my house reduced! Either father or son must die.—Why should you want to die? The bereaved live, the shipwrecked live, even those who are afflicted with thrice-disinherited sons live.—Though
he says he wants to die, here he is begging for life.—I have here a clear case of parricide: he is quite ready to cause his own death as well.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cornelius Hispanus.</span> Don’t be surprised if I don’t show the vehemence that suits my griefs; you have found out from three judgements that fathers are incapable of accusing.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Vibius Rufus.</span> Since what you confess is so great,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> what is the enormity of the crime you deny?—You looked for poison, bought it, brought it into the house where your father was your enemy.—You would have been right to hate life if even then<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_75_2" id="target_note_LCL464_75_2"><sup>2</sup></a> I had charged you with parricide.—You wish to know what your fault was? Tell us who sold it you. We will say to him: Did you sell poison? Did you sell it to a son who had three times been disinherited? Doubtless you didn’t know whom he intended it for.—Then by this trial I am delaying my son’s death?—If you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_75_3" id="target_note_LCL464_75_3"><sup>3</sup></a> make me live in the same house as him, I shall die—and
make you as odious as he wanted to make me.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_75_4" id="target_note_LCL464_75_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="sc">Varius Geminus.</span> Are you trying to find out whom my son prepared the poison for? <span class="italic">He</span> didn’t drink it.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pompeius Silo.</span> “I prepared it for myself.” That is equivalent to preparing it for your father.—Acquitted
he wants to die, accused he lives.</p>
