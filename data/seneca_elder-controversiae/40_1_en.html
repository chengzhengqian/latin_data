gods wanted to show their power by means of this girl, to make it clear that no human strength could stand up to the majesty of the gods. They thought it would count as a miracle if freedom were seen in a captive, chastity in a prostitute, innocence in one accused.</p>
<p>Latro said: “There have been luckier captives—none braver.”</p>
<p>Marullus described how great the girl’s dignity was: her very face showed something lofty and proud. Then he added an epigram which Latro used to admire, even, as he himself put it, to “dote on”: “You may say that all came to her as to a prostitute—so long as you say that they went away as from a priestess.”</p>
<p>Albucius said: “There came a man of fierce and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> violent temperament, sent, I believe, by the gods themselves to put on display the chastity of one destined to be priestess, not to violate it. She told him to keep his hands off her holy body: ‘You must not dare to harm chastity that men preserve and gods look forward to.’ When he came rushing to his doom, she said: ‘Look, your weapon—you do not realise that it is in the cause of chastity that you carry it.’ And seizing the sword she drove it into her attacker’s breast. Those same immortal gods took care that this deed of hers should not go unnoticed; an accuser turned up to bear witness to her chastity in the courts. No-one could believe a man had been killed by a woman, a youth by a girl, one armed by one unarmed. It was too great a feat for it to be supposed to have taken place without the aid of the immortal gods.”</p>
