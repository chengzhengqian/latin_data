others you <span class="italic">don’t</span> know—ones who lacked the background<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_365_1" id="target_note_LCL464_365_1"><sup>1</sup></a> rather than the talent to arrive at fame.</p>
<p>Gavius Silo was a good declaimer. He was paid a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> fine tribute by the emperor Augustus, who had heard him pleading a good many times in the colony of Tarraco. He said: “I’ve never heard a more eloquent family man.” Silo was the sort of person to put forward the father of the family and keep the orator in the background; he thought it part of eloquence to hide one’s eloquence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_365_2" id="target_note_LCL464_365_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Clodius Turrinus, too, used to put a lot into his declamation; his son you regard with a brotherly affection—a youth who would master the highest eloquence if he did not prefer to practise what he has rather than to acquire what he is capable of. But the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span> elder Turrinus had removed a good deal of his own force by following Apollodorus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_365_3" id="target_note_LCL464_365_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and regarding his sect as the supreme rule of oratory: but he had enough strength left over to be effective even in the absence of art. His epigrams were vigorous, wily and pointed. He always used to discuss the topic of the <span class="italic">colour</span> with Latro. Latro never used to debate at supper or at any other time when he could not declaim. He used to say some <span class="italic">colours</span> are at first sight hard and harsh—they can only win acceptance in the course of a speech. He said he could only please as a whole; he knew his own strength, and relying on it ventured on things that were perilous and frightening to others. In many matters he did not persuade the judge, but imposed on him.
