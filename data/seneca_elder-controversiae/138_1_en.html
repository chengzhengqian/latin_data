come into the open, old man: it is because of your pity that I am called cruel: didn’t you think you should discuss the matter with me? How do you know what sort of a son I have? <span class="italic">I</span> certainly don’t know yet what sort of a daughter <span class="italic">you</span> have.—“Time is getting short now.” Yet you still have leisure to accuse me? No time is too short for a single word.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_277_1" id="target_note_LCL463_277_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="sc">Vibius Rufus.</span> Who in the world has ever been<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> <span class="italic">told</span> to forgive, apart from me?—“Time is short now.” Do you think me incapable of working out how much there is left? “Time is short now.” It would be short if you had two to win over. “Time is short,” he cries. “I don’t know when I can ask him.” Well, you should have asked me first, then. I don’t say that because I deserve to be asked first, because I am your father, but—a very small point—because
I live nearer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_277_2" id="target_note_LCL463_277_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—Surely this is the point of the clause in the law that says:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_277_3" id="target_note_LCL463_277_3"><sup>3</sup></a> “let him win over both his own father . . .”</p>
<p><span class="sc">Publius Asprenas.</span> Is this how to win favour? How to beg pardon? This is obviously the first time you have had to beg.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_277_4" id="target_note_LCL463_277_4"><sup>4</sup></a>—I am mad: in fact, if you wish, I will give you a proof: my son is about to die, and I haven’t yet changed my will.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cornelius Hispanus.</span> Many emotions divide me. I must complain of some, blush for others, fear others, deliberate, even now, on all.—Not even <span class="italic">he,</span> however complaisant he may be called, would have granted his forgiveness if he had been begged like <span class="italic">this.</span></p>
