Happiness is vulnerable and perishable, and all good fortune’s nattering glitter has danger mingled with its lures; often it has cosseted men for no reason, often deserted them without a cause. I have seen the leader of a great army in flight and companionless; I have seen the threshold deserted by its mob of hopeful clients, and put up for sale, its owner the auctioneer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_205_3" id="target_note_LCL463_205_3"><sup>3</sup></a> No need to tell of those who have toppled from supreme wealth to poverty.
