<h3>How <span class="sc">Cimon was Ungrateful to Callias</span></h3>
<p>Whoever catches an adulterer with his mistress in the act, provided that he kills both, may go free.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_215_1" id="target_note_LCL464_215_1"><sup>1</sup></a> An action may lie for ingratitude.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_215_2" id="target_note_LCL464_215_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Miltiades, convicted of embezzlement, was imprisoned and died. His son Cimon gave himself as substitute for his father’s body so that it could be buried. Callias, a rich man of low birth, ransomed him from the state and paid the money; he married his daughter to him. Cimon caught her in adultery, and killed her despite her father’s pleas. He is accused of ingratitude.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_215_3a" id="target_note_LCL464_215_3a"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

Nearest to him are Ephorus (see Jacoby 70 <span class="italic">FGH</span> 64) and Diodorus (10.30.1; 10.32), who give Cimon’s marriage to an unnamed rich wife as the reason for his being able to pay.
