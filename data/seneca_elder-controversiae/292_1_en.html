eloquence! Popillius is charged with misconduct.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_55_1" id="target_note_LCL464_55_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—He
cut Cicero’s neck while he was still speaking; this is the greetings an acquitted client gives after a long interval.—Stop there, please, Popillius; Antony merely told you to kill Cicero.—He has done two parricides: you have heard tell of one, seen the other.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Cestius Pius.</span> If I say: “Your adolescence is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> shameful, your boyhood a disgrace,” he will reply: “Cicero has already defended that.”—Do you feel no shame, Popillius? It is your <span class="italic">accuser</span> who still lives.—“What is so commonly shared as breath by the living, earth by the dead, sea by the storm-tossed, shore by those cast up?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL464_55_2a" id="target_note_LCL464_55_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> Parricide, you too would have died like that.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Fulvius Sparsus.</span> Antony would not have believed Popillius would do it if he hadn’t recalled that he had also done a parricide.—What an outrage! I have to defend Cicero—yet Cicero defended Popillius.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mento.</span> No-one but Popillius could have killed Cicero—just as no-one but Cicero could have defended Popillius.—The man who the living Cicero said was no parricide was shown to be one by Cicero dead.—What
luck Cicero had! Antony, who had proscribed him, he had accused; Popillius, who killed him, he had defended.—If you had been convicted, the executioner would have sewn you in the sack unmutilated.—I see what he may reply: “Antony will not believe that Popillius killed Cicero unless he takes him back a proof.”</p>
