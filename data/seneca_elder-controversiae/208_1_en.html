pledges of hospitality?—“We’re trapped,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_417_1" id="target_note_LCL463_417_1"><sup>1</sup></a> son,” I said. “Let us get out while we can, but together, as though we were escaping from Philip.”—At least we were <span class="italic">men</span> when Philip was our enemy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_417_2" id="target_note_LCL463_417_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—My tears are brought up against me—as though I have ever stopped crying since Olynthus fell.—Apparently<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL463_417_3" id="target_note_LCL463_417_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I am so important that I had the power to arouse the people in a city where I hadn’t the power to save my son.—It is not a gathering and assembly whenever a number of people have come together to a certain place, but only when they have been called together, when they have assembled, as if ready to follow their leader: not if one district has gathered, or a few passers-by have drifted up, but where a whole people or a good part of it, a state divided into factions, has assembled. An assembly is the name for a large crowd gathering in pursuance of some common plan. But on that occasion there were few people at first; the rest came later not because I summoned them, but because of the fire. And the populace preferred gaping at that to putting it out.—The law doesn’t punish the man who was the occasion of an assembly, but the man who was the instigator of it.—Revenge wasn’t worth the loss of my son; I tried to beg the people off, but I failed.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The other side</span>: What need is there of a crowd? There are laws prescribed to avenge any injury.—Once
a crowd is aroused it cannot control itself.—Thanks
to that fire the city might have gone up in flames.</p>
