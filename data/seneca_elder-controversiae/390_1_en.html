Roman people. ‘But they judge other Romans from you.’ No: for there have been others, before this man, from whom assessment may be made; and after him there will be still more. And no-one ascribes to cities the faults of individuals. ‘But the act itself is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span> disgraceful.’ Yes, but so are many others, without necessarily impairing the majesty of the state.

Some things that are permissible become impermissible if time and place alter.”</p>
<p>What <span class="italic">colour</span> should be used in defence of Flamininus?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span> Some <span class="italic">controversiae</span>—and this is one—allow defence of an act but not excuse for it. We cannot stop the accused from being censured because of this;
