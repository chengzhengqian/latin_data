<p class="noindent">At the same time, too, Hadrian, it is reported, remarked with a laugh: “I seem to have adopted, not a son, but a god”.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_91_1" id="target_note_LCL139_91_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Yet when one of these same literary men who was present tried to console him, saying: “What if a mistake has been made in casting the horoscope of this man who, as we believe, is destined to live”? Hadrian is said to have answered: “It is easy for you to say that, when you are looking for an heir to your property, not to the Empire”. This makes it clear that he intended to choose another heir, and at the end of his life to remove Verus from the government of the state. However, fortune aided his purpose. For after Verus had returned from his province, and had finished composing, either by his own efforts or with the help of imperial secretaries or the rhetoricians, a very pretty speech, still read nowadays, wherein he intended to convey his thanks to his father Hadrian on the Kalends of January, he<span class="marginNote right">1 Jan., 138.</span>
swallowed a potion which he believed would benefit him and died on that very day of January.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_91_2" id="target_note_LCL139_91_2"><sup>2</sup></a> All public lamentation for him was forbidden by Hadrian because it was the time for assuming the vows for the state.</p>

In the palace his stay was but a short one; in his private life, though there was little to be commended, yet there was little to be blamed.</p>
