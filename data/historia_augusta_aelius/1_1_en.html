<p>To Diocletian Augustus, his devoted servant, Aelius Spartianus, greeting:</p>
<section class="div2">
<p>I. It is my purpose, Diocletian Augustus, greatest of a long line of rulers, to present to the knowledge of your Divine Majesty, not only those who have held as ruling emperors the high post which you maintain—I have done this as far as the Deified Hadrian—but also those who either have borne the name of Caesar, though never hailed emperors or Augusti, or have attained in some other fashion to the fame of the imperial power or the hope of gaining it. Among these I must tell first and foremost of Aelius Verus, who through his adoption by Hadrian became a member of the imperial family, and was the first to receive only the name of Caesar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_83_1a" id="target_note_LCL139_83_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Since I can tell but little of him, and the prologue should not be more extensive than the play, I shall now proceed to tell of the man himself.</p>
