drew me into it. I’m promising my wife’s services to others
as if she were to go and lick the plates. What a disgraceful
creature he is! He told me his wife would send
for her. But she says she doesn’t need her. (<span class="italic">pauses</span>) It
would be odd if this neighbor of mine hasn’t got wind of
this already. But on the other hand I get the impression<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">555</span><span class="br"></span>
that if it were like that, she’d be having an argument with
me. I’ll go inside to haul the ship back onto her berth
again.</p></div>
