games are on, and we have played a game with the bankers.
It’s calm, it’s the halcyon days<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL061_17_1" id="target_note_LCL061_17_1"><sup>1</sup></a> throughout the forum.
They’re being reasonable: during the games they don’t
demand anything from anyone, but after the games they
don’t return anything to anyone. If your ears are empty,
pay attention: I want to give you the name of the comedy.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>
This comedy is called <span class="italic">Kleroumenoi</span> in Greek, in Latin
“Men Casting Lots.” Diphilus wrote it in Greek, and after

old man lives here. He has a son, and that son lives together
with his father in that house. He has a certain

this old man fell madly in love with her, and, in
opposition to him, his son did so too. Now each of them,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">50</span><span class="br"></span>
father and son, is preparing his legions against the other
