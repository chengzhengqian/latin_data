wretched as me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">par</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) I’m fooling him wittily: what I told him has happened
was a lie from first to last. My mistress and this

been sent to fool him.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">Hey there, Pardalisca!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">par</span><p class="lineGroup">What is it?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">hesitating</span>) There is . . .</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">par</span><p class="lineGroup">What?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">There is something I want to ask you.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">And you are saddening me. But does Casina still have a
sword?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">par</span><p class="lineGroup">She does; two, actually.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">What, two?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">par</span><p class="lineGroup">She says she’s going to kill you with one and the overseer
with the other today.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m the most killed man of all who live. I think it’s best for<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">695</span><span class="br"></span>
me to put on a breastplate. What about my wife? Hasn’t
she approached her and taken them away?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">par</span><p class="lineGroup">No one dares come near her.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">Let her persuade her.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">par</span><p class="lineGroup">She’s asking her. She says she’ll only put them down if she
knows she won’t be given to the overseer.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">angrily</span>) But since she won’t marry willingly, she’ll marry<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">700</span><span class="br"></span>
against her will today. Why shouldn’t I see through what
I’ve begun, that she should marry me? I meant, “our
overseer.”</p></div>
