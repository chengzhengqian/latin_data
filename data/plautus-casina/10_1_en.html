<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">I do believe you; I’m quite right not to be fonder of any
neighbor than of you, and there is none who has more
qualities in her that I’d wish for for myself.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">myr</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m fond of you and I’m keen to know what is the matter.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">He despises me terribly at home.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">185</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">myr</span><p class="lineGroup">Oh, what’s that? Say it again, please—I haven’t fully got
your complaints in my head.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">My husband holds me in terrible contempt, and I have no<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">190</span><span class="br"></span>
opportunity to obtain my right.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">myr</span><p class="lineGroup">That’s strange, if you’re telling the truth: it’s husbands
who can’t obtain their right from their wives.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">No, he demands to give my slave girl, who is mine, who
was brought up at my expense, to his overseer, against my
will; but he himself is in love with her.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">myr</span><p class="lineGroup">Please, be quiet.</p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">196</span><span class="br"></span></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">But surely now I can speak here: we’re alone.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">myr</span><p class="lineGroup">That’s true. Where do you have her from? A decent
woman ought not to have any property of her own behind<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">200</span><span class="br"></span>
her husband’s back, but a woman who does hasn’t acquired
it in an acceptable way, but is stealing it from her
husband or got hold of it through sexual liaisons. I believe
that everything that’s yours is your husband’s.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">You’re speaking against your friend with every word you
utter.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">myr</span><p class="lineGroup">Do be quiet, silly, and listen to me. Just don’t oppose him,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">205</span><span class="br"></span>
let him love, let him do what he likes, since you don’t lack
anything at home.</p></div>
