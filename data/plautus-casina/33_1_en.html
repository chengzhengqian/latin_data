your wonderful friend, somehow got annoyed with his
wife. When I invited her, he said he couldn’t send her.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">This is your greatest shortcoming: you aren’t charming
enough.</p></div>

to charm other men. You go and fetch her yourself.
I want to prepare indoors whatever’s needful, my dear
husband.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">Then hurry up.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes. (<span class="italic">aside</span>) Now I’ll inject some fear into his heart. I’ll<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">590</span><span class="br"></span>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">And I to you. What do you say, you good-for-nothing?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">595</span><span class="br"></span>
What did I entrust you with? What did I ask you for?</p></div>
