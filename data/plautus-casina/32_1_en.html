<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">turning round</span>) Now I’ve made fun of him in a lovely
way. How the old wretches are running around! I wish
that useless, decrepit husband of mine would turn up
now, so that I could make fun of him in turn, after I’ve<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">560</span><span class="br"></span>
had my fun with this other one: I’m keen to create some
argument between the two. (<span class="italic">looking around</span>) But look,
here he comes. When you see him look so solemn,
though, you’d think that he’s a decent human being.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">It’s great stupidity, in my opinion at least, for any lover<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">565</span><span class="br"></span>
who has something to love available for that day, to go to
the forum. That’s what I did, idiot that I am. I wasted the
day while I was standing there as an advocate for a certain
relation of mine. I’m happy he lost the case, so that he
didn’t ask me to be his advocate without any effect today:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">570</span><span class="br"></span>
in my opinion a man who calls advocates ought to ask first
and find out if the man he’s calling has a mind to help him
or not. If he says no, he should send him home mindless.
(<span class="italic">pauses</span>) But look, my wife’s in front of the house. Poor
me! I’m afraid that she isn’t deaf and has heard all this.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">575</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
