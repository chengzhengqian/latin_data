<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">Hey there, my wife, it’s enough now. Control yourself.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">250</span><span class="br"></span>
You’re making too much noise. Save some speech for
something to argue about with me tomorrow. But what
do you say? Have you tamed your passion now, so as to do
what your husband wants done rather than oppose him?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">What about?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">You ask? About the slave girl Casina, so that she can be
given in marriage to our overseer, a useful slave and one
where she’ll be well supplied with wood, hot water, food,
and clothes, and where she can properly raise the children
she bears, rather than that you give her to that useless
slave, the worthless and troublesome soldier’s servant,
who doesn’t have so much as a lead coin in his
private funds today.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">It’s strange that you don’t remember your duty in your<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">260</span><span class="br"></span>
old age.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">How so?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">Because, if you were doing the right and proper thing,
you’d let me look after the female slaves, which is <span class="italic">my</span> job.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">Why the hell do you want to give her to the shield-bearer?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">Because in fact we ought to help our only son.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">But even though he’s our only one, he’s no more my only
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">265</span><span class="br"></span>son than I am his only father. It’s more appropriate for
him to make a concession to my wishes than for me to
make one to his.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">You’re looking for trouble, my good man.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lys</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) She’s got wind of it, I can feel it. (<span class="italic">to Cleostrata,
nervously</span>) I?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">cleo</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, you. Why are you stuttering? Why do you desire that
match so eagerly?</p></div>
