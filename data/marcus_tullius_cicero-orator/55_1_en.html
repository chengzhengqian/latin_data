<p>a statement above what could actually occur<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_414_a" id="target_note_LCL342_414_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; his language will often have a significance deeper than his actual words<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_414_b" id="target_note_LCL342_414_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; there will be passages in a lighter vein,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_414_c" id="target_note_LCL342_414_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and a portrayal of life and manners.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_414_d" id="target_note_LCL342_414_d"><sup>d</sup></a> In the employment of resources like these—you see what a mass of material is available—all the brilliance of style should be employed.</p>
<p>But these figures can win the praise at which we <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">140</span><span class="br"></span> aim only by being properly arranged, and, as it were, bound together into a neat structure of words. When I consider that I must next speak about this matter, I am disturbed, partly by the considerations noted above,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_414_e" id="target_note_LCL342_414_e"><sup>e</sup></a> but more so by the following. For the thought occurred to me that there might be found, not only envious men—and the world is full of them—but even admirers of my success, who will think that it ill becomes one whose achievements have been praised more highly than those of any other man by the senate with the full approval of the Roman people to write so much about the technique<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_415_f" id="target_note_LCL342_415_f"><sup>f</sup></a> of oratory. If I had no answer to make to these except that I am unwilling to refuse the request of Marcus Brutus, this would be a sufficient excuse; I should be granting the just and honourable request of a very dear friend and a most distinguished man. But if I were to profess that I <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">141</span><span class="br"></span> would instruct students of oratory, and explain to them the roads which lead to eloquence—I only wish I could!—what reasonable critic would find fault with me? Will anyone ever doubt that in peaceful civil life eloquence has always held the chief place in our state, and jurisprudence has been of secondary</p>
