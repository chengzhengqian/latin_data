<p>importance? The reason is that the former brings with it a large measure of popularity, glory and power; the latter brings instruction in prosecution of suits and in securing bonds and warranties. Jurisprudence does indeed often ask aid from eloquence, and when opposed by eloquence can scarcely defend its own province and territory. Why, then, has it <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">142</span><span class="br"></span> always been honourable to teach civil law, and why have the houses of distinguished jurisconsults been thronged with pupils, while a man would be severely criticized if he trained young men for oratory or helped them in this? If it is wrong to speak ornately, let us expel eloquence entirely from the state; but if it adorns not only its possessor but the whole community, why is it shameful to learn what it is honourable to know? Why is it not glorious to teach that which it is most excellent to know?</p>
<p>“But the one is customary,” you will say; “the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">143</span><span class="br"></span> other is a new thing.” I grant the truth of the objection, but there is a reason for both facts. For all that the student of law needed was to listen to the jurisconsult as he rendered his opinions, so that the teachers set aside no time for teaching as such, but were able to satisfy both students and clients at the same time. In the case of the orators, their hours at home were spent in studying and preparing cases, their time in the forum was devoted to pleading, all the rest of their day was given to recruiting their strength; hence what time had they left for training or teaching? Moreover, I am inclined to think that most Roman orators had more talent than training; consequently they were better able to speak than to lay down precepts; but with us perhaps just the contrary is true.</p>
