If he had ever begun to sing in the Asiatic manner, in a whining voice with violent modulations, who would have put up with him? Rather I might say, who would not have cried “Put him out”?</p>
<p>Those speakers, then, who conform to the refined <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> and scrupulous Attic taste, must be considered to speak in Attic style. There are many kinds of Atticists: but these of our day<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_324_b" id="target_note_LCL342_324_b"><sup>b</sup></a> apprehend the nature of one kind only. They think that the only one who attains the Attic norm is he who speaks in rough and unpolished style, provided only that he is precise and discriminating in thought.

On the other hand, we must concede that ornate, vehement and eloquent language is found in the Attic orators, or else deny that Aeschines and Demosthenes are Attic.
