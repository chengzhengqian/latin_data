<p>transferred. Aristotle, however, classifies them <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">94</span><span class="br"></span> all under metaphor and includes also the misuse of terms, which they call κατάχρησις or “catachresis,” for example, when we say a “minute” mind instead of “small”; and we misuse related words on occasion either because this gives pleasure or because it is appopriate. When there is a continuous stream of metaphors, a wholly different style of speech is produced; consequently the Greeks call it ἀλληγορία or “allegory.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_374_a" id="target_note_LCL342_374_a"><sup>a</sup></a> They are right as to the name, but from the point of view of classification Aristotle does better in calling them all metaphors. The Phalerian uses these very frequently, and they are attractive to a degree; and although he has many metaphors, yet the cases of metonymy are more numerous than in any other orator. To the same <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">95</span><span class="br"></span> oratorical style—I am discussing the mean and tempered style—belong all figures of language, and many of thought. This speaker will likewise develop his arguments with breadth and erudition, and use commonplaces without undue emphasis. But why speak at length? It is commonly the philosophic schools which produce such orators<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_374_b" id="target_note_LCL342_374_b"><sup>b</sup></a>: and unless he be brought face to face with the more robust speaker, the orator whom I am describing will find approval on his own merits. It is, as a matter <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">96</span><span class="br"></span> of fact, a brilliant and florid, highly coloured and polished style in which all the charms of language and thought are intertwined. The sophists are the source from which all this has flowed into the forum, but scorned by the simple and rejected by the grand, it found a resting-place in this middle class of which I am speaking.</p>
