Those who have <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> gained power in one or another of these three styles have had a great name as orators, but it is open to question whether they have attained the result which we desire. We see, to be sure, that there have been some whose speech was ornate and weighty, and also shrewd and plain. Would that we could find an example of such an orator among the Romans! It would be fine not to seek our models among foreigners, but to be content with our own. But I recall that in that dialogue which I published <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">23</span><span class="br"></span> under the title of <span class="italic">Brutus</span>, though I paid high tribute to Romans, both to encourage others and because I loved my own people, still I placed Demosthenes far above all others,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_321_b" id="target_note_LCL342_321_b"><sup>b</sup></a> as one whom I might consent to identify with that ideal eloquence, not with that which I had myself found in anyone. No one has ever excelled him either in the powerful, the adroit or the tempered style. For this reason we must advise those whose misguided views have been spread abroad, who desire to be called “Atticists” or insist that they speak in the Attic style,—we must advise them to admire that man above all who, I am sure, was as Attic as Athens itself. Let them learn what is Attic, and measure eloquence by his strength, not by their own weakness. At the present time one praises only what <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">24</span><span class="br"></span> one hopes to be able to imitate. However, as these are men of high ambition but poor judgement, I think it not out of place to explain to them the true glory of Atticism.</p>
