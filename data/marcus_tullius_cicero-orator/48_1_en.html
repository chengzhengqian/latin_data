term for this is αὔξησις or “amplification.” Though <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">126</span><span class="br"></span> the latter should be spread equally throughout the whole of the speech, yet it will be especially noteworthy in the “commonplaces,” so called because they seem to be the same in many causes. They should, however, be appropriate to each particular cause. And in fact that part of the speech which deals with a general principle often includes the whole case. For whatever that part may be called that deals with the central point of the controversy, which the Greeks call κρινόμενον or the issue, ought to be treated in such a way as to transfer the subject to the realm of universals and bring about a discussion of a general principle. The only exception to this is when the trial is concerned only with a question of fact, which is customarily investigated by means of conjecture. The orator will treat these topics, not in <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">127</span><span class="br"></span> the fashion of the Peripatetics—to them belongs a graceful method of philosophical discussion which as a matter of fact goes back to Aristotle—but with somewhat greater vigour; and general remarks about the subject will be adapted in such a way as to say much quietly in favour of the defendant, and harshly against the opponents. There is no limit to the power of an oration to exalt a subject or render it contemptible. This must be done in the midst of arguments, whenever an opening is offered to amplify or disparage; and there is almost unlimited opportunity for it in the peroration.</p>
