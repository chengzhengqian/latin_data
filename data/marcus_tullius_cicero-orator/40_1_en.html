What mighty applause greeted the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">107</span><span class="br"></span> following passage from a speech of my youth<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_384_a" id="target_note_LCL342_384_a"><sup>a</sup></a> on the punishment of parricides, which somewhat later I came to feel was not sufficiently mellowed. “What indeed is so common as breath to living creatures, earth to the dead, the sea to those tossed on the waves, the shore to shipwrecked mariners?
