<p class="noindent">Therefore let us use the good old Latin words, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">164</span><span class="br"></span> rather than the magnificent Greek ones, unless, perchance, one might be ashamed to have written the passage beginning</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">qua tempestate Paris Helenam.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_442_ba" id="target_note_LCL342_442_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">No, let us rather imitate this latter style, and avoid the roughness of such lines as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">habeo ego istam perterricrepam,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">versutiloquas malitias.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_443_c" id="target_note_LCL342_443_c"><sup>c</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>But we shall use design not only in the collocation of words, but also in rounding off the sentence; this was the second point on which we said the judgement of the ear is required. Sentences are rounded off either by the arrangement of words,—spontaneously, as it were,—or by using a certain class of words in which there is an inherent symmetry. If they have similar case-endings, or if clauses are equally balanced, or if contrary ideas are opposed, the sentence becomes rhythmical by its very nature, even if no rhythm is intended. It is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">165</span><span class="br"></span> said that Gorgias was the first to strive for this sort</p>
