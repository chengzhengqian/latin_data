<p>But Ennius uses it only once; Scipio invicte<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_426_a" id="target_note_LCL342_426_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; another example can be cited from my own verse:</p>

<p>Our poets would not have permitted this very often, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">153</span><span class="br"></span> but the Greeks are accustomed even to praise it.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_426_c" id="target_note_LCL342_426_c"><sup>c</sup></a> But why confine the discussion to vowels? Consonants were frequently omitted in contractions, for greater smoothness, as, for example <span class="italic">multi’ modis</span> (for <span class="italic">multis modis), in vas’ argenteis</span> (for <span class="italic">in vasis argenteis), palm’ et crinibus</span> (for <span class="italic">palmis et crinibus), tecti’ fractis</span> (for <span class="italic">tectis fractis</span>). What greater freedom could be taken with language than to shorten men’s names to make them more compact. Thus, as <span class="italic">duellum</span> becomes <span class="italic">bellum</span>, and <span class="italic">duis, bis</span>, so they called that Duellius who defeated the Carthaginians at sea, Bellius, though all his ancestors had been called Duellii. Moreover words are often contracted, not for convenience, but merely for the sake of sound. How was the name of your ancestor changed from Axilla<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_427_d" id="target_note_LCL342_427_d"><sup>d</sup></a> to Ala except from a desire to avoid a harsh-sounding letter? The same letter is removed by refined Latin speech from <span class="italic">maxillae, taxilli, vexillum</span> and <span class="italic">pauxillum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_427_e" id="target_note_LCL342_427_e"><sup>e</sup></a></span> They were also very ready to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">154</span><span class="br"></span> combine words by blending, <span class="italic">e.g. sodes</span> for <span class="italic">si audes</span>, and <span class="italic">sis</span> for <span class="italic">si vis</span>.

Servilius Ahala. This is the normal spelling of the name which may have been pronounced Ala in Cicero’s time. Ala, “wing,” is from *aksla, and axilla is a diminutive from the same stem, but they are not related to Ahala. This etymology was, however, not Cicero’s own: the Fasti Consulares Capitolini has the name Axilla as trib. mil. for 418 <span class="sc">b.c.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL342_427_d').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL342_427_e"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL342_427_e" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">e</sup>Giving malae, tali, velum and paulum.
