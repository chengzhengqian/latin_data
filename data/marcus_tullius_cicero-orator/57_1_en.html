<p>“But,” you will say, “there is no distinction in teaching.” <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">144</span><span class="br"></span> Of course not, if you teach like a schoolmaster; but if by advice, by exhortation, by inquiry, by sharing your knowledge, if at times even by reading aloud to them or listening to their reading, if you could really improve men by some teaching of this sort, I cannot understand why you should decline to do so. Surely it is honourable to teach the formula for surrendering one’s rights; is it not equally honourable to teach the means of retaining and defending these rights?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_418_aa" id="target_note_LCL342_418_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>“But,” you will say, “even men who are ignorant of <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">145</span><span class="br"></span> the law profess themselves jurisconsults, whereas the very men who have attained eloquence nevertheless pretend that they have no ability in it.” The reason is that practical knowledge is pleasing to men, but a clever tongue suspect. For all that, can eloquence be hidden, or does what it tries to conceal really escape notice, or is there any danger that anyone will think in connexion with this great and glorious art that it is a disgrace to teach others what it was highly honourable for himself to learn? Others may perhaps be <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">146</span><span class="br"></span> more cautious; I have always been perfectly frank in acknowledging that I have been a student. How could I conceal the fact, when I left home as a youth and crossed the seas to engage in these studies; when my house was filled with learned men, my conversation bore some marks perhaps of learning, and my books were in general circulation? Why should I blush, except, perhaps, because I had not made enough progress?</p>
<p>This may be true; still there was more distinction</p>
