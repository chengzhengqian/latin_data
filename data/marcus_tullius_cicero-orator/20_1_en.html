style also. If style, then, makes so much difference in philosophy, where the attention is concentrated on the meaning, and words as such are not weighed, what must we think of the importance of style in suits at law which are wholly swayed by oratorical skill? On this point I judged from your letter, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">52</span><span class="br"></span> Brutus, that you did not seek my opinion of oratorical perfection in invention and disposition, but I thought you wished to know what I considered the best oratorical style. A hard task, I swear; indeed the hardest of all. For not only is language soft, pliant and so flexible that it follows wherever you turn it, but also the varieties in ability and taste have produced styles widely different. Fluency and <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">53</span><span class="br"></span> volubility please those who make eloquence depend on swiftness of speech; others like clearly marked pauses, and breathing spells. Could two things be more different? Yet there is something good in each. Some spend their labour on smoothness and uniformity, and on what we may call a pure and clear style; others affect a harshness and severity of language and an almost gloomy style. And so, according to our previous division of orators into three classes,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_345_a" id="target_note_LCL342_345_a"><sup>a</sup></a> those who aim to be impressive, or plain, or moderate, there are found to be as many kinds of orators as we said there were styles of oratory.</p>
<p>Since I have begun to carry out my task somewhat <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">54</span><span class="br"></span> more fully than you requested—you asked only about the use of language, but I included a brief treatment of invention and arrangement in my answer—so now I shall speak not merely about the method of expression, but also about the manner of delivery.</p>
