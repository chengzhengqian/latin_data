If, however, anyone likes a loose style let him by all means use it, but in the manner of one who should take apart the shield of Phidias: if any one ever takes it apart, he destroys the beauty of the composition, but not the charm of the several pieces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_506_b" id="target_note_LCL342_506_b"><sup>b</sup></a> In Thucydides, for example, I miss only the periodic structure, the ornaments are there.
