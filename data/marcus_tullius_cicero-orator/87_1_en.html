place? Throughout the whole period. What produces the pleasure? The same phenomena as in verse; theory sets down the exact measure of these, but without theory the ear marks their limits with unconscious intuition.</p>
<p>But enough concerning the nature of rhythm; the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">204</span><span class="br"></span> next topic is the use, and this must be treated in greater detail. The question here is whether rhythm is to be used throughout the whole of that rounded form of expression which the Greeks call the “period,” and to which we apply the terms <span class="italic">ambitus, circuitus, comprehensio, continuatio</span>, or <span class="italic">circumscriptio</span>, or whether it is to be used only at the beginning, or at the end, or in both places. In the second place, since rhythm seems to be one thing, and a rhythmical quality another, what the distinction is. Thirdly, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">205</span><span class="br"></span> should the period be divided into equal <span class="italic">cola</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_478_a" id="target_note_LCL342_478_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in all rhythms, or should some be shorter and some longer; and when should this be done and why? Which <span class="italic">cola</span> are to be used for rhythmical effect, several or only one, the unequal or the equal ones, and when should we use one and when the other? Which rhythms are combined most aptly, and how is it done; or is there no distinction on this point? And most important of all, in what manner does prose become rhythmical? We must also explain the origin of the regular <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">206</span><span class="br"></span> pattern of language; we must discuss how long it is appropriate to make the periods, and about their <span class="italic">cola</span> and <span class="italic">commata,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_479_b" id="target_note_LCL342_479_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span> and we must inquire whether these have one form and length or several, and if several, where, when and what kind should be used. Finally we must explain the utility of the whole business of rhythm—a subject with wide implications;</p>
