plainer than the grandest style which we shall presently discuss. In this style there is perhaps a minimum of vigour, and a maximum of charm. For it is richer than the unadorned style, but plainer than the ornate and opulent style. All the ornaments <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">92</span><span class="br"></span> are appropriate to this type of oration, and it possesses charm to a high degree. There have been many conspicuous examples of this style in Greece, but in my judgement Demetrius of Phalerum led them all. His oratory not only proceeds in calm and peaceful flow, but is lighted up by what might be called the stars of “transferred” words (or metaphor) and borrowed words. By “transferred” I now mean, as often before, words transferred by resemblance from another thing in order to produce a pleasing effect, or because of lack of a “proper” word; by “borrowed”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_372_a" id="target_note_LCL342_372_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I mean the cases in which there is substituted for a “proper” word another with the same meaning drawn from some other suitable sphere. It is, to be sure, a “transfer” when Ennius says <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">93</span><span class="br"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent4">I am bereft of citadel and town,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_372_b" id="target_note_LCL342_372_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">but a “transfer” of quite a different kind from that which he uses when he says</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>The latter is called ὑπαλλαγή or “hypallage” by the rhetoricians, because as it were words are exchanged<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_373_d" id="target_note_LCL342_373_d"><sup>d</sup></a> for words; the grammarians call it μετωνυμία or “metonymy” because nouns<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_373_e" id="target_note_LCL342_373_e"><sup>e</sup></a> are</p>
