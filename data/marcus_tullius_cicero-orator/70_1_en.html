<p>of symmetry. An example of it is found in the following passage from my oration <span class="italic">In Defence of Milo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_444_a" id="target_note_LCL342_444_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span>: “For this law, gentlemen of the jury, is not written, but born; we did not learn, receive and read it, but we seized, plucked and wrested it from Nature herself; for this we were not taught, but made; we know it not by training, but by instinct.” The nature of this passage is such that, as the words match those which they ought to match, we recognize that the rhythm was not studied, but was the natural result of the thought. The same effect is <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">166</span><span class="br"></span> produced by balancing opposites, as in the cases which produce not merely rhythmical prose but even verse:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">eam quam nihil accusas damnas—<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_444_b" id="target_note_LCL342_444_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">(one would say <span class="italic">condemnas</span> if one desired to avoid verse)—</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line indent4">bene quam meritam esse autumas</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">dicis male merere?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">id quod scis prodest nihil; id quod nescis obest.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">The juxtaposition of opposing ideas makes the verse. It would likewise be rhythmical in prose: What you know does not help; what you do not know greatly hinders. Clauses of this sort which the Greeks call ἀντίθετα or “antithetical,” in which contrasted ideas are set off one against the other, necessarily produce a rhythm in prose even if it is not intentional. The ancients even before the time of Isocrates were <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">167</span><span class="br"></span> fond of this style—Gorgias particularly so; in his prose symmetry of itself frequently produces rhythm. We, too, have made frequent use of this style, for example in the fourth speech of the <span class="italic">Accusation<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_445_c" id="target_note_LCL342_445_c"><sup>c</sup></a></span>:</p>
