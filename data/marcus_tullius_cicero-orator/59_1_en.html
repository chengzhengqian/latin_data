<p>The arrangement of words in the sentence has <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">149</span><span class="br"></span> three ends in view: (1) that final syllables may fit the following initial syllables as neatly as possible, and that the words may have the most agreeable sounds; (2) that the very form and symmetry of the words may produce their own rounded period; (3) that the period may have an appropriate rhythmical cadence. Let us consider the nature of the first; it requires great care to see that there is a joining or structure, as it were, and yet that it is not carried out with too great exactness; the labour would then be endless and silly. That is the point in the style of Albucius which Lucilius makes Scaevola satirize wittily in these lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">How charmingly he <span class="italic">fait ses phrases</span>, set in order like the lines</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Of mosaic in a pavement, and his inlaid work he twines.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_423_a" id="target_note_LCL342_423_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">I would not have the structure obtrude itself in such <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">150</span><span class="br"></span> trivialities; but a practised pen will nevertheless easily find the method of composition. For as the eye looks ahead in reading, so in speaking the mind will foresee what is to follow, so that the juxtaposition of final syllables with initial may not cause harsh or “gaping”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_423_b" id="target_note_LCL342_423_b"><sup>b</sup></a> sounds. For however agreeable or important thoughts may be, still if they are expressed in words which are ill arranged, they will offend the ear, which is very fastidious in its judgement. The Latin language, indeed, is so careful on this point that no one is so illiterate as to be unwilling</p>
