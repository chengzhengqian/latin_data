<p>his work shows even an excess of rhythm. Furthermore Gorgias, as I said before, was the first to employ clauses of equal length, with similar endings, and with antithesis, which, by their very nature, generally have a rhythmical cadence even if this is not intended, but he used these devices somewhat immoderately. (However, as has been said before, this is the second of the three heads under arrangement of words.) Both Gorgias and Thrasymachus <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">176</span><span class="br"></span> were predecessors of Isocrates, so that his superiority to them was not in originality but in adaptation. For as he is more moderate in the use of metaphor and in forming new words, so he is more restrained in his rhythms. But Gorgias is too fond of this style, and uses these “embroideries”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_454_a" id="target_note_LCL342_454_a"><sup>a</sup></a> (his own word for it) too boldly.

Moreover, Isocrates himself as he grew older—he lived to be nearly a hundred—had gradually relaxed the extreme strictness of his rhythm, as he says in his address to Philip of Macedon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_454_b" id="target_note_LCL342_454_b"><sup>b</sup></a> written in his ripe old age; in this he says that he was less attentive to rhythm than had been his custom. This indicates that he had corrected, not only his predecessors, but also himself.</p>
<p>Since as I have said we consider these men just <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">177</span><span class="br"></span> named as the authors and inventors of well-knit prose, and the origin has been discovered, we must now seek for the cause. This is so obvious that I wonder the ancients did not notice it, especially since, as will happen, they often accidentally produced well-knit, rhythmical sentences. When this struck the minds and ears of men and they could appreciate that the product
