<p>are best adapted to verse; therefore just as we avoid verses in prose, so we must shun a succession of these feet. For prose is a different thing from verse and utterly hostile to it; the paean, however, is poorly adapted to verse, and therefore prose welcomes it gladly. Ephorus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_470_a" id="target_note_LCL342_470_a"><sup>a</sup></a> however, does not recognize that the spondee, which he avoids, is equivalent to the dactyl, which he approves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_470_ba" id="target_note_LCL342_470_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> For he thinks that feet are to be measured by the number of syllables, not by their intervals.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_471_c" id="target_note_LCL342_471_c"><sup>c</sup></a> He does the same with the tribrach, which has the same time and intervals as the iambus, but is bad in prose if placed last, because it is better to have words end with a long syllable. These remarks of Aristotle about the paean are repeated by Theophrastus and Theodectes. My own feeling, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">195</span><span class="br"></span> however, is that all kinds of feet are mingled and jumbled together in prose, for we could not avoid the critic’s censure if we used the same feet all the time; for prose ought not to be rhythmical as a poem is, nor entirely without rhythm as is the speech of the vulgar—for one is too strict and confined, so that it seems artificial; the other is too loose, so that it seems rambling and vulgar. You would not like the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">196</span><span class="br"></span> one and would hate the other. Prose, then, as I have said before, should be tempered by an admixture of rhythm; it should not be loose, nor wholly rhythmical; the paean is to be the principal measure, because that is the opinion of our greatest authority, but we should combine this with the other rhythms which he disregards.</p>
