deficiency. There is, in fact, more good in words and ideas, in which they excel, than in a rhythmical sentence ending, which they lack. The rhythmical ending was a later invention, which I believe the ancients would have used if it had been known and employed in their day. We see that after its invention, all great orators<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_448_a" id="target_note_LCL342_448_a"><sup>a</sup></a> employed it.

Relying on this objection, those friends of yours themselves deliver broken and choppy sentences and upbraid those who produce rounded and finished periods. Their criticism would be justified if the words were silly and the ideas trifling; but if the subject-matter has merit, and the words are well chosen, why should they prefer to let the sentence limp or stop short rather than keep pace with the thought? As a matter of fact this invidious rhythm does nothing except to form the words into a well-knit sentence.
