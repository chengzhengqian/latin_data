<p>“Compare this peace with that war, the arrival of this praetor with the victory of that general, this abandoned retinue with that invincible army, the praetor’s lust with the general’s restraint; you will say that Syracuse was founded by its conqueror, and captured by its governor.”</p>
<p>Now that we have learned the nature of this kind <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">168</span><span class="br"></span> of rhythm, let us proceed to explain the third topic<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_446_a" id="target_note_LCL342_446_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—the well-knit rhythm of prose.

They pride themselves on the names of their ancient models. Antiquity does carry authority in the precedents it furnishes, as old age does in respect of years; and this authority has great weight with me.
