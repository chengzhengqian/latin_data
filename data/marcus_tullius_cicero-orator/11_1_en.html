ignoramuses. Those who follow Lysias at least follow a pleader of sorts, not indeed grand and stately, but for all that refined and precise, and able to hold his own famously in the law-court. Thucydides, on the other hand, gives us history, wars and battles—fine and dignified, I grant, but nothing in him can be applied to the court or to public life. Those famous speeches contain so many dark and obscure sentences as to be scarcely intelligible, which is a prime fault in a public oration. Are men so perverse as to live on <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">31</span><span class="br"></span> acorns after grain has been discovered? Are we, then, to suppose that the diet of men could be improved by the assistance of the Athenians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_326_a" id="target_note_LCL342_326_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but that their oratory could not?

Consequently he has <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">32</span><span class="br"></span> never been classed as an orator, nor, to tell the truth, would his name be known unless he had written his history, although he was of noble birth and had been honoured with public office.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_327_c" id="target_note_LCL342_327_c"><sup>c</sup></a> No one, however, succeeds in imitating his dignity of thought and diction, but when they have spoken a few choppy, disconnected phrases, which they could have formed well enough without a teacher, each one thinks himself a regular Thucydides. I have even seen a man who wished to resemble Xenophon, whose style is indeed sweeter than honey, but far removed from the wrangling of the forum.</p>
