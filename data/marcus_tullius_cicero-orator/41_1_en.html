<p>the privilege of not employing in all passages alike the same impassioned style but of changing their tone frequently, even of passing over at times to the language of everyday life, while I myself am never to depart from that most vehement and impassioned manner? But why do I cite poets of divine genius? We have seen actors whose superiors in their own class cannot be found, who not only gained approval in utterly different parts while confining themselves to their own proper spheres of tragedy and comedy, but we have also seen a comedian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_387_a" id="target_note_LCL342_387_a"><sup>a</sup></a> highly successful in tragedy and a tragedian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_387_a" id="target_note_LCL342_387_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in comedy. Should I <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">110</span><span class="br"></span> not take equal pains? When I say “I,” I mean “you,” Brutus; for in my case what was to be has been wrought out long ago; but will <span class="italic">you</span> plead all cases in the same manner? Or will you refuse to take a certain class of cases? Or in the same cases will you always keep to the same high pitch without variation? Take Demosthenes, for example, whose statue in bronze I lately saw among those of yourself and your kinsmen when I visited you at your Tusculan villa, placed there, I am sure, because you admire him; he yields nothing to Lysias in simplicity, nothing to Hyperides in refinement of expression and subtlety, nothing to Aeschines in smoothness and brilliance of language. Many of his speeches <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">111</span><span class="br"></span> are simple throughout—the one <span class="italic">Against Leptines</span> is an example; many are impassioned throughout, as certain of the <span class="italic">Philippics</span>; many are varied—the one against Aeschines regarding <span class="italic">Malfeasance in the Embassy</span>, and the one against Aeschines <span class="italic">In Defence</span>
