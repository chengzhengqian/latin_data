<p>because it consists of two long syllables, it seems rather heavy and slow; still it has a steady movement that is not without dignity, especially in <span class="italic">cola</span> and <span class="italic">commata</span> where the heaviness and sluggishness compensate for the small number of feet. (In mentioning these feet as used in clausulae, I am not speaking only of the last foot; I include at least the next to the last, and often the one before that.) The <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">217</span><span class="br"></span> iambus composed of a short and a long, or the equivalent of the trochee, the tribrach with three shorts which is equivalent in time but not in number of syllables, or even the dactyl composed of a long and two shorts if placed in the penultimate position, reaches the end of the sentence rapidly enough if the last foot is a trochee or spondee. For it makes no difference which is used at the close of the sentence. But these same three feet make a bad cadence if any of them is placed last, except when the final dactyl stands for a cretic; for it never makes any difference whether the dactyl or cretic be used last, because even in verse the quantity of the final syllable is a matter of indifference. For this reason the one <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">218</span><span class="br"></span> who said that the form of the paean with the last syllable long was better adapted to the cadence, did not realize the real situation, since the length of the final syllable has nothing to do with the case.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_488_aa" id="target_note_LCL342_488_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> Some even hold the paean to be a rhythm and not a foot, because it has more than three syllables. It is in fact, as all the ancients agreeâ€”Aristotle, Theophrastus,
