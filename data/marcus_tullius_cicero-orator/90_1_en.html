when we have to name something which had had no name because the thing itself was unknown, we are compelled to invent a new term or to use a metaphor.</p>
<p>We shall presently see the fitting way to speak in <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">212</span><span class="br"></span> <span class="italic">cola</span> and <span class="italic">commata</span>; now we must explain how many methods there are of varying the periods and rhythmical clausulae. In general the rhythm flows onward from the beginning, sometimes faster if the feet are short, sometimes slower if they are long. A vigorous dispute requires speed, exposition requires a slower rhythm. The period may end in several ways; Asia prefers the one called ditrochee in which the last two feet are trochees, each composed of a long and a short. (We have to make this explanation because the same feet receive different names from different people.)<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_484_a" id="target_note_LCL342_484_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Surely the ditrochee is not <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">213</span><span class="br"></span> of itself vicious in the clausula, but in prose rhythm nothing is so vicious as to keep the rhythm always the same. In itself it has a splendid cadence; therefore we have all the more reason to fear satiety or monotony. I was standing in an assembly when the tribune of the people, Gaius Carbo the younger, spoke in these words: <span class="italic">O Marce Druse, patrem appello</span>â€”here two <span class="italic">commata</span>, each consisting of two feet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_484_b" id="target_note_LCL342_484_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; then in <span class="italic">cola: tu dicere solebas sacram esse rem publicam;</span> this has <span class="italic">cola</span> of three feet each<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_484_ca" id="target_note_LCL342_484_ca"><sup>c</sup></a>; then followed the period:
