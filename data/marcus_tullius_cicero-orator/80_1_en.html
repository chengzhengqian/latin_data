We may be sure there are no rhythms other than those used by poetry, because the kinds of rhythms are strictly limited. They all fall into one of three classes. For the foot, which is employed in rhythms, is of three types; it divides into two equal parts, or one part is twice as long as the other, or half again as long. Examples of these are, respectively, the dactyl, the iambus, the paean.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_464_ba" id="target_note_LCL342_464_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> How can these feet fail to occur in prose?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_465_c" id="target_note_LCL342_465_c"><sup>c</sup></a> And when they are arranged in a systematic order the effect must be rhythmical. However, the question is raised as to <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">189</span><span class="br"></span> which rhythm or which rhythms it is most desirable to use. All of them may occur in prose, as appears from the fact that we often make verses unintentionally in delivering a speech. This is very reprehensible, but we do not notice or listen to ourselves; as a matter of fact it is almost impossible to avoid senarii and Hipponacteans, for our speech consists largely of iambi.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_465_d" id="target_note_LCL342_465_d"><sup>d</sup></a> The auditor, however, recognizes these verses readily; for they are of the</p>
