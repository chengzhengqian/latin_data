<p>that rhetoric is the counterpart of logic, the difference obviously being that rhetoric was broader and logic narrower.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_390_a" id="target_note_LCL342_390_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I therefore expect this perfect orator of ours to be familiar with all the theory of disputation which can be applied to speaking; this subject, as you well know from your training along this line, has been taught in two different ways.
