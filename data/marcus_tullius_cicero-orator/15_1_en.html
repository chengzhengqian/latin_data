<p>that he strove eagerly for these effects,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_334_a" id="target_note_LCL342_334_a"><sup>a</sup></a> for he had written, not for a trial in court, but to entertain the audience. Thrasymachus of Calchedon and Gorgias <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">39</span><span class="br"></span> of Leontini are said to have been the first to practise this and, after them, Theodorus of Byzantium and many others called “cunning artificers of speech” by Socrates in the <span class="italic">Phaedrus</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_334_b" id="target_note_LCL342_334_b"><sup>b</sup></a> They show many clever phrases but these are like a new and immature product, choppy, resembling verselets, and sometimes over-ornamented.
