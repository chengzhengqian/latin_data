Theodectes, Ephorus—the one foot best adapted to the beginning or the middle of the sentence; they think it is best at the close, too; but here the cretic appears to me better.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_490_aa" id="target_note_LCL342_490_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> The dochmius, however, composed of five syllables, short, two longs, short and a long, for example, ămīcōs tĕnēs, is fitted for any position, provided it is used only once. If repeated or used in a series it makes an obvious and too conspicuous rhythm. Therefore if <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">219</span><span class="br"></span> we use these many different variations, what we are doing so studiously will not be plainly discovered, and satiety or monotony will be forestalled.</p>
<p>Furthermore, prose becomes rhythmical, not only by the use of rhythms, but also because of the arrangement of words and a kind of symmetry, as has been said before<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_491_b" id="target_note_LCL342_491_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; by arrangement, I mean, when the words are so placed that the rhythm seems not to be planned but to come naturally; in the following passage from Crassus for example: “<span class="italic">Nam ubi lubido dominatur, innocentiae leve praesidium est,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_491_c" id="target_note_LCL342_491_c"><sup>c</sup></a></span> the order of the words produces a rhythm without any apparent effort on the part of the orator. Consequently if the early writers,—I mean Herodotus, Thucydides and all that period—wrote anything rhythmical, this was due, I am sure, not to purposeful rhythm, but to the arrangement of the words. Moreover, there are certain figures of speech which <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">220</span><span class="br"></span> involve such a symmetry that rhythm is the necessary result.
