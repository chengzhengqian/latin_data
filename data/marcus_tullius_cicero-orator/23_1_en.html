of passion, and dropping it in calmer moods. Furthermore, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">60</span><span class="br"></span> what dignity and charm are contributed by the countenance, which has a rôle second only to the voice. After ensuring that the expression shall not be silly or grimacing, the next point is the careful control of the eyes. For as the face is the image of the soul, so are the eyes its interpreters, in respect of which the subjects under discussion will provide the proper limits for the expression of joy or grief.</p>
<p>We must now turn to the task of portraying the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">61</span><span class="br"></span> perfect orator and the highest eloquence. The very word “eloquent” shows that he excels because of this one quality, that is, in the use of language, and that the other qualities are overshadowed by this.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_351_a" id="target_note_LCL342_351_a"><sup>a</sup></a> For the all-inclusive word is not “discoverer,” or “arranger,” or “actor,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_351_b" id="target_note_LCL342_351_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but in Greek he is called ῥήτωρ<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_351_c" id="target_note_LCL342_351_c"><sup>c</sup></a> from the word “to speak,” and in Latin he is said to be “eloquent.” For everyone claims for himself some part of the other qualities that go to make up an orator, but the supreme power in speaking, that is eloquence, is granted to him alone.</p>
<p>Certain philosophers, to be sure, had an ornate <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">62</span><span class="br"></span> style,—for example Theophrastus received his name from his divinely beautiful language,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_351_d" id="target_note_LCL342_351_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and Aristotle challenged even Isocrates, and the Muses were said to speak with the voice of Xenophon, and Plato was, in dignity and grace, easily the first of all writers or speakers—yet their style lacks the vigour and sting</p>
