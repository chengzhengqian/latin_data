<p>You have my judgement, Brutus, of what an orator <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">237</span><span class="br"></span> should be; you will follow this if you approve, or keep your own, if you have a different one. I shall not quarrel with you over this, nor shall I ever assert that this ideal which I have championed so vigorously in this book is truer than yours. For it is possible that you may have one and I another, or that my own ideal might be different at different times. Not only in this matter which is concerned with popular approval and the pleasure of the ear, both of which are of little weight in forming a true judgement, but even on the most important subjects I have never found anything more substantial to hold to or use in forming my opinions, than what seemed most like the truth; the truth itself is hidden in obscurity. If my arguments <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">238</span><span class="br"></span> find less favour with you, I would ask that you consider that a task was undertaken which could not be fulfilled, or that in my desire to yield to your request, my reluctance to refuse led me to write unwisely.</p>
