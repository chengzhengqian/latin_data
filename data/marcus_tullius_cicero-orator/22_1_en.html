There is, moreover, even in speech, a sort of singing—I do not mean this “epilogue”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_348_a" id="target_note_LCL342_348_a"><sup>a</sup></a> practised by Phrygian and Carian rhetoricians which is almost like a <span class="italic">canticum</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_348_b" id="target_note_LCL342_348_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in a play—but the thing which Demosthenes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_348_ca" id="target_note_LCL342_348_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> and Aeschines mean when they accuse each other of vocal modulations.
