<p>Now we must discuss the proper combinations of these feet one with another (like the art of mixing the purple dye<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_472_a" id="target_note_LCL342_472_a"><sup>a</sup></a>) and also consider which are best fitted to each kind of speech. The iambus, for example, is most frequent in passages of a plain, simple conversational type; the paean is used in <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">197</span><span class="br"></span> the more elevated style, and the dactyl in both. Therefore in a long speech with varying moods these rhythms must be mingled and blended. If this is done the audience will scarcely notice the striving for a pleasing effect, and the pains spent in polishing<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_473_b" id="target_note_LCL342_473_b"><sup>b</sup></a> the oration; which will also be better concealed if we use weighty language and thoughts.

However, if it were absent, their <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">198</span><span class="br"></span> pleasure in the words and ideas would be lessened. Yet, to be sure, this course of the rhythm—I mean in prose, for the case is quite otherwise in verse—is not such that there is nothing unmetrical; for that would be a poem; but every passage which does not halt or waver, but advances steadily and uniformly is considered rhythmical. And in spoken prose, a passage is regarded as rhythmical not when it is composed entirely of metrical forms, but when it comes very close to being so. That is why prose is harder to write than verse, because in the latter there is a definite and fixed law which must be followed. In a speech, however, there is no rule except that the</p>
