in the long way is to consider whether there is such a thing as rhythmical prose at all; for some think there is not, because there is nothing definite about it as there is in verse, and because the supporters of rhythm cannot render a reason for its existence. In the second place, if there is rhythm in prose, what is its nature, whether it have one or many forms? Does it consist of the rhythms of poetry, or does it belong in a different class? If it is the rhythm of poetry, what type or which types are used? For some think only one is used in prose, others several, still others think that all are used. Again, whether there be one or more, are they used equally in every kind of prose—for there is one kind of prose for narrative, another for persuasion, another for exposition—or are different rhythms adapted to each kind of prose?
