<p>The eloquence of orators has always been controlled by the good sense of the audience, since all who desire to win approval have regard to the goodwill of their auditors, and shape and adapt themselves completely according to this and to their opinion and approval. Accordingly, Caria, Phrygia and Mysia, where there <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> is the least refinement and taste, have adopted a rich and unctuous diction which appeals to their ears. But their neighbours, the Rhodians, though separated only by a narrow strait, never approved this style, Greece showed it even less favour, and the Athenians utterly repudiated it, holding with sound and discerning judgement that they could listen to nothing that was not pure and well chosen.

Aeschines, then, thought that not even Demosthenes was “Attic.” It is easy, indeed, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">27</span><span class="br"></span> to criticize some flaming word, if I may use this expression, and to laugh at it when the passion of the moment has cooled. That is why Demosthenes in excusing himself jestingly says that the fortunes of Greece did not depend on his using this word or
