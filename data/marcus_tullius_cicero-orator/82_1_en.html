<p>spondee and tribrach. For as the paean has three shorts and the dactyl two, he thinks that because of the shortness and swiftness of the syllables the words flow along more rapidly and that the contrary is true of the spondee and tribrach.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_468_a" id="target_note_LCL342_468_a"><sup>a</sup></a> As the one is composed entirely of long syllables and the other of shorts, the latter makes the style too rapid, the former, too slow, and neither has the due proportion. However the authorities first mentioned are wrong, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">192</span><span class="br"></span> and Ephorus is at fault. For those who neglect the paean fail to see that they are neglecting the rhythm which is pleasantest but at the same time most stately. Aristotle held quite a different opinion; he thought the heroic measure<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_468_b" id="target_note_LCL342_468_b"><sup>b</sup></a> too lofty for prose, and the iambic too close to ordinary conversation. That is, he approves neither a low mean style, nor one too lofty and bombastic, but will nevertheless have it dignified, in order to arouse greater admiration in the audience. The tribrach, however, which occupies <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">193</span><span class="br"></span> the same time as the trochee, he calls a cordax because its shortness and brevity is undignified.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_469_c" id="target_note_LCL342_469_c"><sup>c</sup></a> He consequently approves of the paean, and says all men use this rhythm without realizing what they are doing; but that it is a third form midway between the other two, and that these feet have the proportions 3:2, or 2:1 or 2:2. The other writers whom I mentioned above were thinking only of convenience, and not at all of dignity.
