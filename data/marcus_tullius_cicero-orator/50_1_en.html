filled the forum with wailing and lamentation—but the juror must be made to be angry or appeased to feel ill will or to be well disposed, he must be made to feel scorn or admiration, hatred or love, desire or loathing, hope or fear, joy or sorrow. The sterner of these various emotions may be exemplified from the <span class="italic">Accusation</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_404_a" id="target_note_LCL342_404_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the milder from my speeches for the defence. For there is no way in which the <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">132</span><span class="br"></span> mind of the auditor may be aroused or soothed that I have not tried—I should say brought to perfection, if I really thought so, and if it were true I should not fear to be called conceited. But, as I said before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_404_b" id="target_note_LCL342_404_b"><sup>b</sup></a> it is no great intellectual gift, but a vigorous spirit which inflames me to such an extent that I am beside myself; and I am sure that the audience would never be set on fire unless the words that reached him were fiery. I should cite examples from my own speeches if you had not read them: I should cite the speeches of others,—in Latin if I could find any, in Greek if it were fitting to do so.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_404_c" id="target_note_LCL342_404_c"><sup>c</sup></a> But there are only a few of Crassus’s speeches, and they are not forensic; nothing is extant of Antonius, of Cotta or of Sulpicius. Hortensius used to speak better than his written speeches would indicate. But let <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">133</span><span class="br"></span> us be content to surmise the importance of this vigour which we desire, since we have no examples; or if we must have examples, let us cite Demosthenes, in particular the continuous passage in the oration <span class="italic">In Defence of Ctesipkon</span> beginning with his discussion of his acts, his counsel and his services to the state.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_405_d" id="target_note_LCL342_405_d"><sup>d</sup></a> This speech certainly conforms so closely to the ideal which is in our minds that no greater eloquence need be sought.</p>
