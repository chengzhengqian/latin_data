<p>matched with words of similar endings, whatever is elaborated in this way generally has a rhythmical cadence. We discussed this form or type above with examples. This gives abundant opportunity to avoid always ending in the same way. However, these rules are not so strict and binding that we cannot relax them at will. It makes a vast difference whether prose is rhythmical, that is <span class="italic">resembling</span> definite rhythms, or is composed entirely of definite rhythms; if the latter occurs it is an intolerable fault; if the former does not occur, the style is disordered, unpolished, and vague.</p>
<p>But since in actual practice in court the rhythmical <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">221</span><span class="br"></span> period is certainly to be used not only not frequently, but even sparingly, we must, it seems, examine the nature of the <span class="italic">incisa</span> and <span class="italic">membra</span> which I mentioned above<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_492_a" id="target_note_LCL342_492_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; for these form the largest part of the speech in actual practice. The full comprehensive period consists of approximately four parts which we call <span class="italic">membra</span>, so as to satisfy the ear and not be too long or too short. However, it happens occasionally or rather I should say frequently that one must stop sooner, or continue farther in order to prevent the ear from being seemingly cheated by the brevity or wearied by the length. But I am considering the average; I am not discussing verse, and prose is somewhat less restricted in form. The full period, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">222</span><span class="br"></span> then, consists of four members each approximately equal to a hexameter verse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_493_b" id="target_note_LCL342_493_b"><sup>b</sup></a> In each of these lines appear the binding knots which we unite in a</p>
