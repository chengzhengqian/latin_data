<p>I would never have undertaken through fear of this age so unfriendly to virtue, had I not considered it base not to yield when you urged so strongly and kindled the memory of one so dear to me.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_330_a" id="target_note_LCL342_330_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I call you to witness that it was because you asked me that I dared, albeit reluctantly, to write this book. For I wish that you should share the reproach with me, so that if I cannot defend myself against so weighty a charge, you may take the blame for imposing an excessive task on me, as I take the blame for accepting it. However, any error in my judgement will be counterbalanced by the glory of dedicating the work to you.</p>
<p>It is always difficult to describe the “form” or <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">36</span><span class="br"></span> “pattern” of the “best” (for which the Greek word is χαρακτήρ<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_331_b" id="target_note_LCL342_331_b"><sup>b</sup></a>) because different people have different notions of what is best. “I like Ennius,” says one, “because his diction does not depart from common usage.” “I like Pacuvius,” says another, “for all his lines are embellished and carefully elaborated; in Ennius there is much careless work.” Suppose that another likes Accius. There is a difference of opinion, as there is in the case of Greek authors, and it is not easy to explain which type is the most excellent. In the case of painting, some like pictures rough, rude and sombre, others on the contrary prefer them bright, cheerful and brilliantly coloured. How can you draw up a rule or formula, when each is supreme in its own class, and there are many classes? This misgiving, however, did not deter me from my undertaking; I held that in all things there is a certain “best,”</p>
