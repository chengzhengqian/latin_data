sentences more neatly for all that. In the case of other writers, particularly the “Asiatics” who are slaves to rhythm, you could find in them some silly words inserted just to fill out the rhythm. Some also in the vicious manner which stems from Hegesias, cutting and breaking up their rhythms, fall into an insipid style that resembles verselets. A third fault <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">231</span><span class="br"></span> is found in those leaders of Asiatic rhetoric, the brothers Hierocles and Menecles, who are, in my opinion, not at all contemptible. For although they are far removed from the type of real speeches and from the Attic norm, they compensate for this by ease, or I might say, fluency. But they had no variety; nearly all their sentences ended in the same way. The orator who avoids these faults, who does not transpose words so that it seems to be done intentionally, who does not stuff in words as though to fill up the cracks, who does not cut up and weaken his sentence in his pursuit of short rhythms, who does not use the same form of rhythm without variation, will avoid nearly all faults. For we have had a great deal to say about the virtues to which such vices are obviously opposites.</p>
<p>The importance of well-knit speech may be demonstrated <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">232</span><span class="br"></span> if you break up the well-ordered structure of a careful orator by changing the order of the words: the whole thing would be ruined, as, for example, in the following words from my <span class="italic">Defence of Cornelius</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_502_a" id="target_note_LCL342_502_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the whole succeeding passage: <span class="italic">Neque me divitiae movent, quibus omnis Africanos et Laelios multi venalicii mercatorḗsquĕ sŭpĕ|rā́rūnt<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_503_b" id="target_note_LCL342_503_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span>: change this only a trifle, so that it reads <span class="italic">multi superarunt mercatores</span></p>
