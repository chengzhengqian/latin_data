he may possibly employ more frequently because it is of the commonest occurrence in the language of townsman and rustic alike. The rustics, for example, say that the vines are “bejewelled,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_366_a" id="target_note_LCL342_366_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the fields “thirsty,” the crops “happy,” the grain “luxuriant.” Any of these metaphors is bold enough, but there <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">82</span><span class="br"></span> is a similarity to the source from which the word is borrowed, or if a thing has no proper term the borrowing seems to be done in order to make the meaning clear, and not for entertainment. The restrained speaker may use this figure a little more freely than others, but not so boldly as if he were speaking in the grandest style.
