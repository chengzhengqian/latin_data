you must consider how you wish to end the sentence. This is no less true of the other ornaments of prose than of rhythms, since we are doing the same thing as the poets, but in prose we avoid the semblance of poetry. For in both prose and poetry it is a question of material and treatment: by material I mean the words, by treatment, the arrangement of the words. There are three parts in each section: in words we have metaphors, new formations and archaisms (for I need not mention words used in their “proper” sense); under the heading of arrangement the topics are, as we have said,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_476_a" id="target_note_LCL342_476_a"><sup>a</sup></a> euphony, symmetry and rhythm. The poets, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">202</span><span class="br"></span> however, are more assiduous in both and take greater liberties in the former; they employ metaphors more frequently, and also more boldly, and use archaisms and new words more freely. The same is not true of rhythm, in which they are constrained to yield to necessity, as it were. However, we can appreciate that in prose and poetry these<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_476_b" id="target_note_LCL342_476_b"><sup>b</sup></a> are not greatly different, nor utterly unconnected. Consequently rhythm is not so conspicuous in prose as in verse, and what is called rhythm in prose does not always arise from metre, but at times from either the symmetry or the structure of the language.</p>
<p>Wherefore if the question be asked, which rhythms <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">203</span><span class="br"></span> are used in prose, the answer is, “all, but one is better suited to one part and one to another.” The place? In all parts of a phrase. What is the origin? In the pleasure of the ear. The method of construction? This will be discussed elsewhere, since this is a matter of practice, and that is the fourth and last topic of our discussion. For what purpose is it used? To give pleasure. When? Always. In what
