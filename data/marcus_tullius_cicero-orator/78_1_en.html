For the decision is given by our senses; and in such a case it is unfair not to acknowledge the occurrence of the phenomenon, even if we are unable to discover its cause. Verse itself, as a matter of fact, is not recognized by abstract reason, but by our natural feeling: later on theory measured the verse and showed us what happened. The art of poetry, therefore, arose from observation and investigation of a phenomenon of nature. But in poetry the presence of rhythm is more obvious, although in certain metres, if the musical accompaniment be taken away, the words seem to lack rhythm; this is particularly true of the best of the poets whom the Greeks call “lyric”; deprive them of the musical accompaniment and almost nothing but bare prose remains.
