of life; the other, which they call παθητικόν or “relating to the emotions,” arouses and excites the emotions: in this part alone oratory reigns supreme. The former is courteous and agreeable, adapted to win goodwill; the latter is violent, hot and impassioned, and by this cases are wrested from our opponents; when it rushes along in full career it is quite irresistible. My ability is mediocre or even <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">129</span><span class="br"></span> less than that, but I have always used a vigorous style, and by this kind of oratory I have often dislodged opponents.
