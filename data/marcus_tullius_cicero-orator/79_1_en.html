There are, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">185</span><span class="br"></span> speaking generally, two things which lend flavour to prose, pleasing words and agreeable rhythms. Words furnish a certain raw material which it is the business of rhythm to polish. But here as in other lines of activity the discoveries arising from necessity were of earlier origin than those prompted by pleasure. Therefore Herodotus and writers of his <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">186</span><span class="br"></span> age and of earlier times had only accidental and unintentional rhythms, and the early theorists have left for us many precepts about diction, but absolutely nothing about rhythm. For what is easier and more necessary is always learned first. Consequently metaphors, coined words and compounds were easily understood because they were taken from the customary speech of the day. But rhythm was not ready-to-hand, and had no necessary connexion or kinship with prose. Accordingly it was noted and understood somewhat late; it brought as it were the athletic training in graceful movement, and added the finishing touches to prose style. Therefore if one passage is constrained and choppy, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">187</span><span class="br"></span> and another is diffuse and flowing, this cannot proceed from the nature of the letters, but from the varied arrangement of long and short intervals; and since prose, which is an intertwining and blending of these intervals, is at times sedate, and at times rapid, such a phenomenon as this must depend on rhythm; for the period, <span class="italic">i.e. circuitus</span>. as I have already termed it repeatedly, is carried along by the rhythm in a vigorous movement until it comes to the end and stops.</p>
