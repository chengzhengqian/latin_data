<p>ridicule. Of this latter there are several kinds,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_370_a" id="target_note_LCL342_370_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but now we are discussing another subject. We here <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">88</span><span class="br"></span> merely suggest that the orator should use ridicule with a care not to let it be too frequent lest it become buffoonery; nor ridicule of a smutty nature, lest it be that of low farce; nor pert, lest it be impudent; nor aimed at misfortune, lest it be brutal, nor at crime, lest laughter take the place of loathing; nor should the wit be inappropriate to his own character, to that of the jury, or to the occasion; for all these points come under the head of impropriety. He will also avoid far-fetched jests, and those not <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">89</span><span class="br"></span> made up at the moment but brought from home; for these are generally frigid. He will spare friends and dignitaries, will avoid rankling insult; he will merely prod his opponents, nor will he do it constantly, nor to all of them nor in every manner.

Not all of them, however, are humorous. Lysias is adequate and so is Hyperides; Demades is said to have excelled them all, Demosthenes is considered inferior. Yet it seems to me that none is cleverer than he; still he is not witty so much as humorous; the former requires a bolder talent, the latter a greater art.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL342_370_ba" id="target_note_LCL342_370_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>The second style is fuller and somewhat more <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">91</span><span class="br"></span> robust than the simple style just described, but
