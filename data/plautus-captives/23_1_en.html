<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">These are words; I want to test you in your efforts and
deeds. And insofar as I said less about you than I wanted,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">430</span><span class="br"></span>
I want you to pay attention. Don’t be angry with me because
of these words. But please consider that you’re being
sent home on my pledge on bail and that my life is put
down here as a security for you; so don’t forget me as
soon as you get out of sight, while leaving me here as a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">435</span><span class="br"></span>
slave in slavery instead of you; and don’t consider yourself
free and desert your pledge without making an effort
to save me by getting this man’s son back here. Remember
that you’re being sent off on a bail of twenty minas.
Make sure you’re absolutely faithful, take care you don’t
have fluctuations in your faithfulness: I know my father<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">440</span><span class="br"></span>
will do everything he ought to; save me as your friend for
good and find this man (<span class="italic">points to Hegio</span>) as your friend,
the one you’ve already found to be so. I entreat you by
your right hand, holding you back with my right hand:
don’t be less faithful to me than I am toward you. Pay attention.
Now <span class="italic">you</span> are my master, <span class="italic">you</span> are my patron, <span class="italic">you</span>
are my father. I commend my hopes and my fortunes<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">445</span><span class="br"></span>
to you.</p></div>

your commands as accomplishments?</p></div>
