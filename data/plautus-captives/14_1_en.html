<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">philoc</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">approaching Hegio</span>) Well, I can see that you took precautions
that we shouldn’t require looking for: we’re
completely surrounded by fetters and guards.</p></div>

hardly cautious even when he is cautious; even when he
thinks that he’s been cautious such a cautious person has
often been caught out. But don’t I have good reason to
guard you carefully, since I paid such a high price for you

there are things I’d like to ask you in private. I don’t want
