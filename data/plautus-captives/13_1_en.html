<span class="italic">own</span> dear life cheap.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">philoc</span><p class="lineGroup">I know.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">But remember to know when you have what you want:
most people have the habit of being good while they’re
trying to achieve what they want for themselves, but of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">235</span><span class="br"></span>
turning from good to very bad and treacherous once they
have attained it.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">philoc</span><p class="lineGroup">Now I’m telling you how I want you to be toward me.
What I’m advising you I’d advise my own father. Well, if I
had a choice I’d call <span class="italic">you</span> my father: next to my real father
<span class="italic">you</span> are the closest thing to a father I have.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">philoc</span><p class="lineGroup">And that’s why I remind you more often to remember:
I’m not your master, but your slave. Now I beg you for
this one thing—since the immortal gods have shown us
their will, namely that I’ve <span class="italic">been</span> your master and that I’m
<span class="italic">now</span> your fellow servant; what I used to order you to do
before, as was my right, I’m now asking you by way of
entreaty—by our uncertain fortune, by my father’s goodness<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">245</span><span class="br"></span>
toward you, and by our shared slavery, which the
enemy’s power has inflicted on us: don’t honor me less
than when you were my slave and remember carefully
who you were and who you are now.</p></div>
