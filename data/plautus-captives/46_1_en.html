I just saw your son Philopolemus in the harbor, alive,
safe, and sound, in a swift-boat belonging to the state,
and there I also saw that young man from Elis together
with him, and your slave Stalagmus, who fled from home

He continues to swear by Proserpina, whose
Greek name is Cora/Core, but since Cora is also a Volscian town, he
turns to unusual oaths by Italian cities. Praeneste is modern Palestrina.
Signea, Frusino, and Alatrium are nowadays better known as Segni,
Frosinone, and Alatri.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL060_597_38a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
