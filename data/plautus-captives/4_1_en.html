<span class="italic">Philocrates</span>), the master he’d snatched when he was running
away from home. After this man bought him, he gave him to his
son here (<span class="italic">points to Philocrates</span>) as his own because their age was<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">20</span><span class="br"></span>
roughly the same. Well, you understand how he lost one son.
Now that the Aetolians are fighting with the Eleans, his other<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span>
son’s taken prisoner, as so happens in a war. A doctor, Menarchus,
bought him in the same place, in Elis. This man here began
to buy Elean prisoners of war in the hope of finding someone
he could exchange his son for, I mean the prisoner; he
doesn’t know that this chap here at home (<span class="italic">points to Tyndarus</span>) is
his son as well. And since he heard yesterday that an Elean<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">30</span><span class="br"></span>
knight of the highest rank and the highest family connections
had been taken prisoner, he didn’t spare his wallet so long as he
could spare his son. In order to be able to get him back home
more easily, he bought these two from among the spoils from
the quaestors.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL060_513_2" id="target_note_LCL060_513_2">

themselves how this slave here (<span class="italic">points to Tyndarus</span>) can send
his master home. So they interchange clothes and names among
each other. That one (<span class="italic">points to Tyndarus</span>) calls himself Philocrates,
this one (<span class="italic">points to Philocrates</span>) Tyndarus. That one’s posing
as this one and this one as that one today. And this chap here<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">40</span><span class="br"></span>
 (<span class="italic">points to Tyndarus</span>) will carry out this trick brilliantly today;
he’ll set his master free and by the same stroke he will, unknowingly,
save his brother and let him return home to his father as a
free man: just as often before in many places a person’s done<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">45</span><span class="br"></span>
more good unknowingly than knowingly. But in their scheme
they’ve unknowingly prepared, contrived, and devised their
trick in such a way, all at their own suggestion, that this chap
here (<span class="italic">points to Tyndarus</span>) is remaining in slavery at his father’s.
