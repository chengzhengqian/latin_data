<p>Those two prisoners you can see standing here, they’re both
standing, not sitting, because the people back there are standing
(<span class="italic">points to some spectators standing at the back</span>). You’re my

chap (<span class="italic">points to Tyndarus</span>) is his own father’s slave at home, and
