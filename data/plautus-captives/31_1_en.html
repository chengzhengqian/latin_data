freedom here.</p></div>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ari</span><p class="lineGroup">What’s that? How this thug is now making a fool of you,
Hegio! He himself is a slave and he never had a slave<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">580</span><span class="br"></span>
besides himself.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">Just because you yourself are a pauper in our country and
don’t have anything to live on at home, you want everyone
to be found to resemble you. No big surprise: it’s
typical of wretched people to be spiteful and jealous of
respectable ones.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ari</span><p class="lineGroup">Hegio, do make sure you don’t continue to trust this man
blindly. As I can see it, he has indeed already given you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">585</span><span class="br"></span>
some trouble. I’m not at all happy about him saying he’ll
ransom your son.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">I know you don’t want it done; but I’ll carry it through
nevertheless if the gods help me. I’ll restore that man to
this one here (<span class="italic">points to Hegio</span>), and this one here will in
turn restore me to my father in Elis. That’s why I sent
Tyndarus to my father.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ari</span><p class="lineGroup">No, you yourself are him. Besides you there isn’t any<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">590</span><span class="br"></span>
slave with that name in Elis.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">Are you continuing to reproach me for being a slave,
which became my lot because of armed conflict?</p></div>
