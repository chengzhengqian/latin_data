don’t think that all sorts of profit are useful for a man under
all circumstances; I know that profit has already corrupted
many men. In some cases, in fact, it’s better to
make a loss than a profit. I hate gold: it has often led many
people to act badly on many issues. Now pay attention so
that you know what I think as well as I do. My son was<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">330</span><span class="br"></span>
taken prisoner and is a slave there, at your place, in Elis.
If you return him to me, you needn’t give me a single sesterce
in addition and I’ll send you and this chap (<span class="italic">points to
Philocrates</span>) away from here. On no other terms can you
get away.</p></div>
