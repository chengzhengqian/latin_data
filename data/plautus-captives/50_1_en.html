I’ve already heard enough about your hard times, which
you told me about at the harbor. Let’s turn to this matter.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">930</span><span class="br"></span>

<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">philoc</span><p class="lineGroup">Well then; I kept my promise toward you and returned
this chap (<span class="italic">points to Philopolemus</span>) to you in freedom.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">Philocrates, you’ve made sure that I’ll never be able to
show you enough gratitude for your kindness toward me
and my son.</p></div>
