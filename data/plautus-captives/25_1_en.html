anything. And that one is most wretched who doesn’t
have anything to eat when he wishes to eat. Well, if I were
allowed to, I’d happily tear out this day’s eyes: it’s given all<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">465</span><span class="br"></span>
mortals such a supply of meanness. I haven’t seen a more

I approached young men on the market. “Hello there,” I
