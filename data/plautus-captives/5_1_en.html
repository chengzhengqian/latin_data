what little importance humans are when I think about it! For us
this will be fact, for you it will be fiction. But there’s still something
else I’d like to point out to you briefly. It’ll definitely be
worth paying attention to this play: it hasn’t been composed in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">55</span><span class="br"></span>
the hackneyed fashion or the same way as the others; there are
no dirty lines in it that are unfit to be repeated. Here there’s no
pimp perjuring himself, no bad prostitute, no boastful soldier.
Don’t be afraid because I said that the Aetolians are at war with
the Eleans: the battles will take place out there, off-stage. Well,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">60</span><span class="br"></span>
it would almost be unfair if we were suddenly to try staging a
tragedy with our comedy get-up. So if anyone’s looking for a
battle scene, he’d better pick some quarrels. If he picks on a

know the mockers say that’s an absurd nickname, but I
claim it has a point; well, when a lover throws the dice at a
banquet, he shouts out his prostitute’s name. Is the prostitute’s
name shouted out or not? It clearly is. But when it<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">75</span><span class="br"></span>
comes to us hangers-on, people shout “out” even more
