anywhere. What was covered is uncovered, my tricks lie
open, the whole thing’s out. There’s no doubt about it: I’ll
die miserably and reach the end on account of master
and myself. Aristophontes here, who just came in, has
destroyed me. He knows me, he’s a friend and relative of
Philocrates’. Salvation herself cannot save me any longer,
if she wants to, and there is no opportunity, unless I think<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">530</span><span class="br"></span>

him? What will I deny or what will I admit? The whole
matter’s on uncertain ground. How could I be confident
about my situation? I wish the gods had destroyed you
before you disappeared from home, Aristophontes;
you’re turning the whole thing from settled back to unsettled.
This matter’s dead unless I find some shocking
trick for myself.</p></div>
