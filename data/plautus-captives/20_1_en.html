<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">approaching Philocrates</span>) May this turn out well for me, and for my son, and for you two: your new master wants
you to devote yourself faithfully to your old master’s
wishes: I’ve given you to him on a bail of twenty minas,
and he says he wants to send you off to his father so that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">365</span><span class="br"></span>
he, the father, can ransom my son there, so that an exchange
of our sons can take place between me and him.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">philoc</span><p class="lineGroup">My efforts are directed in both directions, toward you
and him. You can use me as a wheel: I will turn here or<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">370</span><span class="br"></span>
there, where you command.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">You benefit greatly from your own character since you’re
bearing your slavery as one ought to bear it. Follow me.
(<span class="italic">leads him to Tyndarus</span>) Here’s the man for you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Hegio</span>) I’m grateful to you for giving me the chance
and opportunity to send him back to my parents as a messenger.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">375</span><span class="br"></span>
He’ll bring a full and detailed account to my father
there, how I’m doing here and what I wish to be
done. (<span class="italic">to Philocrates</span>) Now the agreement between me
and him, Tyndarus, is that I can send you to Elis to my father
on bail; if you don’t return here, I have to give him<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">380</span><span class="br"></span>
twenty minas for you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">philoc</span><p class="lineGroup">I think that’s a good agreement: your father is expecting
either me or some other messenger who is coming to
him from here.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">Well then, I’d like you to pay attention to what I want you
to report home to my father from here.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">philoc</span><p class="lineGroup">Philocrates, as I’ve done so far, I’ll continue to do this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">385</span><span class="br"></span>
eagerly: with heart, mind, and ears I will look for and
strive after what benefits you most.</p></div>
