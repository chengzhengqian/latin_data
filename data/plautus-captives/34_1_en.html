<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, I was.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ari</span><p class="lineGroup">No, he wasn’t, he’s fooling you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Aristophontes</span>) How do <span class="italic">you</span> know? Were you perhaps
my mother’s midwife, as you dare to state this so boldly?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">630</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ari</span><p class="lineGroup">When I was a boy I saw you as a boy.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">And now that I’m a grown-up I see you as a grown-up.
There you go, tit for tat! You wouldn’t meddle with my
business if you did the right thing. I’m not meddling with
yours, am I?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">Was his father Goldtreasure-Goldwinson?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ari</span><p class="lineGroup">No, he wasn’t, and I’ve never heard that name before this
day. Philocrates’ father was Theodoromedes.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">635</span><span class="br"></span>
</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) I’m dying thoroughly. Calm down, my heart . . .
damn it all, hang yourself! You are jumping up and down,
while <span class="italic">I,</span> poor devil, can barely stand for fear.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">Is it absolutely clear that this man was a slave in Elis and
that he isn’t Philocrates?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ari</span><p class="lineGroup">So absolutely that you’ll never find it to be otherwise. But<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">640</span><span class="br"></span>
where is he now?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">Where I want him to be least and where he wants to be
most. But are you quite sure?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ari</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, I’m telling you that this has been investigated and
checked for you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">For certain?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">ari</span><p class="lineGroup">Yes, I assure you, you won’t find anything more certain
that this certainty. Philocrates has been my friend since
we were both boys.</p></div>
