<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">You’re asking, you sower, hoer, and greatest reaper of
crimes?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">Didn’t you want to say “harrower” earlier? Farmers always
harrow before they hoe.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">Look at that, how boldly he’s stood up to me!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">An innocent and blameless slave ought to be bold, especially<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">665</span><span class="br"></span>
in front of his master.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to overseers</span>) Tie up his hands tightly, will you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">I’m yours, you can even have them cut off. But what’s the
matter? Why are you angry with me?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">Because as far as you could you hacked me and my hopes<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">670</span><span class="br"></span>
to pieces and tore my chances to shreds through your
wicked and false swindles. You’ve destroyed all my plans
and calculations by snatching Philocrates from me
through your swindles. I believed that he is a slave and
that you are free; so you said yourselves and interchanged
your names.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">I admit that everything was done as you say, and that he
left you because of my tricks, my effort, and my cunning.
Seriously, I ask you, is that why you’re angry with me<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">680</span><span class="br"></span>
now?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">heg</span><p class="lineGroup">You’ll pay for doing this with the hardest torture.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">tyn</span><p class="lineGroup">So long as I don’t die for bad deeds, I don’t care. If I die
here and if he doesn’t return as promised, this deed of
mine will still be worth remembering when I’m dead:
that I made it possible for my master, who was a prisoner,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">685</span><span class="br"></span>
to return from slavery and the enemy to his own land and
his father as a free man, and that I preferred to put my
own life at risk rather than let him die.</p></div>
