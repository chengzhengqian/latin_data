There was also a delegation from King Eumenes that included his brother Athenaeus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_353_191" id="target_note_LCL313_353_191"><sup>191</sup></a> which came to complain that the garrisons were not being withdrawn from Thrace and also that reinforcements for Prusias’ campaign against Eumenes had been sent to Bithynia by Philip.</p>

All these complaints had to be addressed by Demetrius who was then quite young.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_353_192" id="target_note_LCL313_353_192"><sup>192</sup></a> It was not easy for him to remember either all the charges that were brought or the responses needing to be made to them.

They forthwith demanded the scroll be produced and then allowed Demetrius to read it out.</p>
