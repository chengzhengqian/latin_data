This was justified by the services of Eumenes’ father, Attalus, during the war that the Roman people fought against Philip himself, or else by Eumenes’ own services, as he had shared in all the hardships and perils of the war with Antiochus on land and on sea. Besides, added the spokesmen, Eumenes actually had an advance judgment of the ten commissioners on the matter: since they had granted him the Chersonese and Lysimachia, they had surely also granted him Maronea and Aenus, which by their very proximity were virtually attachments to the larger gift.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_287_99" id="target_note_LCL313_287_99"><sup>99</sup></a> In Philip’s case, by what service to the Roman people or by what territorial right was he justified in imposing garrisons on these city-states when they were so far removed from the boundaries of Macedonia?
