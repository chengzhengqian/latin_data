<p>When the Thessalians had been heard, the Perrhaebians argued that Gonnocondylus, which Philip had renamed Olympias,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_283_93" id="target_note_LCL313_283_93"><sup>93</sup></a> belonged to Perrhaebia and should be returned to them; and the same demand was made for Malloea and Ericinium.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_283_94" id="target_note_LCL313_283_94"><sup>94</sup></a> The Athamanians asked for the restoration of their independence, and for the fortresses of Athenaeum and Poetneum.</p>

He protested that the Thessalians had captured Menelais in Dolopia, which had been part of his realm, by force of arms and likewise that Petra in Pieria had been taken by the same Thessalians and by the Perrhaebians.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_283_95" id="target_note_LCL313_283_95"><sup>95</sup></a> They had also annexed Xyniae, which was clearly an Aetolian town, he said; and Parachelois,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_283_96" id="target_note_LCL313_283_96"><sup>96</sup></a> which had been under the rule of Athamania, had also been unlawfully made subject to the Thessalians. As for the charges brought against him—ambushing envoys and ports being frequently used or abandoned—the one, that he be accountable for the harbors that merchants and sailors headed for, was absurd, while the other was out of line with his character. For years now embassies had never stopped bringing charges against him, either before the Roman commanders or before the senate in Rome; but which of them, he asked, had ever been mistreated by him, even verbally? It was said that envoys had once been ambushed while on their way to Quinctius; but information on what happened to them was not added.

The Thessalians were impudently and grossly exploiting the kindness of the Roman people
