In addition, he stormed six towns of the Ingauni. He took many thousands of prisoners in them; and he beheaded forty three who had been responsible for the war.</p>
<p>The time for the elections was now at hand. Because his brother Publius Claudius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_305_122" id="target_note_LCL313_305_122"><sup>122</sup></a> was standing for the consulship, Claudius reached Rome before Sempronius, to whom sortition had assigned supervision of the elections. Publius had as his rivals among the patricians Lucius Aemilius, Quintus Fabius and Servius Sulpicius Galba,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_305_123" id="target_note_LCL313_305_123"><sup>123</sup></a> seasoned candidates who, after earlier defeats, were now seeking an office they felt to be all the more rightfully theirs for having been initially refused them. The race between the four candidates was made even closer because election of more than one patrician was not permitted.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_305_124" id="target_note_LCL313_305_124"><sup>124</sup></a> There were influential plebeian candidates, as well: Lucius Porcius, Quintus Terentius Culleo and Gnaeus Baebius Tamphilus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_305_125" id="target_note_LCL313_305_125"><sup>125</sup></a> After earlier defeats these, too, were now hoping to gain at last an office that had been long in coming to them. The one new candidate among all of them was Claudius. The general belief was that the men indubitably destined for office were Quintus Fabius Labeo and Lucius Porcius Licinus. But the consul Claudius was dashing around the whole Forum with his brother and without his lictors, despite protests from opponents and most of the senate, who told him that he should remember that he was first and foremost a consul of the Roman people
