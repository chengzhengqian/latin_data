have stripped from me what I held either by my own right or through your beneficence—which is what you are doing now? The city-states of the Macedonians, which you admit were part of my realm, are not being restored to me. Eumenes is coming to plunder me as if I were Antiochus, and (for heaven’s sake!) is using the decree of the ten commissioners as cover for his shameless perversion of justice—when it is by this that he can be most effectively refuted and shown to be in the wrong. There is an absolutely explicit and clear statement in it that the Chersonese and Lysimachia are awarded to Eumenes.

If you are set on harassing me as a private enemy and an enemy of your people, carry on with the actions you have begun; but if you have some respect for me as an ally and a king well-disposed to you, I beg you not to judge me deserving of such ill-treatment.”</p>

If the states in question had been granted to Eumenes by decree of the ten commissioners, they said, they were not altering anything; and if Philip had captured them in war he would have them as the prize of victory under the rules of war. If neither condition obtained, their decision was that judgment of the issue be reserved for the senate, and so that everything should remain open for discussion the garrisons stationed in the cities involved should be withdrawn.
