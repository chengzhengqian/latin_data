The king had there seized merchant vessels that could bypass Thebes and make for Demetrias, and he had thereby diverted all maritime trade to that port. And now he did not even stop short of violating ambassadors, who were sacrosanct under international law—he had set an ambush for them when they were going to see Titus Quinctius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_281_92" id="target_note_LCL313_281_92"><sup>92</sup></a> The result was that all Thessalians had been thrown into such panic that nobody dared open his mouth in his own community or in the communal meetings of the nation.
