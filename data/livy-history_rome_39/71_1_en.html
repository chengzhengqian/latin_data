raised the question of their own provinces and those of the praetors. The praetors who had been elected were Gaius Valerius (the <span class="italic">flamen Dialis,</span> who had also run for the office the previous year), Spurius Postumius Albinus, Publius Cornelius Sisenna, Lucius Pupius, Lucius Iulius, and Gnaeus Sicinius. The consuls were assigned Liguria as their province with the same armies that Publius Claudius and Lucius Porcius had commanded. The Spanish provinces along with their armies were retained for the praetors of the previous year without sortition. A sortition was authorized for the praetors, with the proviso that the <span class="italic">flamen Dialis </span>be in any case assigned as his province one of the jurisdictions at Rome<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_349_183" id="target_note_LCL313_349_183"><sup>183</sup></a> (and he drew that concerning foreigners.)

If armed intervention were required to restrain them, Iulius was to inform the consuls, one of whom, the senate had decided, was to lead his legions against the Gauls.</p>
<p>At the end of the previous year an election had been held to appoint an augur to replace the late Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus, and Spurius Postumius Albinus had been elected.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_349_185" id="target_note_LCL313_349_185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>
