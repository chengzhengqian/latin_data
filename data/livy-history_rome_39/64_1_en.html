In combat he was a valiant soldier with a brilliant record in many famous battles, and he was also an outstanding general after he reached the higher offices. In peacetime, too, he was a great expert if consulted on the law and he displayed great eloquence if he had to plead a case. Nor was he simply one who, though his eloquence bloomed while he was alive, left no record of his speaking ability; in fact, his eloquence remains alive and vigorous, immortalized in all manner of written texts.
