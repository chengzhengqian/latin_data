Such were the considerations that particularly set Philip against the Romans; so one can see that war was not fomented by his son Perseus from a new set of motives but was for the reasons given handed down from the father to the son.</p>
<p>At Rome there was no idea of war with Macedon. The proconsul Lucius Manlius had returned from Spain; in the temple of Bellona<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_295_108" id="target_note_LCL313_295_108"><sup>108</sup></a> he requested a triumph of the senate and the extent of his achievements lent weight to his petition. What stood in the way was precedent: ancestral custom had established that nobody should triumph who had not brought his army home, unless he had passed on to his successor a province that had been totally subdued and pacified. Manlius was nonetheless granted the compromise honor of entering the city in ovation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_295_109" id="target_note_LCL313_295_109"><sup>109</sup></a> His procession included 52 golden crowns<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_295_110" id="target_note_LCL313_295_110"><sup>110</sup></a> as well as 132 lbs of gold and 16,300 lbs of silver. He also announced in the senate that his quaestor Quintus Fabius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_295_111" id="target_note_LCL313_295_111"><sup>111</sup></a> was bringing 10,000 lbs of silver and 80 lbs of gold, and that he would also deposit this in the treasury. </p>
<p>There was a dangerous slave revolt in Apulia that year. Lucius Postumius had Tarentum as his province, and he conducted a rigorous inquiry into a conspiracy of shepherds whose banditry had made roads and public pasture lands unsafe. He convicted some 7,000 men; and many of them fled from there and many were put to death. After being long delayed in the city conducting troop levies, the consuls eventually left for their provinces.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_295_112" id="target_note_LCL313_295_112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>
