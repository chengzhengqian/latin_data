 Lycortas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_315_134" id="target_note_LCL313_315_134"><sup>134</sup></a> called a session of the council so that the Achaeans would have arguments already prepared with which to meet them. There the issue of the Spartans was raised. Enemies before, the Spartans had now become their accusers, it was said, and there was danger of their being more to be feared in defeat than they had been in the war. Then the Achaeans had had the Romans as their allies,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_315_135" id="target_note_LCL313_315_135"><sup>135</sup></a> they reasoned; but at that moment those same Romans now looked more favorably on the Spartans than on the Achaeans. Even Areus and Alcibiades, both of them exiles who had been restored by the good offices of the Achaeans,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_315_136" id="target_note_LCL313_315_136"><sup>136</sup></a> had gone on a mission to Rome against the Achaean people, who deserved well of them for the favor they had received; and they had employed such vindictive language as to give the impression of having been driven from their country rather than restored to it!</p>

Before they could conduct any business, the Achaeans were panic-stricken at the thought of how one-sided the debate was going to be, because they could see Areus and Alcibiades—condemned to death by them at the last session of the council—now in the commissioners’ company. Not one of them dared open his mouth. Appius then revealed the senate’s displeasure over the grievances brought to it by the Spartans. First there was the slaughter at Compasium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_315_138" id="target_note_LCL313_315_138"><sup>138</sup></a> of the men who had come to defend themselves at Philopoemen’s summons.
