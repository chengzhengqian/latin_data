masses, terrified at the alarming prospect of a war coming from the Romans, looked on Demetrius with great favor as a peacemaker and at the same time they fully expected that he was marked out for the throne on his father’s death. For, although he was younger than Perseus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_371_211" id="target_note_LCL313_371_211"><sup>211</sup></a> they reasoned that he was the son of a legally married mother while Perseus was the son of a concubine; and that while the latter, born of a whore,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_371_212" id="target_note_LCL313_371_212"><sup>212</sup></a> had no physical characteristic clearly recalling his father, Demetrius bore a remarkable likeness to Philip.
