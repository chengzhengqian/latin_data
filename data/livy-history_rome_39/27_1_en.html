Should anyone consider that such a rite was a traditional and essential part of his religious observance and that he could not renounce it without sin and expiation, he was to make a declaration before the urban praetor and the praetor was to consult the senate. If he were granted permission by the senate when there was a quorum of one hundred, he could hold the rite as long as no more than five participants attended the sacrifice and there were no common funds, no master of ceremonies, and no priest.</p>

After this, on the motion of the consul Quintus Marcius, another senatorial decree was passed, adjoined to this one, that the matter of those whom the consuls had used as informers be referred untouched to the senate when Spurius Postumius returned to Rome after completing his investigations. The senators voted that the Campanian Minius Cerrinius be sent to Ardea for imprisonment,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_261_58" id="target_note_LCL313_261_58"><sup>58</sup></a> and that the magistrates of the Ardeans be warned to keep a particularly close watch on him, not only to prevent his escape but also so he should have no opportunity for suicide.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_261_59" id="target_note_LCL313_261_59"><sup>59</sup></a> Some time later Spurius Postumius came to Rome.

<p>that the urban quaestors pay each of the two 100,000 asses from the treasury;</p>
<p>that the consul discuss with the plebeian tribunes the matter of taking to the people at the earliest opportunity a proposal that Publius Aebutiusâ€™ military service be considered
