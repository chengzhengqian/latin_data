<p>“I do realize, Appius Claudius, that the language I have employed thus far is not that used by allies to allies, nor indeed that used by an independent people; really, it is the language of slaves arguing before masters. For if they were not just empty words that the herald used when you bade the Achaeans to be the first, ahead of all others, to accept their freedom,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_323_146" id="target_note_LCL313_323_146"><sup>146</sup></a> if a treaty was indeed ratified, and if our alliance and friendship are based on equality—then why do I not ask what you Romans did after capturing Capua,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_323_147" id="target_note_LCL313_323_147"><sup>147</sup></a> since you demand a reckoning of what we Achaeans did after defeating the Spartans in war?
