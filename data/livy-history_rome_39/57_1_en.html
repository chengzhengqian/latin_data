and the ancient system of Lycurgus and you tore down the walls. How can these two charges be brought against us by the same people? For the walls of Sparta were not built by Lycurgus; they were raised a few years ago for the purpose of quashing the Lycurgan system. It was the tyrants who put them in place in recent times to be a bastion and fortification for themselves, not for the state;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_321_143" id="target_note_LCL313_321_143"><sup>143</sup></a> and should Lycurgus rise from the dead today, he would be pleased with their destruction and would say he now recognized his homeland and the Sparta of old. You should</p>
<p class="noindent">not have waited for Philopoemen or the Achaeans; you yourselves, men of Sparta, should have dismantled and demolished with your own hands all the vestiges of tyranny. For these stood as the ugly scars of your enslavement. Though you had been free and without walls for almost eight centuries, and at times had even been the leaders of Greece,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_321_144" id="target_note_LCL313_321_144"><sup>144</sup></a> you were slaves for a hundred years,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_321_145" id="target_note_LCL313_321_145"><sup>145</sup></a> imprisoned by walls that were thrown around you like shackles. As for the abolition of the legal system, I personally think that it was the tyrants who deprived the Lacedaemonians of their ancient laws. We did not take their laws from them—for they did not have them—but gave them ours. Nor do I think we did badly by their state, since we made them part of our league and combined them with us so that the whole Peloponnese should be a unified body and one confederation. In my opinion, if we ourselves were living under one set of laws and had imposed another on them, <span class="italic">then</span> they could complain and be indignant at being unfairly treated.</p>
