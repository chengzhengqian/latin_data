Obliging, cheerful, kindly, temperate, you were always as ready to give advice as silent when you had given it. At once all the pride of your kin as presently their sorrow, you leave all desolate, my Glabrio, reft from us by untimely death: wife, children, father, mother, left—alas, under how many names were you lost to them!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_136_2" id="target_note_LCL096_136_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Long mourned by me, though never mourned enough, your name is here recorded for all time; and so, friend Glabrio, receive my sorrowful farewell!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Know</span> that these men, of whom you read in order after the exordium<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_137_3" id="target_note_LCL096_137_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of my book, were once teachers in my native place, some of grammar, some of rhetoric, and some of both. They are dead, and it is enough that I have recalled their memories. For the living praise is a lure: to but cry their names<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_137_4" id="target_note_LCL096_137_4"><sup>4</sup></a> will satisfy those within the tomb. Wherefore, do you, who in my pages read these mournful trifles, not look for pomp of words but for the affection wherewith my reverent care makes offering to famous and learned men, while it recalls the glories of my splendid native land.</p>
