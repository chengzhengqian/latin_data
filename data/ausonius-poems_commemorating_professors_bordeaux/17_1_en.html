You may have strayed away and spent your pains on a distant city, but the country of your birth resumes its right to you. And now your sons are following their father’s example, and adding to the renown of Narbo and of Rome with their learning. But why do we complain? After long years, will they or nill they, Fame will bring them also back to Bordeaux.</p>

<p>So far I have kept to the rule of commemorating my fellow-countrymen, whether they taught in our city or abroad. Yet it is no sin to couple with my countrymen a single stranger such as you, Staphylius, a son of Novem Populi. You were to me a father and an uncle, both in one, like a second Ausonius, like a second Arborius. As a grammarian you rivalled Scaurus and Probus; as a rhetorician, most ready; in history you knew all Livy and Herodotus. You knew every branch of learning and all the lore which Varro stored in his innumerable tomes. Your heart was golden, your tongue persuasive and your speech unflurried; no hesitating was there and yet no hurrying. In old age you were comely and distinguished in appearance; anger and grief were strangers to you, and your peaceful life had a befitting close.</p>
