<p><span class="sc">You</span> also shall be recalled by me, beloved Citarius, for you deserve to be praised amongst good grammarians. If the custom of past ages still obtained, you would have the renown of Aristarchus and Zenodotus among the Greeks. Even the Muse of Simonides of Ceos yields place to the odes which you composed in your early years. Born in a Sicilian town, you came a stranger to our city, but quickly made it the home of culture with your learning.

But be your place where it may, my sad lament shall recall your memory: early or late, homage paid to the dead </p></section><notes></notes></section>
