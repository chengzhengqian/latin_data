<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">X.—To the Latin Grammarians, Scholars of Bordeaux, Macrinus, Sucuro, Concordius, Phoebictus, Ammonius, and Anastasius, Grammarian of Poictiers</span></span></h2>
<p>Now, as the pious homage of my mournful task shall present each one, I will tell of those who, though of humble birth and rank and merit, instilled into the uncultured minds of the people of Bordeaux the love of letters.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span><p>Let Macrinus be named amongst these: to him I was entrusted first when a boy; and Sucuro, the freedman’s son, temperate and well-suited to form youthful minds. You too, Concordius, were another such, you who, fleeing your country, took in exchange a chair of little profit in a foreign town. Nor must I leave unmentioned the old man Phoebicius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_115_1" id="target_note_LCL096_115_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who, though the keeper of Belenus’ temple, got no profit thereby. Yet he, sprung, as rumour goes, from the stock of the Druids of Armorica (Brittany), obtained a chair at Bordeaux by his son’s help: long may his line endure!</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">35</span><span class="br"></span><p>I will sing of Ammonius also—for, indeed, it is a solemn duty to commemorate a grammarian of my own native place—who used to teach raw lads their alphabet:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_115_2" id="target_note_LCL096_115_2"><sup>2</sup></a> he had scant learning and was of an ungentle nature, and therefore—as was his due—was held in slight repute.</p>
