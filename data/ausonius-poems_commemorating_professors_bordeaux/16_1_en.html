And in due time your classes and lectures, thronged with crowds of boys, brought you the title of grammarian and wealth. But Fortune never favours a career of unvarying success, especially when she finds a man of a crooked nature. Howbeit, ’tis not for me to make heavier your destiny: my task is to recall it. It is enough to say that you lost all at one stroke; yet not your title also, whereof I do not rob you, but give you a place amongst grammarians of very scant deserving.</p>

Yet from that land, however far, your native place now brings you home, and after death claims you again </p></section><notes></notes></section>
