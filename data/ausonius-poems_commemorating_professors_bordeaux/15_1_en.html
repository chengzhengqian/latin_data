<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">XVII.—Exuperius of Toulouse, the Rhetorician</span></span></h2>
<p>Now must I renew your memory, Exuperius, an orator without help of rules, solemn of gait, majestic in speech, handsome in features and, in a word, admirable in gesture and deportment. Your eloquence was matchless in its fluency, and if judged only by the ear, would please through mere force of sound, but if closely examined would be found to contain no solid thought.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_124_1" id="target_note_LCL096_124_1"><sup>1</sup></a> At first the councillors of Toulouse, that home of Pallas, received you with adoration, but soon drove you as lightly away. Then Narbo harboured you: there, taking a high fee for your teaching, you trained in rhetoric the sons of Dalmatius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL096_125_2" id="target_note_LCL096_125_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—royal but tragic names—from boyhood up to the beginning of manhood. When in due time they assumed the title of Caesar, they bestowed upon you the dignity of a governorship and a tribunal in Spain. Passing away, exceeding rich, you brought your unruffled nature and your peaceful years to a close in your abode at Cadurca (Cahors). But your country’s claims and the birthplace of your family summon you to bequeath your title of rhetorician to Bordeaux.</p>
