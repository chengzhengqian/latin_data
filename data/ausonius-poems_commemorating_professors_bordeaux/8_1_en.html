<h2><span class="ac"><span class="sc">VII.—Leontius the Grammarian, Surnamed Lascivus</span></span></h2>
<p>Y<span class="sc">ou</span> who love a glad and cheerful soul, you who observe festal days with their jests, their prayers, their shows, forget not to recall year by year the name of Leontius with a dirge. Enduring to be called Lascivus (Wanton), though the name was a libel on his upright life, he never forbade its use, because he knew it amused his friends’ ears. In letters he had attained a high enough degree to qualify him for his humble chair, and to give him some claim to be enrolled as a grammarian.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span><p>You were the constant companion of my youth, although you bare a heavier load of years, and still to-day you have a warm place in my heart, kindly Leontius. I take sad pleasure in the task of honouring your memory with the mournful strain of this complaint: it is a task unpleasing, but one that my verse owes to you.</p>
