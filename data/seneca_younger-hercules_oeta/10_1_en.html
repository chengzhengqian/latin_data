<p class="noindent">What a bloodthirsty rage there is that goads women when a single house is opened to a mistress as well as a wife! Scylla and Charybdis, churning the Sicilian strait, are not more fearsome, no wild beast is worse. When the captive mistress’ beauty shone forth—Iole shimmering like the gleam of unclouded daylight or a bright star in the clear night—Hercules’ wife stood like a madwoman, glaring grimly. She resembled a whelped tigress, lying beneath a crag in Armenia, that leaps up at sight of the foe; or a Maenad, called to brandish the thyrsus, quickened and ridden by Lyaeus, unsure where to direct her steps. She hesitated briefly; then she rushed in frenzy through Hercules’ house, the whole building scarcely giving room enough; she charged forward, swerved, stopped. All her pain came into her face, almost nothing was left hidden in her breast. Tears followed hard on threats. No single attitude lasted long, no single expression of rage satisfied her: now her cheeks flamed, now pallor expelled the color. Her pain ranged through every possible form, she lamented, entreated, groaned.</p>
