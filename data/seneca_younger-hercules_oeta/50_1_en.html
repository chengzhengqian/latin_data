 death! Alcides dies—at whose hands! If the unyielding fates wished me to fall by a woman’s hand, if my death ran on such an ignominious thread, I could have fallen (what torment!) to Juno’s hatred; my fall would have come through the onslaught of a female, but one who holds heaven. If that was too much for the gods, an Amazon born beneath the Scythian sky could have tamed my strength. But what a woman it is whose hand defeats <span class="italic">me</span>, the opponent of Juno! Yet the shame of this is more grievous for you, stepmother! Why do you call this a happy day? Did earth produce anything comparable to serve your anger? A mortal woman has surpassed your hatred. You were still enraged at being unequal to Alcides: now you are bested by two. The gods should be ashamed of their anger!</p>
<p>If only the Nemean scourge had sated its gaping jaws on my blood, or I had fed the hydra with my gore, walled in by its hundred snakes! If only I had been given to Centaurs as pillage, or were seated among the shades, bound pitifully fast to eternal rock!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_441_73" id="target_note_LCL078_441_73"><sup>73</sup></a> As it is, I dragged forth the remotest spoil (to Fate’s amazement), reached the daylight once more from infernal Styx, won past the barriers of Dis, everywhere death has fled from me—so I should lack the distinction of a glorious death. Ah, those wild beasts, the beasts I conquered! The triform hound could not take me back to the Styx when he glimpsed the sun; under western skies the savage herdsman’s Spanish throng<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_441_74" id="target_note_LCL078_441_74"><sup>74</sup></a> could not defeat me, nor could the twin serpents.
