my womb as an infant!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_491_106" id="target_note_LCL078_491_106"><sup>106</sup></a> But as it is, time was granted me, granted to see my son vying with Jove in glory—so that this too could be granted, to know what fate could steal from me.</p>
<p>What nation still remembers its debt to you, my son? The whole race is already lacking in gratitude. Shall I make for Cleonae? Or make for the communities of Arcadia, seek out the land made famous by your beneficial deeds? Here the monstrous serpent fell, here the fierce birds, here the bloodied boar; here your hands crushed the lion that now occupies heaven while you are buried below.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_491_107" id="target_note_LCL078_491_107"><sup>107</sup></a> If the land is grateful, all its people should protect your Alcmene. Shall I make for the tribes of Thrace, the peoples of the Hebrus? This land too was defended by your worthy deeds; the stables lie overthrown with the ruler.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_491_108" id="target_note_LCL078_491_108"><sup>108</sup></a> Here peace was bestowed by the downfall of the bloodstained king—indeed, when was it ever withheld?</p>
<p>What tomb shall an ill-starred old woman try to find for you? The whole world should compete for your ashes. What nation, what temples, what tribes desire the remains of great Hercules? Who asks for, who demands Alcmene’s burden?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_491_109" id="target_note_LCL078_491_109"><sup>109</sup></a> What tomb, my son, what burial mound is sufficient for you? This whole world! And fame will be your epitaph.</p>
