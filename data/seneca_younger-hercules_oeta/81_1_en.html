<span class="line indent2">fearing for his realm, scared for himself?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Surely with these very eyes I saw you</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">laid on the blazing timber, as fiery</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">terror raged powerfully toward the heavens;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">surely you burned there: why could the final</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

Refrain now from lamenting, mother: it was only once that I saw the shades and ghosts. All that was yours and mortal in me has been mastered and taken by the fire; my fatherâ€™s part has been assigned to heaven, your part to the flames. So put aside mourning, such as a mother would undertake for a lackluster son; grief should be spent on the ignoble; valor heads to the stars, cowardice to death. Coming from the stars in very presence, mother, I Alcides prophesy: the bloodthirsty Eurystheus will soon be punished to your satisfaction; you will ride in triumph above his proud head. Now I must ascend to the heavenly regions. Alcides has once more conquered the underworld.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">alcmene</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Stay a little while! He has vanished from my sight, left me, set out for the stars. Am I deceived, or do my eyes reckon they saw my son? My poor mind cannot believe it. You <span class="italic">are</span> a god, the heavens hold you forever. I believe in your triumph. I shall make for the kingdom of Thebes, and proclaim this new god that joins their temples.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
