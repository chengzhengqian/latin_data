All that was once desirable in me is diminished; sisterhood<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_373_32" id="target_note_LCL078_373_32"><sup>32</sup></a> and motherhood both stole much of it from me, and much will be stolen by quickly advancing age. But you see how this slave has not lost her high grace. She is completely without adornment, covered in grime, yet her loveliness shines through her very troubles; chance and harsh fate have taken nothing from her except her realm. This is the fear that besets my heart, nurse, this is the dread that robs me of sleep. I used to be famed as a wife among all nations; every young woman that asked intensely for anything from any gods would long for my marriage with envy in her prayers; for Argive women’s prayers, I was the standard!
