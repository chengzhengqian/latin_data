A wool cloth, used to impregnate the robe and smear the clothes, had been thrown aside full in the bright, burning sunlight. It shuddered, and as its pile was heated by Phoebus it burst into flames—I can scarcely speak of something so monstrous! As the east wind or warm south wind melts the snows that vanish in early spring on bright Mimas, and as the spent swell foams right on the shore when waves rolling in from the Ionian Sea break against the barrier of Leucas, or as incense strewn to the gods melts in altar fires, so the whole cloth wilted and lost its pile. And while I wondered at it, the cause of my wonder was destroyed. Indeed the very ground heaved and foamed; anything touched by that gore languished, and swelling with the stealthy &lt;bane&gt; . . .</p>
