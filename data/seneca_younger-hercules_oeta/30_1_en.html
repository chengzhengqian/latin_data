As a sea churned up by the south wind continues to heave though the weather grows calm and the winds drop, so my mind is still agitated though the fear is shaken off. Assuredly when god once begins to attack the fortunate, he harries them. This is how greatness ends.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">chorus leader</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">What is this violent whirlwind of mischance, poor woman?</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL078_401_53a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL078_401_53a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">53</sup>The last lines are vigorously rendered by John Studley in his translation of the play (published 1566): “Let other mount aloft, let other soar, / As happy man in great estate to sit. / By  flattering name of Lord I set no store; / For under shore my little keel should flit, / And from rough winds my sails fain would I keep, / Lest I be driven into the dangerous deep. / Proud Fortune’s rage doth never stoop so low / As little roads, but them she overflies / And seeks amid main seas her force to show / On argosies, whose tops do reach the skies.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL078_401_53a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
