<span class="line indent3">While flowers appear in springtime’s warmth</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and summer calls back forest leaves</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and apples fall as autumn wanes</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and winter pares back forest leaves,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">you will be there with the stars and Phoebus.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Time will never efface you on earth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Crops will sooner sprout on the deep</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">or seas resound with freshwater waves,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sooner the stars of the icy Bear</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">will descend and enjoy the forbidden waters,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent3">Father of the world, in distress we pray:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">we crave a champion for the friendless earth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p><p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line indent2">What’s this? A mighty sound through the world!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The father mourning Alcides? Or cries</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">from the gods? Or the voice of the frightened stepmother—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">has Juno seen Hercules and fled from the stars?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Or Atlas staggering under his weight?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Or rather the dread shades trembling in terror</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and the underworld hound breaking his chains</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
