you of Hercules! This very hand killed the father through whom you have the Thunderer as grandfather. I have robbed you of a greater glory than I gave you by birth. If villainy is unknown to you, learn it from your mother. Whether you decide to plunge your sword in my throat, or wish to assault your mother’s womb, your mother will offer you unshrinking courage. Such a terrible crime will not be done wholly by you: it will be your hand that strikes me down, but my will. Alcides’ son afraid? So will you not carry out orders or crush evils after your father’s style? Prepare your hand fearlessly!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_427_66" id="target_note_LCL078_427_66"><sup>66</sup></a> See, my sorrowful breast is open: strike!</p>
<p>I release you from the crime, the Eumenides themselves are going to spare your right hand. There is the sound of their cracking whips! Who is this whose hair writhes with quivering snakes, who flails the black wings at her fetid temples? Why do you pursue me with that blazing torch, dread Megaera? Demanding retribution for Alcides? I shall pay it. Are the underworld’s judges already seated, goddess? But look, I see the prison doors open. Who is that man, now old, carrying a huge rock on his grazed shoulders? See, though mastered the boulder is already trying to roll back. Who surrenders his body to the wheel?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_427_67" id="target_note_LCL078_427_67"><sup>67</sup></a> See here, dread Tisiphone stands white-faced
