fates, by which history will say I was conquered? Lichas has conquered Hercules? See, another defeat: Hercules slays Lichas! My deeds must be sullied, and this must be my final labor.” Hurled toward the stars, he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_411_56" id="target_note_LCL078_411_56"><sup>56</sup></a> spattered the clouds with a spray of blood. So a shaft leaps skyward when released on command by a Getic hand, or shot by a Cydonian—yet even arrows would fly lower. His body fell into the sea, his head onto rocks: a single corpse lying in both elements.</p>
<p>“Wait!” he said to us. “My mind is not seized with madness, this evil is deeper than madness or wrath: <span class="italic">I</span> am the target of my rage!” Scarcely had he described his affliction when he vented his rage. He rent his own body, plucked and tore at his limbs with his mighty hands. He was trying to take off the garment—the one task in which I have seen Hercules fail. But in trying to tear it off, he tore his limbs too: the robe was part of his rugged body, the garment merged with the skin. The cause of the terrible havoc was not clear to all, yet this was the cause. Scarcely able to endure the pain, now he fell facedown on the ground in weakness, now demanded water—but water did not master the pain. He made for the wave-loud shore and plunged into the sea; the band of servants restrained him as he lurched about. Cruel fate!—we were Alcides’ equals.</p>
<p>Now a ship is bringing him back from the shore of Euboea, with a light south wind speeding Hercules’ bulky body. His spirit is forsaking his limbs, night pressing on his eyes.</p>
