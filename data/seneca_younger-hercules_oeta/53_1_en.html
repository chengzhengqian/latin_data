evils, and none! What do you look like? At least allow me to know what evil is killing me! Whatever scourge, whatever beast you are, be feared in the open! Who made you a place in the very marrow of my bones? See, my hand tore away the skin and uncovered my guts—yet you found some remoter hiding place. Oh evil resembling Hercules!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_447_77" id="target_note_LCL078_447_77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p>But why this weeping? Why tears on these cheeks? This face, once invincible and never given to bestowing tears on its troubles, has now learned—shame on me!—to weep. What day, what land has seen Hercules in tears? I bore my hardships dry-eyed. To you that valor that crushed so many evils has yielded—to you alone.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_447_78" id="target_note_LCL078_447_78"><sup>78</sup></a> You first, and in front of all, have wrested tears from me. This face, harder than rugged rock or steel or the shifting Symplegades, has been overcome, abated its threats and forced out tears. By the high ruler of heaven! The earth has seen me weeping and groaning, and what torments me more, my stepmother has seen it. Ah! The heat has intensified and burns my tissues again. Where is the thunderbolt to strike me?</p>
