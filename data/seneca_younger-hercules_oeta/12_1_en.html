<p class="noindent">Shall Iole the captive produce brothers for my sons? Shall a slave become daughter-in-law to Jove? Can it be that fire and torrent will take the same course, or the dry Bear drink of the deep-blue sea? I shall not go unavenged. Though you have borne the heavens and the whole world owes its peace to you, there is something worse than a hydra: the pain of an angry wife. Does any fire as great as that rage toward heaven from burning Etna? Anything you have conquered, this spirit will conquer. Is a mistress to steal my marriage bed? I was still fearing monsters, but now such evils are no more, scourges have vanished, and in place of a beast has come this hateful mistress.</p>
<p>In the name of the gods’ high ruler and the bright Titan! I was Hercules’ wife only in his danger, the vows I offered the gods worked for the captive, I was successful for the mistress; for her you gods heard my prayers, for her he returns unscathed. O pain that no vengeance can satisfy, look for horrible, unthought-of, unspeakable punishments! Teach Juno the power of hate: she is incapable of sufficient anger.</p>
<p>You used to wage war for me; it was on my account that Achelous stained his meandering stream with his blood, when he turned into a lithe serpent, then dropped the serpent and changed his menace to that of a grim bull: you conquered a thousand beasts in one enemy! Now I no longer please you; a captive is preferred to me. But she shall not be preferred: the last day of our marriage will be the last of your life.</p>
