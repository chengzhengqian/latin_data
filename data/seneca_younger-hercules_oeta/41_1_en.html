<p>But you who rack the realm of the dark world, prepare me some suffering. This mistake will surpass the crimes dared by anyone; even Juno did not dare rob the world of Hercules. So prepare some fearful punishment. Let Sisyphus’ neck rest, and his stone push down on my shoulders. Let the inconstant water flee, the fraudulent stream delude my thirst.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_423_63" id="target_note_LCL078_423_63"><sup>63</sup></a> I deserve to surrender my hands to the spinning of the wheel that racks the Thessalian king. Let a greedy vulture on each side root out my guts. One Danaid is missing: I shall fill her role. Make room, you shades, in whatever place encloses guilty women. Take me as your companion, wife from Phasis: this hand is worse than either of your crimes, whether as guilty mother or monstrous sister.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_423_64" id="target_note_LCL078_423_64"><sup>64</sup></a> Let me accompany your crimes, Thracian wife. Receive your daughter, mother Althaea, and recognize your true child now. Yet did your hands destroy anything as great?</p>
<p>Bar Elysium to me, you loyal wives who dwell in the groves of the sacred wood. But each wife that stained her hands with her husband’s blood, dismissed chaste love and stood with drawn sword as a bloodstained Beliad, should recognize and praise her own hands in mine. I want to join this group of wives—but even that group will shun such monstrous hands.</p>
