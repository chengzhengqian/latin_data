beyond doubt for Hercules’ conception, or whether my father is mortal. My pedigree may be false, an end may be put to my mother’s shame and Jove’s discredit,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_467_91" id="target_note_LCL078_467_91"><sup>91</sup></a> yet I have come to deserve his parentage. I have brought heaven renown, nature conceived me for Jove’s greater glory. Even he, though almighty, is glad to be thought my father. Stop your tears now, mother: you will be proud among the mothers of Greece. Has Juno, wife of the Thunderer and wielder of the heavenly scepter, given birth to anything comparable? Ruling the heavens, she still envied a mortal, and wished Alcides was called her own.</p>
<p>Now you are left, Titan, to carry out your rounds alone; I, who accompanied you everywhere, am making for the shades of Tartarus. Yet I shall bear this glorious renown into the depths, that no scourge openly slew Alcides, and every scourge was openly defeated by Alcides.
