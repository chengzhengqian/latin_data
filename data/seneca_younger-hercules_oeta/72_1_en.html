brands resisted and avoided his limbs, but Hercules pursued the fire when it retreated. You would have thought it was the Caucasus or Pindus or Athos that was blazing. No sound burst from him, only the fire groaned. O tough heart! If placed on that pyre, even monstrous Typhon would have groaned, or the one who tore Ossa from the earth and set it on his shoulders, ferocious Enceladus.</p>

He strengthened the courage of all his attendants: you would think him burning while being burned!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_485_99" id="target_note_LCL078_485_99"><sup>99</sup></a> The whole crowd stood in amazement, and the flames were scarcely thought real, so calm was his brow, so great the hero’s majesty. He did not hasten the burning, but when he judged that the demands of a courageous death had been fulfilled, he dragged together the fiery beams: the ones least caught by the flames he moved fully into the fire, and then, fierce and unafraid, gathered those from which the fire poured most strongly. Then he thrust his face full into the flames. His heavy beard blazed up; but as the menacing fire attacked his face and the flames licked around his head, he did not close his eyes.</p>
