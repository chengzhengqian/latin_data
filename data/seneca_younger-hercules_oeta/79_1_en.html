<span class="line indent3">You too, you host of the whirling heavens,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">must weep for the fall of Hercules:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">your celestial world, you gods on high,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">was borne on the neck of my Alcides,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">when the usual bearer of starry Olympus,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Atlas, breathed easy, freed of his burden.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Where are your lofty heights now, Jove?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Where is the promised palace in heaven?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Clearly Alcides is dead and buried,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">clearly a mortal.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">And yet, whenever you would have needed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to shower fire,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">he saved you from using your lightning bolts.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Hurl the lightning at me, at least,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and think me Semele!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Have you reached Elysium, my son,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">have you reached the shore</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to which whole throngs are summoned by Nature?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Or has the black Styx barred your way</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">since you stole the houndâ€”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">do the Fates detain you</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">at the outer threshold of the realm of Dis?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">What kind of commotion grips the shades</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">now, my son?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Has the oarsman taken his boat and fled?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Are the Centaurs of Thessaly bolting away,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">trampling the panicked shades with their hooves?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Has the hydra plunged its snaky heads</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">underwater in fright?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Are your labors in fear of you, my son?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
