If the wandering Symplegades crushed me between their two crags, I would endure the menace of their returning onslaught. Pindus could bear down on me, and Haemus, and Athos that breaks the waves of Thrace, and Mimas that receives Jove’s thunderbolts. Not even if the very heavens should fall upon me, mother, and Phoebus’ burning chariot blaze above my couch, would unworthy cries master the spirit of Hercules. Let a thousand beasts together run at me and rend me; let the airborne Stymphalians strike me on this side with their wild cries, and on that side a menacing bull with all the force of his neck—and whatever was prodigious just in itself. On each side let trees spring up, and dread Sinis shoot my limbs skyward; though torn apart, I shall remain silent. No beasts, no weapons, nothing <span class="italic">assailable</span> will draw groans from me.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">alcmene</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">It is no woman’s poison, my son, that scorches your body, but the arduous round of labors and lengthy toil has perhaps bred bloody diseases in you.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">hercules</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent"><span class="italic">Where</span> is disease, where in the world?
