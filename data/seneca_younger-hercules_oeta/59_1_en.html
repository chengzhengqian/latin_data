<p class="noindent">Alas, even his senses have been overthrown and driven out by excessive pain. Pain causes this madness; it alone can master Hercules. (<span class="italic">to</span> <span class="italic">attendants</span>) Please remove his weapons, quickly carry those menacing arrows away from here, I pray you: his blazing eyes threaten some crime. What refuge shall an old woman look for? But then, why look for refuge or escape? Folly! Alcmene deserves to die by a valiant hand. Let her even perish by crime, before some coward assigns me death, or some dishonorable hand triumphs over me.</p>
<p>But see, the exhaustion of suffering and pain is binding his weary frame in sleep; his chest heaves and shakes in a labored rhythm. Show him favor, you gods! If you have denied me my famous son to my sorrow, at least save the world its champion, I pray. Let his pain be driven away, and the body of Hercules regain strength anew.</p>

The Thunderer’s daughter-in-law is dead, and his son laid low, while I his grandson survive; <span class="italic">he</span> is dying through my mother’s crime, <span class="italic">she</span> was taken in by deceit. What old man could tell of such sorrows through the passing years, through the whole of his life? One day has stolen both my parents. To say nothing of my other troubles, and not to reproach the fates, I am losing Hercules as my father.</p></div><notes></notes></section>
