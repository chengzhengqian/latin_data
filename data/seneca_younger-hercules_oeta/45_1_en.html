<span class="line indent2">forgetting to chase in flight</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the waters lost their headway;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and as the rivers tarried</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the Getae, far into Bistonia,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">thought the Hebrus had failed.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The woodland brought winged creatures,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">perched in the trees they came;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">but those flying in the open</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">veered at the sound of his songs</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">with faltering wings, and fell.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Athos tore its crags free,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">carrying Centaurs along,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and stopped near Rhodope,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">its snows melted by song.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Dryads escaped from their oaks</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and hurried to hear the bard.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Wild beasts came to your songs</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">with their very hiding places;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">close to unterrified cattle</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sat the Marmaric lion;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">deer were not panicked by wolves,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and serpents abandoned their lairs,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">for once forgetting their venom.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">He even approached the silent</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">shades through Taenarusâ€™ gates,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">plucking his mournful lyre.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">With his tearful song he vanquished</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Tartarus and the somber gods</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of Erebus, and braved the pools</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of Styx, the oath of heaven.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The restless wheel stayed put,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">inert, its spinning quelled;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
