Let the world lose this day of my death, let heaven be roiled with black clouds: block my stepmother’s view! Now, father, blind chaos should be restored; both poles should be smashed, the firmament shattered from end to end. Why spare the stars? You are losing Hercules, father. Now, Jupiter, look to every quarter of heaven, lest some Gyges hurl Thessalian peaks, and Othrys prove a light weight for Enceladus. Proud Pluto will shortly open the doors of his black prison, strike off his father’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_437_70" id="target_note_LCL078_437_70"><sup>70</sup></a> chains and restore him to heaven. I, the one born on earth in lieu of your fiery thunderbolt, am returning to the Styx. Fierce Enceladus will arise and hurl at the gods the burden that now oppresses him. My death, father, will put the entire realm of the sky at risk for you. Before you are completely despoiled of the heavens, hide me, father, in the utter ruin of the cosmos, smash the sky that you are losing.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL078_437_70"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL078_437_70" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">70</sup>Saturn.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL078_437_70').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
