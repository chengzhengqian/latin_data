<p class="noindent">Lichas, name of constant loyalty to your rulers—something proud houses never possess: take this garment, spun by my hands while he was wandering the earth, while he clasped the young Lydian woman in his fierce embrace when worse for wine, and while he demanded Iole. But perhaps I can change his violent passion by serving him; service can prevail on the unkind. Before my husband puts the garment on, bid him feed incense into the fire and propitiate the gods, his stiff hair circled with gray poplar leaves.</p>
<p>I myself shall go inside the royal house, and make prayers to the mother of ferocious Love. You Calydonian women, whom I brought as friends from my father’s hearth: lament this grievous situation.</p>
