<span class="line indent2">Impervious his limbs to any wound.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">He senses iron as dull, steel is too soft;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">a sword is shattered on his unarmed body,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">a rock rebounds. He scorns the power of fate</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and challenges death with his unconquered breast.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">He never could be pierced by sharpened spears</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">nor Scythian shafts discharged from tautened bows</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">nor arrows that the chill Sarmatian bears</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">or Parthians, set beneath the zone of dawn,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">who train wounds on their Nabataean neighbors</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and strike more surely than any Cretan archer.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">His body’s thrust pushed down Oechalia’s walls;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">nothing could stand in his way. What he planned to conquer</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">was as good as conquered—How few fell to his wounds!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">His angry visage carried a power like death;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to have seen the threatening Hercules was enough.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">What giant Briareus or swollen Gyges,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">standing on mountains piled in Thessaly</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and reaching snaky hands toward the sky,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">glared so ferociously? Yet from great disasters</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">great gains emerge: no further evil remains,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">we have seen the anger of Hercules to our sorrow.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">iole</span></span><p class="lineGroup"><span class="line indent2">But my sad theme</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">is not temples fallen on their gods</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">or hearths demolished,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the burning of fathers together with sons,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">gods with men, temples with tombs:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
