<span class="line indent2">Why do <span class="italic">my</span> arms</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">not yet transform to feathered wings?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Happy, happy</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">shall I be when the woodland is called my home,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and alighting as a bird in my native fields</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">I recount my ruin in plaintive tones,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and fame shall speak of winged Iole.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">I saw, I saw</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the pitiful fate my father met:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">struck by that death-bearing club</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">his body lay spattered throughout the hall.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Ah, if fate had granted you burial</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">how repeated the search would have been for you, father!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Could I bear to watch <span class="italic">your</span> butchery,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">your cheeks still tender, not yet bearded,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and your heart blood not yet valiant, Toxeus?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">But why lament my family’s fate,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">when kindly death has borne them to safety?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">My own fortune calls for tears from me.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Soon as a captive I shall spin the distaff</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and spindle for my mistress.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Ah, cruel beauty,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">lovely form that will bring forth death for me:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">for you alone my whole house fell</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">as my father refused me to Alcides,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">afraid to be Hercules’ kin by marriage.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">But now I must make for my lady’s house.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">chorus</span></span><p class="lineGroup"><span class="line indent2">Why look back on your ancestry</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
