<p class="noindent">Why hesitant, why stunned, my spirit? The crime is done! Jove demands back his son, Juno her antagonist; &lt;that great defender of cities and conqueror of evil&gt; ought to be given back to the world. But provide what <span class="italic">can</span> be given back.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_413_57" id="target_note_LCL078_413_57"><sup>57</sup></a> The sword must be thrust through my body—yes, this is what must be done. But can so slight a hand lay claim to such weighty restitution? Use your thunderbolts, father-in-law, to destroy your criminal daughter-in-law! And do not arm your hand with a light weapon: the bolt leaping from the sky must be the one you would have used—if Alcides had not been born to you—to incinerate the hydra. Strike me like some unexampled scourge, like an evil worse than the angry stepmother.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_413_58" id="target_note_LCL078_413_58"><sup>58</sup></a> Launch a weapon like that launched once against the straying Phaethon: I too have ruined nations,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_413_59" id="target_note_LCL078_413_59"><sup>59</sup></a> by robbing them of Hercules.</p>
<p>Why ask the gods for a weapon? Give your father-in-law some respite! Alcides’ wife should be ashamed to <span class="italic">pray</span> for death. My prayer must be to myself, this hand will serve it. Quick, seize a sword. But then, why a sword? Anything that leads to death is ample as a weapon. I shall leap from a soaring crag. My choice shall be this very Oeta, which first claims the reborn daylight: yes, I shall fling my body from here. Yet a single death is light punishment—light, but it can be prolonged: let the steep cliff rend me and every rock take part of me, let my broken hands hang there, and the whole jagged flank of the mountain be encrimsoned.</p>
