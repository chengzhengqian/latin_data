<p>O my spirit, you are inept in choosing a weapon to fall on! I wish, I wish there was a sword of Hercules’ lodged in my bedchamber; that would be a fitting blade for me to die upon. But is it enough for me to be killed by a single hand? Gather, you nations! The whole world must hurl rocks and firebrands without number, no hand must be idle now; seize your weapons! I have stolen your defender. Now cruel kings will wield their scepters in safety, now some invincible scourge will be born in safety. Altars will be restored that regularly see victims resembling the worshippers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL078_415_60" id="target_note_LCL078_415_60"><sup>60</sup></a> I have made a path for crimes; I have exposed you all to tyrants, kings, monsters, wild animals, and cruel gods by removing your defender. Are you slow to act, partner of the Thunderer? Not showering fire in your brother’s style, stealing it from Jove, hurling it and destroying me yourself? Glorious renown, a huge triumph has been stolen from you: I have outstripped you, Juno, in killing your antagonist.</p>
