waste? Did our allies ever suffer or expect in war anything
worse than they experienced in peace when this man
was governor of Inner Africa? He drained the province of
all that could be transferred in bonds or thrust aboard
ships. Yes, Conscript Fathers, he scooped up as much as he
wanted. To avoid prosecution he struck a bargain with
Caesar: 1,200,000 sesterces. If any of this is false, refute it
in front of these gentlemen: state the source from which
you, who could not even pay off the mortgage on your father’s
house, suddenly rich as in a dream acquired a very
valuable suburban estate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_389_20" id="target_note_LCL462_389_20"><sup>20</sup></a> Caesar’s villa at Tibur,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_389_21" id="target_note_LCL462_389_21"><sup>21</sup></a> and
the rest of your properties. And you, owner of a villa that
had recently been Caesar’s, did not scruple to ask why I

you suddenly become so affluent, so rich? Nobody would
have left you his money, for nobody thinks you respectable

raise you high! Whether you resemble them or they resembled
you, all of them were criminals or good-for-nothings
of the very worst description. But I suppose it’s your offices
that make you insolent! Gaius Sallustius, do you think that
being twice a Senator and twice a Quaestor is the same as
having two Consulships and two Triumphs? Anyone who
sets about to denounce another person should be beyond
reproach. Only someone who cannot be reviled truthfully
reviles. But you! A hanger-on at every dinner table, a fancy
