boy in every bedroom when you were young and an adulterer
later on, you are a disgrace to every order and a reminder
of the Civil War. What worse could we undergo
than to see you as a citizen in this order? Give it up: the
truculent attacks on good men, the indulgence in your
pathological insolence, the judging of others by your own
character—give it up! You can’t make a friend by such behaviour.
You seem to want to have an enemy.</p>
<p>I shall bring my words to a close, Conscript Fathers.
For I have often seen that those who speak candidly of
the enormities of others offend the ears of their audience
more gravely than those who perpetrate the same. I have
to put my mind not to what Sallustius deserves to hear but
to saying what can properly be said by me.</p>
