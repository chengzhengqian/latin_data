charge against Sallustius but recognize all the old items
with which my ears and yours and his own are already
buzzing. But you ought to be all the more disgusted with
him; he did not make even his debut as a wrongdoer in
trifling concerns but launched out in such a style that for all
the rest of his life he could neither be outdone by someone
else nor surpass himself.</p>
<p>So his one endeavour is to wallow like a muddy pig with
somebody, no matter whom. But he is much mistaken.
Stains of life are not washed away by an impudent tongue.
But there is a verdict of false accusation which each one of
us incurs on the testimony of his own conscience with reference
to a false charge that he has brought against good
men.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_375_2a" id="target_note_LCL462_375_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> But if this man’s life overtaxes memory, it will be for
you to look at it not from words but from his general conduct.
<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_375_3" id="target_note_LCL462_375_3"><sup>3</sup></a> I shall take care to be as brief as I can. And this
exchange of ours will not be without advantage to you,
Conscript Fathers. The public generally finds its account
in private feuds, in which no citizen can hide from revealing
what sort of man he is.</p>
<p>First of all then, since C. Sallustius seeks everybody’s
ancestors according to one pattern and standard, I should
like his answer to a question: did those Scipios and Metelli
whom he has brought up have any reputation or glory
