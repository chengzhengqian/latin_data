<p>After that selection of the Senate we saw no more of
you—unless perhaps<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_387_17" id="target_note_LCL462_387_17"><sup>17</sup></a> you flung yourself into that army
into which all the bilge water of the commonwealth had
flowed. But that same Sallustius who in peacetime had not
even kept his place as a Senator, that same was brought
back into the Senate by way of a Quaestorship<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_387_18" id="target_note_LCL462_387_18"><sup>18</sup></a> after the
commonwealth had been crushed by arms, by a conqueror
who restored exiles. He so functioned in that office that
there was nothing for which there was a buyer that he did
not have for sale. He exploited it on the principle that
nothing he wanted to do was other than fair and right. He

into a single quagmire. Every rake, every pervert, every
murderer, every sacrilege-monger, every debtor in Rome
and the municipalities and the colonies and all Italy had

men,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_387_19" id="target_note_LCL462_387_19"><sup>19</sup></a> in no way fitted for soldiering except in the
license of their vices and their eagerness for revolution.</p>
<p>Ah, but after he was elected Praetor he behaved with
temperance and self-restraint. Did he not lay his province
