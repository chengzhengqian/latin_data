and asked me, or that I checked Sestius’ insolence,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_383_10" id="target_note_LCL462_383_10"><sup>10</sup></a>
or blamed Bibulus’ doggedness,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_383_11" id="target_note_LCL462_383_11"><sup>11</sup></a> or backed Caesar’s
achievements—I praised an outstanding citizen, and once
only.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_383_12" id="target_note_LCL462_383_12"><sup>12</sup></a> If you bring that against me as a fault, your rashness
will be blamed, not my shortcomings. I should say more if I
had to hold forth before others, Conscript Fathers, and
not before you, who have been the monitors of my every
course of action. But where the facts are my witnesses,
what need of words?</p>
<p>To turn now to yourself, Sallustius, let me pass over
your father. If he never did anything wrong in his life, all
the same he could have done no greater harm to the commonwealth
than by begetting a son like you. And I shall not
pursue any wrongdoings in your boyhood since I don’t
want to seem to accuse your father, who had complete
power over you at that time. I shall speak of your early
manhood, for when I have made that clear it will be easily
understood how way ward was the boyhood which developed
so immoral and outrageous a young man. After the
earnings of your shameless body could no longer satisfy
your limitless appetite and you had passed the age for submitting
to whatever it pleased the other party to do, you
were carried away by unbounded lusts in your desire to try
upon others things that you yourself had not felt as degrading
to your own person. So it is difficult to compute, Conscript
Fathers, which of his bodily parts were the more
indecent, those by which he made money<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_383_13" id="target_note_LCL462_383_13"><sup>13</sup></a> or those by
which he lost it. He put his father’s house up for sale while
his father was still alive, a shocking act; and can anybody
doubt that he brought about his death, seeing that before
his father died he behaved in all respects as an inheritor?
And he is not ashamed to ask who lives in P. Crassus’ house
