think you were far off the mark when you thought to create
ill will against me by talking about my means, which are far
less than I deserve. And I only wish they were not as large
as they are, with my friends alive rather than me richer by
their wills.</p>
<p>A runaway? I, Gaius Sallustius? I gave way before the
frenzy of a Tribune.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_381_8" id="target_note_LCL462_381_8"><sup>8</sup></a> I deemed it more expedient to take
whatever fortune came to me individually than to be the
cause of civil strife to the People of Rome universally.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL462_381_9" id="target_note_LCL462_381_9"><sup>9</sup></a>
After he had whirled through his year in public life and
everything he had stirred up settled down in peace and
tranquillity, this order recalled me and the hand of the
commonwealth itself drew me back: I returned. If that day
were compared to all the rest of my life, it would turn the
scale, at least in my mind: the day when all of you and the
Roman People in large numbers hailed my arrival. That
was how highly they thought of me, the runaway, the mercenary
advocate! Nor is it surprising, upon my word, if I
always valued all friendships aright. I did not become any
individual’s private lackey or bind myself over, but in so far
as each man was loyal or hostile to the commonwealth, to
that extent I was his friend or his adversary. I wanted nothing
to count for more than peace; many others encouraged
the audacity of private individuals. I feared nothing but
the law; many others wanted their own arms to be feared. I
never wanted any power except in your interests; many
others in reliance on the power they had from you abused
their strength against you. So it is not surprising if I
had friendship with nobody who was not consistently a
friend to the commonwealth. And I don’t regret that I
promised to defend Vatinius when he was under prosecution
