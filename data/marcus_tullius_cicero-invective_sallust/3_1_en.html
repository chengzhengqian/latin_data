before their own performances and blameless lives commended

and prestige, why should the same standard not be applied
to myself, seeing that my performances are celebrated
and my life passed without reproach? As though you, Sallustius,
were a descendant of theirs! If you had been, some
would now be sorry for your turpitude. As for me, I have
outshone my forebears by my achievement, so that if previously
unknown they begin to be remembered owing to
me. You, on the other hand, have cast deep shadows on
yours by your disgraceful life, so that even if they were outstanding
citizens they have passed into oblivion because of
you. So don’t throw men of old in my face. Better that I win
distinction through my own performances than rely on the
reputation of my forebears, and live so as to start nobility
for those who come after me and be a shining example.
Furthermore, it is not fitting, Conscript Fathers, that I be
compared with men who have passed away and are now
beyond all hate and envy; the comparison should be with
my fellow actors on the political stage. But suppose I was
too competitive in seeking office—and I don’t mean competition
for popular approval, in which I admit I have
taken the lead, but the deleterious, law-breaking kind in
which Sallustius led the front ranks: who has been so diligent
in the conduct of magistracies, or so strict in punishing
wrongdoings, or so vigilant in protecting the commonwealth?
You call it a proscription, because, I suppose, not
everybody of your ilk lived on in our city unscathed; but in
how much better shape the commonwealth would stand if

the writer’s addled head confuses them with the Scipio or Metellus who originally brought distinction into his family by his own
merits—a familiar point; cf. e.g. <span class="italic">Letters to Friends</span> 71 (III.7).5.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL462_377_4a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
