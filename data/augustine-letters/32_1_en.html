vain; yea, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ; whom He raised not up”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_65_a" id="target_note_LCL239_65_a"><sup>a</sup></a>? If anyone should say to him: “What is it in this lie that shocks you, when, even if what you say is untrue, it very greatly redounds to the glory of God?” would he not denounce the madness of such a suggestion and with every available word and sign open to the light the inmost secrets of his heart, declaring that to praise falsehood in God was no less a sin, perhaps even a much greater one, than to cast aspersion upon His truth? An effort must be made to bring to a knowledge of the sacred Scriptures a man who will have such a reverent and truthful opinion of the holy books that he would refuse to find delight in a well-meant falsehood anywhere in them, and would rather pass over what he does not understand than prefer his own intelligence to their truth. For indeed when he expresses such a preference, he demands credence for himself and attempts to destroy our confidence in the authority of the holy Scriptures.</p>
<p>For my part I would use all the strength the Lord<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> supplies to show that all those texts that are adduced to prove the expediency of falsehood ought to be understood in another sense, so that everywhere their unimpeachable veracity might be made apparent. For just as texts ought not to be lies in themselves, so they should lend no support to lies. But I leave this matter to your own intelligence; if you apply a more attentive consideration to the reading of them, you will perhaps see this more easily than I do. To that consideration you will be compelled by the reverent spirit that makes you recognize that the authority of the holy Scriptures becomes unsettled,
