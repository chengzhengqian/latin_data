<p>You will have already heard, I am sure, of the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> death of the Senior Megalius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_107_a" id="target_note_LCL239_107_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; as I write, it is almost twenty-four days since his body was laid to rest. Let me know, if possible, whether you have seen his successor in the primacy, as was your intention.
