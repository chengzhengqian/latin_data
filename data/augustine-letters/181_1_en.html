<p>There are on record among the judgements given<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> by the Apostolic See itself, or its confirmations of the judgements of others, precedents for not depriving certain bishops, tried for certain offences, of their episcopal rank, and yet for not leaving them altogether unpunished. Not to seek out examples that are far from our own day, I shall mention some of recent date. Hear the protest of Priscus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_363_c" id="target_note_LCL239_363_c"><sup>c</sup></a> a bishop of the province of Caesarea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_363_d" id="target_note_LCL239_363_d"><sup>d</sup></a>: “Either the office of Primate ought to be open to me too, or else I ought not to retain my episcopal office.” Let the protest be heard of another bishop of the same province, Victor, who when left in the same fault as Priscus, is not allowed to receive communion from any bishop unless within his own diocese—let his protest, I repeat, be heard: “Either I ought to communicate anywhere, or else I ought not to communicate even in my own district.” Let. the protest be heard of a third bishop of the same province, Laurentius, and

One or other of them is probably the case which took Augustine to Mauretania about 418 (“litteras... quas ad Mauretaniam Caesariensem misisti, me apud Caesaream praesente venerunt, quo nos iniuncta nobis a venerabili papa Zosimo apostolicae sedis episcopo ecclesiastica necessitas traxerat,” Ep. cxc. 1).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_363_c').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL239_363_d"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL239_363_d" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">d</sup>Caesarea was one of the two portions of Mauretania, which was incorporated in the Empire by Caligula in <span class="sc">a.d</span>. 40.
