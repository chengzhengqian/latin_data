and that saying that is written in the Holy Books is true, because divine: “He that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_497_a" id="target_note_LCL239_497_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Hating then my own soul as I did, how could I have a true friend in one who wished me those things in which I was suffering myself to be my own enemy? “But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_497_b" id="target_note_LCL239_497_b"><sup>b</sup></a> dawned upon me, not according to my merits, “but according to His mercy,” how could you, when you were a stranger to it, be my friend?
