the great advantage the work you were doing would be to the churches of Christ, if you pursued it with the sole purpose of protecting them from the hostile attacks of barbarians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_421_a" id="target_note_LCL239_421_a"><sup>a</sup></a> so that they might live, as the apostle says, “a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_421_b" id="target_note_LCL239_421_b"><sup>b</sup></a> while you yourself would seek from this world nothing but what was necessary for the maintenance of your own life and that of your household, girding yourself with the chastest continence, and wearing along with the armour of the body the surer and stronger defence of the armour of the spirit.</p>
<p>When, in consequence, we were rejoicing in this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> design of yours, you sailed for Italy and you married a wife<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_421_ca" id="target_note_LCL239_421_ca"><sup>c</sup></a>; your sailing was an act of obedience, which you owed, according to the apostle, to “the higher powers”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_421_d" id="target_note_LCL239_421_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; but you would not have married a wife if you had not been overcome by desire and abandoned the continence you took upon yourself. When I learned of this, I confess I was thunderstruck with amazement, yet in some measure I found consolation for my grief in the fact that I heard you had refused to marry her until she turned Catholic. But in spite of that, the heresy of those who deny the true Son of God has acquired such influence in your home that it was by them that your daughter was baptized. If the report that reached us was not untrue (and would to Heaven that it were!), that those same heretics have even re-baptized maidens consecrated to God, what fountains of tears we should need now to bewail
