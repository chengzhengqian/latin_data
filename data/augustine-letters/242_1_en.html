The astrologers themselves do not do so, for when one of them has sold his silly horoscopes to wealthy persons and turns his eyes away from the ivory tablets to the management and supervision of his own household, he immediately reproves his wife, not with objurgations only but even with blows, if he finds her not to say engaged in froward dalliance, but even looking too much out of the window. Yet if she were to say to him: “Why do you beat <span class="italic">me</span>? Beat Venus, if you can, for it is the influence of her planet that makes me do this,” his concern then is not what empty jargon he can concoct for the deception of strangers, but what just lashes he can inflict for the correction of his own household.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_485_b" id="target_note_LCL239_485_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
