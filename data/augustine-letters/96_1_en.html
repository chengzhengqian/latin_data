philosophers themselves, who were either completely without knowledge of God or else, “when they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened; professing themselves to be wise they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_193_a" id="target_note_LCL239_193_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or who, though not given, or not excessively given, to such images, yet “worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_193_b" id="target_note_LCL239_193_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Far be it, therefore, from us rightly to give the name of liberal studies to the lying conceits and follies, the empty trifles and complacent misrepresentations of those unhappy men who did not recognize the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by which alone we are delivered “from the body of this death,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_193_c" id="target_note_LCL239_193_c"><sup>c</sup></a> even in those things which they felt to be true. Their historical works, whose writers claim to be especially reliable in their narratives, contain something perhaps that may fitly be learned by the free, since what they narrate, whether the fortunes or the misfortunes of mankind, is at any rate true. And yet, I completely fail to see how men who were without the assistance of the Holy Spirit, and were compelled by the very nature of human infirmity to gather mere rumours together, were not in their search for facts mistaken in most of them. Yet in such writings there is an approximation to liberty, provided that the writers have no intention of deceiving and do not mislead men, except in so far as they themselves, through human infirmity, are misled by their informants.</p>
