asked of him what they should do, and he made answer to them: “Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_329_a" id="target_note_LCL239_329_a"><sup>a</sup></a> To be sure, when he commanded them to be content with their military wages, he did not forbid them to serve as soldiers.</p>
<p>They have a greater place before God, who<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> abandon all these worldly employments to serve him with the strictest self-discipline and chastity; “but everyone,” as the apostle says, “hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner and another after that.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_329_b" id="target_note_LCL239_329_b"><sup>b</sup></a> There are some, then, who by praying for you fight against your invisible foes, while you by fighting for them are striving against the visible barbarians. Would that there were one faith in all, for there would be less of striving and the devil with his angels would be more easily overcome! But as it is necessary in this world that the citizens of the kingdom of heaven should be harassed by temptations among erring and irreverent men so that they may be exercised and tried as gold in the furnace,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_329_c" id="target_note_LCL239_329_c"><sup>c</sup></a> we ought not before the appointed time to desire to live with the saints and righteous alone, so that we may deserve to receive this blessedness in its own due time.</p>

For when faith is pledged, it is to be kept even with the enemy against whom you are waging war; how much more with the friend, for whose sake you are fighting! You ought to have peace as the object of your choice and war only as the result of necessity, so that God may deliver you from the necessity and preserve you
