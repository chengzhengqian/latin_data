and others which I think it better to pass over for the present, why should I make fun of your gods, when anyone who knows your type of mind and reads your letter can see that you yourself poke stealthy fun at them? So, if you want us to discuss this topic in a manner befitting your age and good sense and answering the just demands of my close friends from one of my profession, look for some theme worthy of debate between us, and do your best to put forward on your gods’ behalf arguments that will not make me think you are betraying your own case; for you certainly did suggest to me what can be said against them, rather than advance any statement on their behalf. Finally, I want to tell you something you should know, to keep you from being inadvertently drawn into irreverent gibes: Catholic Christians, who have a church established in your town too,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_31_aa" id="target_note_LCL239_31_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> worship no dead man and adore nothing as a deity that was made and created by God; they worship only God himself, who made and created everything.</p>
<p>I shall enlarge on these facts by the help of our one true God, when I am assured that you want to treat them seriously.</p>

<span class="sc">Note.</span>—The two preceding letters are among the best known and most frequently cited of Augustine’s correspondence. Voltaire, for example, several times (<span class="italic">Dict. Philosophique</span>,
<span class="italic">s.vv.</span> “Dieu,” “Idole”; <span class="italic">Traité sur la Tolérance</span>, ch. 9; “Notice sur Maxime de Madaure” at the head of his <span class="italic">Sophronime et Adelos</span>) quotes Maximus as evidence that the polytheism of his time was tolerant, philosophical, and deistic. The monotheistic explanation was by now current among the better educated pagans (<span class="italic">cf. P.L.</span> iii. 1107 “gentiles quamvis idola colant, tamen summum Deum Patrem creatorem cognoscunt
et confitentur”; Maximus’s own words are almost a literal translation of the verse quoted by Lactantius, <span class="italic">Inst.</span> i. 6. 15 εἶς θεός, ὃς μόνος ἄρχει, ὐπερμεγέθης, ἀγένητος); but it was largely inspired by the struggle against Christianity and it was never more than a controversial argument, forgotten in polytheistic practice. His case for paganism is largely aesthetic and sentimental; in attacking Christianity he undoubtedly strikes at the weakest point of its popular observance, the cult of saints and martyrs, the concession made by Christianity to local, polytheistic hero-worship. But he confuses Donatism, strong in the region round Madaura, with orthodox Christianity, and his remarks about the villainous character of those popular objects of veneration are beside the mark. Augustine in reply attacks the disreputable cults and practices of paganism and treats Maximus’s arguments, both for paganism and against Christianity, with contempt.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_31_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
