For while I am dictating this letter to you, I have a picture of you yourself in my mind, though naturally you are far away and unaware of my thoughts, and, in the light of my inward knowledge of you, I try to see how my words can affect you; and I fail to comprehend and discover how that process takes place in my mind, though I am sure that it is not caused by material particles or material qualities, although the actual picture is very like something material.

The twelfth book is a study of St. Paul’s vision, 2 Cor. xii. 2–4, and of supernatural visions in general. He had already before his ordination to the priesthood begun a controversial exposition of Genesis directed against the Manichees (<span class="italic">De Genesi contra Manichaeos</span>), but later he came to the opinion that this treatise was too allegorical, so he undertook, first, about 393, a literal exposition (<span class="italic">De Genesi ad litteram imperfectus liber</span>), then the work mentioned here.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_277_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL239_277_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL239_277_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>Gennadius is not otherwise known.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_277_b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
