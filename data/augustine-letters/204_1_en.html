against the new heretics, the Pelagians, who declare that the grace of God is bestowed according to our merits; so that he who glories has to glory, not in the Lord, but in himself, that is, in man, not in the Lord. Now this is forbidden by the apostle, in the words, “Let no man glory in man,” and in another place he says, “He that glorieth let him glory in the Lord.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_409_a" id="target_note_LCL239_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a> But these heretics, imagining that they become righteous of themselves, as if it was they themselves and not God who granted this to them, consistently enough glory in themselves and not in the Lord. To such the apostle says, “Who maketh thee to differ from another?”,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_409_b" id="target_note_LCL239_409_b"><sup>b</sup></a> saying this on the ground that what makes a man to differ from that mass of perdition which had its origin in Adam and makes him a vessel unto honour and not unto dishonour,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_409_c" id="target_note_LCL239_409_c"><sup>c</sup></a> is God alone. But since carnal man, swollen with empty pride, might, on hearing the question “Who maketh thee to differ from another?”, make answer either in thought or in word and say, “It is my faith that makes me to differ; my prayers that make me to differ; my righteousness that makes me to differ,” the apostle at once met these thoughts half-way and said, “For what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou didst not receive it?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_409_d" id="target_note_LCL239_409_d"><sup>d</sup></a> For they glory just as if they did not receive it, those who imagine they are justified of themselves; they glory therefore in themselves and not in the Lord.</p>
