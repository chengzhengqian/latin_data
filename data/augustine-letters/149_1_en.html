The “wrong interpretation”
refers to the Donatist practice of adducing in support of their re-baptizing of Catholics the text from Ecclus. xxxiv. 25, “qui baptizatur a mortuo, et iterum tangit mortuum, quid ei prodest lavacrum eius?” with the omission of the middle clause, “if he touch it again,” and a monstrous perversion of the meaning.
