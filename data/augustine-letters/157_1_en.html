For that reason it is written, “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_315_a" id="target_note_LCL239_315_a"><sup>a</sup></a> not that no one will be damned, but that no one will be delivered in any other way; for just as all those who are children of men are so through Adam, so all those who are children of God are so through Christ. So all children of men are able to become such only through Adam, and all of them who have become children of God, only through Christ. Let him therefore openly express his views on this further point, whether he accepts the fact that even little children, who have not yet reached the stage of willing righteousness or of refusing it, yet because of one man, by whom “sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_315_b" id="target_note_LCL239_315_b"><sup>b</sup></a> are delivered by the grace of Christ—whether even for them, because of original sin, he believes that the blood of Christ was shed, which was, to be sure, shed for the remission of sins.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_315_c" id="target_note_LCL239_315_c"><sup>c</sup></a> About these points in particular I am anxious to know what he believes and holds, what he definitely confesses and preaches. In the other points, however, that are raised against him, even if he be proved to be in error, none the less until he accepts correction, it is more tolerable to bear with him.</p>

This I beg at the desire of many bishops who have, like me, been troubled by the indefinite rumour about this; I have written, however, asking this in my own name for the reason that I did not want to miss the opportunity of the messenger, who is in a position, I understand, to return to us speedily.
