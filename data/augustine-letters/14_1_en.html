Saturn and such–like gods of yours were once men; he had read that mythical tale confirmed by ancient authority and known to Tully as well, for in his Dialogues<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_29_a" id="target_note_LCL239_29_a"><sup>a</sup></a> he draws attention to the same fact more explicitly than we should venture to ask, and tries, as far as those days allowed, to put it before men’s notice.</p>
<p>Then again, you state that your rites are to be<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> preferred to ours, on the ground that your worship is public, while we use more secret places of meeting. First, I ask you how it comes that you have forgotten your god Bacchus; you think he should be entrusted only to the eyes of the few who are initiated. Then you convict yourself of having had no other intention, in mentioning the public celebration of your rites, than that of making us envisage, as in a mirror, your senators and notable townsmen raging and revelling through your city streets. If in that celebration you have the presence of a deity within you, you surely see what kind of being he is, when he destroys your reason. But if this is only an assumed madness, what are those secret rites that you actually practise in public? Or what is the object of so vile a piece of deceit? Or again, if you are inspired seers, why do you foretell no future events? Or why do you rend, the clothes of the bystanders, if you are in your right mind?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_29_ba" id="target_note_LCL239_29_ba"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

The celebration was confined to the initiate, who, feigning frenzy, claimed the indwelling presence of their god and practised many cruel and orgiastic rites. The language of Arnobius (<span class="italic">Adv. Nat.</span> v. 19) closely resembles Augustine’s, and adds several other details: “Bacchanalia etiam praetermittemus inmania quibus nomen Omophagiis graecum est, in quibus furore mentito et sequestrata
pectoris sanitate circumplicatis vos anguibus atque ut vos plenos dei numine ac maiestate doceatis, caprorum reclamantium viscera cruentatis oribus dissipatis” (and also <span class="italic">infra</span>). See, too, Aug. <span class="italic">C.D</span>. vi. 9 and xviii. 13. There seems little evidence for this rending of bystanders’ clothes, but probably this is what is implied in Plautus, <span class="italic">Bacch</span>. 974 <span class="italic">sqq</span>. and <span class="italic">Aulul</span>. 408 “neque ego umquam nisi hodie ad Bacchas veni in bacchanal coquinatum, | ita me miserum et meos discipulos fustibus male contuderunt.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_29_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
