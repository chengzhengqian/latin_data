<p>Let your Charity not think me troublesome in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> wishing to have converse with you even by letter. I have given you these admonishments, not with the idea that you are failing to perform them, but in the belief that if what you do by His favour you do in remembrance of my exhortation, I have no slight commendation to God from you. For a good savour of Christ from your holy conduct had already reached me, first through rumour and now through the brethren, Eustasius and Andrew, who have come from you. Of these Eustasius has gone before us to that rest, which no waves beat upon as they do upon your island, nor does he long for Caprera, for in its hair-cloth he seeks no more his raiment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_117_c" id="target_note_LCL239_117_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>

It was a <span class="italic">castellum</span> under the early Empire, but became a colony about the time of Marcus Aurelius, as the name indicates (<span class="italic">colonia Aurelia Sufetana</span>). It had been a bishopric since at least <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 255, but Augustine’s language shows that the majority of its inhabitants were still pagan. In consequence,
apparently, of the legislation of 399, by which Honorius ordered the closing of pagan temples and the destruction of idols (<span class="italic">Cod. Theod.</span> <span class="sc">xvi.</span> x. 16, 17, 18), the Sufetan statue of Hercules had been destroyed, and in retaliation the townspeople had massacred sixty Christians. The cult of Hercules at Sufes is attested by an inscription to that god found among the ruins (<span class="italic">C.I.L</span>. viii. no. 262). The martyred Christians are commemorated on August 30 (<span class="italic">Martyrol. Rom</span>. III. Kal. Sept.; <span class="italic">Acta Sanctorum</span>, Aug. vi. 553). The letter is unusually difficult and the style makes it doubtful that Augustine is actually the writer.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_117_da').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
