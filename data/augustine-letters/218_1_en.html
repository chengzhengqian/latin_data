men’s lives, but of conquering “principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_437_a" id="target_note_LCL239_437_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that is, the devil and his angels.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_437_b" id="target_note_LCL239_437_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For these are the enemies whom the holy vanquish, enemies they cannot see; and yet they vanquish the enemies they cannot see by vanquishing the objects of their senses. But to that kind of life I am prevented from urging you, for your wife stands in the way, and without her consent you cannot adopt a life of continence; because, although you had no right to marry her after what you said at Tubunae, yet she became your wife in all innocence and single-mindedness, knowing nothing of your declaration. Yet would that you could persuade her to continence, so that with nothing in your way you could render unto God what you know you owe Him! But if you cannot arrange that with her, preserve at least your conjugal chastity and ask God, Who can “bring you out of your distresses,” to grant that you may be able to do sooner or later what you find impossible now. But yet, in order to love God, you must give up loving the world; in your warfare (if you have still to be engaged in it) keep the faith and ensue peace; use this world’s goods to do good deeds, and to obtain this world’s goods do not do evil deeds—in these duties a wife is not a hindrance, or ought not to be.</p>
<p>I have written thus to you, my beloved son, at the bidding of the love wherewith I love you, not in the way of this world, but in God’s way. And when I recall to mind the words of Scripture, “Reprove a wise man and he will love thee; reprove a fool and he will hate thee more,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_437_c" id="target_note_LCL239_437_c"><sup>c</sup></a> I had to think of you as surely not a fool, but a wise man.</p>
