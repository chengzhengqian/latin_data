glows with patriotic zeal, and I am not sorry, but rather delighted, to learn that you do not merely remember the maxim that “to good men there is no limit or end of devotion to their country,” but actually exemplify it in your life and character. That is why we should like to have you enrolled in person as a citizen of a country which is above, in holy love for which we endure perils and toil, as far as in us lies, among those whose good we seek in urging them to make that country their own—and such a citizen that you would think there should be no limit or end to devotion to that fragment of it which is on pilgrimage in this land. So would you become a better man in proportion as you discharged here and now the duties due to that better country, in whose eternal peace you will find no end to rejoicing, if you prescribe for yourself no end to the devotion you bestow upon its temporal tasks.</p>

Here, Nectarius’s use of the word <span class="italic">florere,</span> “lower,” or “flourish,” of his own province recalls to Augustine Virgil’s use of the word with reference to Italy, and throughout the letter he keeps playing upon the words <span class="italic">florere</span> and <span class="italic">flores.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_153_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
