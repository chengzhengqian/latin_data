These two at once came to grips with the Donatist problem, but that party had as well its own internal difficulties.
Primianus became embroiled with a rival, Maximian, and at a synod held in the province of Byzacena, Primianus was deposed and Maximian appointed in his stead (June 393). Primianus rallied his supporters in Numidia, where the original strength of Donatism lay, and at Bagai, in April 394, a synod of Primianist Donatists restored him. The rebel Gildo, aided by the infamous Optatus, bishop of Timgad, supported their cause, but when the rebellion was put down in 398 the Donatists found themselves acutely divided and in great disfavour. The Catholic party invoked in 404 the aid of the secular arm, and Primianus was dispossessed, but soon returned, playing a prominent part in the Conference of 411. This marked a definite stage in the history of Donatism, and Primianus’s power was quite broken.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_297_ba').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL239_297_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL239_297_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup><span class="italic">Exsufflo</span> is a late word, properly “to breathe out,” “blow out,” as Cael.
