He judges me? That I had no opportunity for self improvement in the embarrassment of clerical duties? If He were to say to me: “Thou wicked servant,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_39_a" id="target_note_LCL239_39_a"><sup>a</sup></a> if some rogue were preying upon the Church’s property, the fruits of which are gathered with great expenditure of effort, and your intervention before an earthly bar could be of some avail, would not everyone agree and some even command and compel you to abandon the field that I watered with My own Blood and proceed to court, and if the verdict were unfavourable, even to make the journey across the sea?

To that liking and affection
