language is in general use, do you think it is our duty so to provide for the welfare of the Lord’s people that we send this ability to you and deprive ourselves of it here, where our need of it is so great and so heart-felt? Forgive me, then, for doing, not only in spite of your desire but also in spite of my own feelings, what my zeal for the office with which I am burdened compels me to do. The Lord, upon whom you have stayed your heart, will make your labours such that you will be rewarded for this kind service; for it is kind of you to surrender the deacon Lucillus to the thirsty eagerness of our territories rather than claim him for yourself. And it will be no small favour if you will refrain from laying upon me any request concerning this matter in the future, so that I may not appear to your revered and holy Benevolence to be only too hard-hearted.</p>

He was one of the legates sent by the senate to Honorius at Ravenna in 409 to deplore the misfortunes of Rome, where Alaric had broken his pledge. In 413 he was sent to Africa to examine the provincials’ complaints and the adjustment of the corn-tax. On his arrival in Carthage, he bore letters from Pope Innocent to Augustine, who addressed to him Ep. cli. The edict mentioned is the vigorous legislation of 412 against the Donatists. The Benedictine editors, followed by Goldbacher, assign this letter to the year 405, but Monceaux (<span class="italic">Hist. litt. de l’ Afrique chrétienne</span>, vii. 285) shows reasons for assigning it rather to early in 413.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_149_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
