wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_45_a" id="target_note_LCL239_45_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>Of these three classes, chambering and wantonness<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> are considered so great an offence that no one who has defiled himself with that sin is considered worthy not merely of holding office in the Church, but even of participation in the sacraments. And quite rightly so, but why single out these? Rioting and drunkenness are considered so permissible and tolerable that they are practised not only on holy days, when the blessed martyrs are honoured,—a lamentable sight to anyone who looks on such festivities with more than a carnal eye,—but even on any and every day. Were this depravity only immoral and not sacrilegious as well, we might think of putting up with it with what power of endurance we could. And yet, what about the same Apostle’s statement, when he ends his lengthy list of vices, among which drunkenness finds a place, by saying: “With such an one not even to eat bread”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_45_b" id="target_note_LCL239_45_b"><sup>b</sup></a>? Are we to put up with it in the disgraceful debauchery of private life and of those festivities that are confined to private houses, and receive the Body of Christ in the company of those with whom we are forbidden to eat bread? At least let such a disgraceful practice be removed from the cemeteries<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_45_ca" id="target_note_LCL239_45_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> where

Martyr.</span> 25 “annon videmus ad martyrum memorias Christianum a Christiano cogi ad ebrietatem?” Ambr. <span class="italic">Helia</span> xvii. 62 “calices ad sepulchra martyrum deferunt atque illic in vesperam bibunt,” etc). It was a survival of the old pagan custom of celebrating Parentalia or Feralia on the tombs of the dead, but, as Augustine says, the Church attempted to arrest this licence, not by complete suppression, but by converting the offering of bread and wine laid on the tombs (see <span class="italic">Conf.</span> vi. 2) to a nobler use. The martyr’s tomb was made an altar, round which was built the chapel dedicated to him and called by his name; this explains why, in the fourth century, churches were built outside the towns, for the cemeteries were there; only in the tenth century did the church reach the middle of the town. Further, the martyr’s fame and sanctity encouraged burial near him; hence the habit of burial within the church, and later around it. So throughout the Middle Ages the church and the cemetery were the sacred place of the people: there they held their plays, their dances (Giraldus Cambrensis describes one in Wales in 1188, <span class="italic">Itin. Kambr</span>. i. 2), their revels and even their drinking—bouts, in spite of repeated prohibitions by Church Councils.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_45_ca').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
