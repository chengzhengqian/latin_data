<p>Therefore let his promise be fulfilled and the heart<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span> of the weak brethren be healed, so that this notable precedent may not encourage those who approve of it to commit similar perjury, or those who disapprove of it to say with perfect justice that no one of us is to be believed, not only on promise of anything, but even on oath. In this connexion we ought rather to safeguard ourselves against the tongues of our enemies, which our greater enemy employs like darts to slay the weak. But be it far from us to hope for anything from a soul like his, other than what the fear of God inspires, and its own great, native excellence of holiness exhorts. As for myself, you say I ought actually to have forbidden his oath, but I confess I could not be so minded as to prefer seeing the church I serve overthrown by such an uproarious outbreak to accepting the offer made to me by a man of his standing.</p>

This conference took place in June 411, and in spite of the impartiality and moderation shown by Marcellinus, the Donatists accused him of receiving bribes (Ep. cxli.; <span class="italic">Cod. Theod</span>. xvi. 11. 5). In this letter, and in cxxxviii. and cxxxix., Augustine deplores the violence of the Circumcellions, but exhorts him to show mercy to those misguided fanatics. Marcellinus and Augustine were on terms of close friendship, and to him Augustine dedicated his <span class="italic">De Peccatorum Meritis et Remissione, De Spiritu et Littera</span>, and the first two books of the <span class="italic">De Civitate Dei</span>, which he says were written at Marcellinusâ€™s suggestion. In 413, during the revolt of Heraclian, Marcellinus
and his brother were seized, imprisoned, and, in spite of a petition from several of the African bishops, put to death. Ep. cli. narrates the circumstances of his death and pays a noble tribute to his memory. The impartial conduct of Marcellinus towards the Donatists was commemorated in an imperial decree (<span class="italic">Cod. Theod.</span> xvi. 5. 55), and his memory is honoured by the Church of Rome on April 6.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_251_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
