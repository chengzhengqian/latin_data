concerned about the later translators; they are said to have possessed a more thorough grip of the course and the rules of Hebrew words and phrases, and yet they are not only at variance with each other, but have also left many points that have remained to be unearthed and brought to light after so long. For if these points are obscure, then it is quite credible that you too may go astray in them; if they are clear, it is incredible that they could have gone astray in them. I should like to ask you of your kindness to explain the reasons for this state of things and to give me some assurance about it.</p>

For it seems to me very disastrous to believe that there can be any falsehood in the sacred books—I mean that those men who wrote and transmitted to us the Scripture, in any way lied in what they wrote.

St. Peter’s inconsistent conduct at Antioch, in first eating with the Gentiles and later withdrawing from them (Gal. ii. 11–14), was found difficult to explain; both heretics and pagans used the incident to discredit either Paul or Peter and the Church as well. One commentator, Clement of Alexandria, cut the knot by declaring that the Cephas mentioned in Galatians was not St. Peter, but a disciple of the same name; Origen invented the disingenuous and worse theory that the dispute between the two apostles was simulated in order the more severely to condemn the Judaizers. This view found wide acceptance: it was defended and urged by Chrysostom and, in the West, with characteristic vigour, by Jerome. Augustine here and in other letters denounces this interpretation as subversive of the whole authority of Scripture. Jerome eventually accepted Augustine’s view, which became generally accepted. A full account of the controversy is given in Lightfoot’s commentary on Galatians, pp. 128–132.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_61_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
