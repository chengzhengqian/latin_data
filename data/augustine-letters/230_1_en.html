from your lips; inform them of this my request, or rather, if you esteem me highly, consider that my request is a command; in any case, grant my request or carry out my command: pray for me. Read God’s letters and you will find that the apostles themselves, the leaders<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_461_aa" id="target_note_LCL239_461_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> of the flock, requested this from their children or enjoined it on their hearers. For myself, since you make the same request from me for yourself, He Who answers prayer sees to what extent I am doing it, and saw to what extent I was doing it even before; but in this matter do you show me an equal return of love. We are your overseers, and you are God’s flock. Reflect and see that our dangers are greater than yours, and pray for us (for this profits both us and you) that we may render a good account of you to the Chief Shepherd<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_461_b" id="target_note_LCL239_461_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and Head of us all and that we may likewise escape this world’s allurements, more dangerous than its afflictions, unless when its peace makes for that for which the apostle warned us to pray, that is, “that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_461_c" id="target_note_LCL239_461_c"><sup>c</sup></a> For if godliness and honesty be wanting, what is quietness and peaceableness from those and the other evils of the world but an opportunity for self-indulgence and destruction, either by inviting to it or by assisting towards it? So, then, that we may obtain this “quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty” which my prayers ask for you, let your prayers ask it for me, wherever you are, wherever we are; for He is everywhere, “Whose we are.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_461_d" id="target_note_LCL239_461_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
