Then again, concerning strife and envying, what<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> right have I to speak, since such sins are more serious among ourselves than among the laity? These evils are the offspring of pride and eagerness for the praise of men, which often begets hypocrisy as well.
