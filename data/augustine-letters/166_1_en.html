upon it. This letter, then, may rather serve as a mirror to you, in which you can behold what manner of man you are, rather than as a lesson to you what manner of man you ought to be. And yet, whatever you find either in this letter or in Holy Scripture that you still lack for a good life, be instant in prayer and in deeds, so that you may acquire it; and from what you have, render thanks to God as the fount of goodness, from Whom you have received it, and in all your good deeds ascribe the glory to God and the humility to yourself, for, as it is written, “Every good and perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of lights.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_333_a" id="target_note_LCL239_333_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Yet whatever progress you make in the love of God and of your neighbour and in genuine godliness, do not imagine that you are without sin, as long as you are in this life, concerning which we read in Holy Writ, “Is not the life of man upon earth a life of temptation?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_333_b" id="target_note_LCL239_333_b"><sup>b</sup></a> And so, since it is necessary for you, as long as you are in this body, always to say in prayer what the Lord taught us, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_333_c" id="target_note_LCL239_333_c"><sup>c</sup></a> remember quickly to forgive anyone who has sinned against you and has asked for pardon, so that you may be able to pray with sincerity and succeed in obtaining pardon for your own sins.</p>
<p>I have written these exhortations to you, my dear friend, in haste, as the haste of the bearer compelled me, but I render thanks to God that I have in some degree been able to comply with your holy desire. May the mercy of God always be your protection, my noble lord and deservedly distinguished and honourable son!</p>
