heard indeed in the very words of Antoninus: “Either I ought to sit in the see to which I was ordained, or else I ought not to be a bishop at all.” But who would find fault with those sentences, except one who does not reflect that, on the one hand, all these offences must not be left unpunished, and on the other, that they are not all to be punished in the same way?</p>
<p>In his letter about Antoninus, addressed to his<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> bishop, the saintly Pope Boniface, with the vigilance and caution of a true pastor, put the words, “Provided that he has faithfully revealed the sequence of events to us.” So now accept this statement of the sequence of events which he in his memorandum passed over in silence, and further, of what happened after the letter of that man of blessed memory was read in Africa; do you come to the aid of men who implore your aid in Christ’s mercy more earnestly than did he, from whose harassment they seek deliverance. For threats are being made to the people, either by Antoninus himself or by oft-repeated rumours,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_365_aa" id="target_note_LCL239_365_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> of legal processes and public officials and military attacks that are to enforce the decision of the Apostolic See; in consequence, those unfortunate people, though Catholic Christians, are in dread of heavier punishment from a Catholic bishop than what they feared from the laws of Catholic emperors when they were heretics.

Besides asking the Pope not to allow appeals from Africa or to receive those excommunicated in Africa, the bishops asked him not to send his clerks to carry out his sentences, lest the Church should appear to be introducing “the smoky vanity of the world” (“fumosum typhum saeculi”) (<span class="italic">Cod.

The letter of an African Council to Pope Celestine: “deinceps ad vestras aures hinc venientes non facilius admittatis, nec a nobis excommunicatos ultra velitis excipere;... executores etiam clericos vestros quibuscumque petentibus nolite mittere, nolite concedere.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_365_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL239_365_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL239_365_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>1 Pet. v. 3.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_365_b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
