<p>Why need I dilate upon the point to your Holiness,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> when I already realize that I am wearying you, especially as you listen to my letter through an interpreter?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_313_a" id="target_note_LCL239_313_a"><sup>a</sup></a> If you love Pelagius, may he too love you, or rather deceive himself and not you! For when you hear him confessing God’s grace and God’s help, you think he means the same as you do, who understand them in the light of the Catholic rule of faith, because you are unacquainted with what he has written in his book. For this reason I have sent the book itself and the reply I wrote to it; from these your Reverence may see what grace or help of God he speaks of, when the objection is made to him that he is speaking of something opposed to the grace and help of God. Open his eyes then by teaching and exhorting him and praying for the salvation he ought to have in Christ, so that he may confess that grace of God the saints are proved to have confessed, when they sought those things from the Lord which He commanded them to seek, for those things would have not been commanded unless to the end that our will should be revealed, nor would they be asked for, unless to the end that the weakness of our will should have the help of Him who commanded them.</p>
<p>Let the question be openly put to him whether he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> approves of praying the Lord that we fall not into sin. If he disapproves of it, let the apostle be read in his ears, in the words, “Now I pray to God that ye do no evil”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_313_b" id="target_note_LCL239_313_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; but if he does approve of it, let him openly preach that grace which assists us, so that he himself may be kept from doing much evil. For it is by this grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord that all those who are delivered, are delivered, since no one can be delivered in any other way than through it.
