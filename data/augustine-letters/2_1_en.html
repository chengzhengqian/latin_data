His kindly nature would make him second my efforts to keep contact with you by as many letters as I can send, even when your duties drive you farther away from us.</p>

He attended Augustine’s lectures in Carthage, became a Manichee when he did, followed him to Italy and was present during the struggle that preceded Augustine’s conversion. They were baptized together, then shared the monastic life at Tagaste from 391 to 394, when Alypius visited Jerome at Bethlehem. Alypius became bishop of Tagaste some months before Augustine’s elevation to Hippo, and held that post till his death about 430.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_5_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL239_5_ba"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL239_5_ba" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>Nebridius, born near Carthage, had accompanied Augustine to Rome and Milan, “for no other reason than that he might live with me in the most ardent pursuit of truth and wisdom” (<span class="italic">Confessions,</span> vi. 17).
