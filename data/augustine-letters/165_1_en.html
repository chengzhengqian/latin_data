in peace; for peace is not sought in order that war may be aroused, but war is waged in order that peace may be obtained. So then be a peace-maker even when warring, that by overcoming those whom you conquer, you may bring them to the advantages of peace, for “blessed are the peace-makers,” says the Lord, “for they shall be called the children of God.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_331_a" id="target_note_LCL239_331_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Yet if human peace is so sweet for procuring the temporal salvation of men, how much sweeter is peace with God for procuring the eternal salvation of the angels! So let it be your necessity and not your choice that slays the enemy who is fighting against you. Just as violence is the portion of him who rebels and resists, so mercy is the due of him who has been conquered or captured, especially when a disturbance of the peace is not to be feared.</p>
<p>Let your character be adorned by chastity in the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> marriage-bond, adorned by sobriety and moderation, for it is a very disgraceful thing that lust should overcome one whom man finds unconquerable, and that wine should overwhelm one whom the sword assails in vain. If you lack earthly riches, let them not be sought in the world by evil works; but if you possess them, let them be laid up in heaven by good works. The manly Christian spirit ought neither to be elated by their accession nor depressed by their departure. Let us rather keep in mind what the Lord says, “Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_331_b" id="target_note_LCL239_331_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and certainly when we hear the exhortation to lift up our hearts, we ought unfeignedly to make the response which you know we do make.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_331_c" id="target_note_LCL239_331_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
<p>In such matters as this, however, I know that you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span> are very zealous, and I take great delight in your reputation and greatly congratulate you in the Lord
