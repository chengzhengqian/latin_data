of its corruptible members, and victory over men who are our foes, and honour and temporal power and all other earthly blessings, are bestowed upon both the good and the evil and are taken away from both the good and the evil? But the health of the soul, along with the immortality of the body, and the strength of righteousness and victory over the desires that are our foes, and glory and honour and peace for evermore, are bestowed upon the good alone. These things, then, love and desire and seek by every possible means. To secure them and hold them fast, give alms, pour forth prayers, practise fasting as much as you can without harming your body; but love not those earthly blessings, however much you may abound in them. Make such use of them that you do many good deeds by them and no single evil deed because of them. For all such things will pass away, but good deeds do not pass away, even those which are done with the aid of the good things that pass away.</p>

On the other hand, it was used too by Christian writers of the service of the world, sin, or the devil (Aug. <span class="italic">Conf,</span> ix. 8. 17 “relicta militia saeculari accinctus in Tua”).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_435_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
