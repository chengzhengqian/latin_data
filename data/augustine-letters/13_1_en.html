who in these words invites your Hercules to the rites celebrated in his honour by Evander:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Us and thy rites with prosperous foot approach,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In favouring mood.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_27_a" id="target_note_LCL239_27_a"><sup>a</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">He prays him to come “with prosperous foot”; that is, he wants Hercules to come as Namphamo, in whom it pleases you to find much to taunt us with. But if you do take delight in jests, you have in your own religion ample material for ridicule: Stercutius, your god of manure, Cluacina, your goddess of purification, Bald Venus, your god Fear, your god Pallor, your goddess Fever, and countless others of the same kind, to whom the ancient Romans, worshippers of idols, built temples and thought worship should be offered.

<p class="noindent">If you are satisfied with Virgil’s authority, as you indicate that you are, then you will certainly be satisfied with these lines too:</p>
<blockquote><p>

<span class="line">Fleeing Jove’s arms, an exile from his realm,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_27_c" id="target_note_LCL239_27_c"><sup>c</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
