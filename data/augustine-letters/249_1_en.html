this would become one of your age<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_499_a" id="target_note_LCL239_499_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and be appropriate, in my opinion, to your character. Remember your remark to me when I was on the point of leaving you; you recalled that verse from one of Terence’s comedies, but still, though from a comedy, very apposite and proper:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">To-day now introduces a different life</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent8">and demands a different character.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_499_b" id="target_note_LCL239_499_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">If you were sincere in quoting it, as I have no right to doubt you were, you certainly are living now in such a way as to be worthy of receiving through the saving rite of baptism the remission of your past sins. There is none other at all, save the Lord Christ, to whom the human race can say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Under Thy guidance, whatso tracks remain</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Of our old wickedness, once done away,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Shall free the earth from never-ceasing fear.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_499_c" id="target_note_LCL239_499_c"><sup>c</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Virgil confessed to adopting this thought from the Cumaean, that is, the Sibylline, prophecy, and perhaps that seer too had had some message to her spirit about the only Saviour, which she had of necessity to confess.</p>
<p>This, my lord deservedly honoured and brother cherished in Christ and longed for, be it little or be it perchance much, I have at any rate written you, though in one way and another extremely engrossed in business. I long to receive a reply from you and to learn at any moment that you have entered your name among the candidates for baptism or are on the point of doing so. May the Lord God, in Whom you have put your trust, keep you, my lord deservedly honoured and brother cherished in Christ and longed for, both here and in the world to come!</p>

The habit of postponing baptism as long as possible was still very common; Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus and Chrysostom, though the sons of Christian mothers, received baptism only when of mature years, and Augustine himself was baptized only at the age of 33. Infant baptism was not the general rule until the following century.
