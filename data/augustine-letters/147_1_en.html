orderly manner about this very question of separation. The minutes were written down; further, our signatures are on record. Read them, or have them read to you, and choose then which you prefer. I have heard you have stated that you could have some discussion with us about those minutes, if we leave out the words of your bishops, in which it is said, “One case does not compromise another case, nor one person another person.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_295_aa" id="target_note_LCL239_295_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> You want us to leave these words out, which truth itself spoke through them, though they knew it not. But you will say that in this point they were mistaken and through lack of foresight fell into a false opinion; we say that what they said was true, and we very easily prove this by referring to yourself. For if you refuse to allow those bishops of yours, chosen by the entire Donatist party to represent the whole body in such wise that whatever they did, the rest should take as satisfactory and acceptable, to prejudice your case by what you hold to be a rash and incorrect statement on their part, by this refusal you admit the truth of their statement that one case does not compromise another case, nor one person another person.

His point here is that, on this Donatist admission that one man’s guilt does not affect another, the crimes alleged by the Council of Carthage in 312 against Caecilian in no way affect his successors, still less the Church Universal.
