case he go down to death in false security? It is a usual experience and a common occurrence for one who is reproved to be mortified at the time<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_373_a" id="target_note_LCL239_373_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and to wrangle and be recalcitrant, yet afterwards to reflect within himself<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_373_b" id="target_note_LCL239_373_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in silence, alone with God, where he is not afraid of displeasing men by being reproved, but is afraid to displease God by refusing correction, and thenceforward to refrain from doing the thing for which he was justly rebuked, and in proportion as he hates his sin, to love the brother whom he realizes to have been the enemy of his sin. But if he belongs to the number of those of whom it is written, “Rebuke a fool and he will go on to hate thee,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_373_c" id="target_note_LCL239_373_c"><sup>c</sup></a> the contention is not born of his love, but yet it tries and tests the love of his reprover, since he does not repay hatred with hatred, but the love which prompted his rebuke endures undisturbed, even when he who was rebuked requites it with hatred. If the reprover, however, choose to render evil for evil to the man who takes offence at being reproved, he was not fit to reprove another, but clearly fit to be reproved himself. Act upon these principles, so that occasions of provocation may either not arise among you, or, when they do occur, be immediately quenched in speedy peace. Strive more earnestly to disseminate harmony among yourselves than to encourage fault-finding, for just as vinegar corrodes a vessel if it remain too long in it, so anger corrodes the heart if it linger on to another day.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_373_d" id="target_note_LCL239_373_d"><sup>d</sup></a> “These things, therefore, do, and the God of peace shall be with you.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_373_e" id="target_note_LCL239_373_e"><sup>e</sup></a> At the same time pray for us, that we may with cheerful mind carry out the good advice we have given you.</p>
