with me. If it is my learning in liberal studies,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_101_a" id="target_note_LCL239_101_a"><sup>a</sup></a> in which he perhaps is uninstructed or less instructed than I am, what has this to do with an inquiry which is to be conducted about Holy Scripture and ecclesiastical or public records? In these he has so many years of experience, which should make him all the better equipped. In the last resort, my brother and colleague, Samsucius, bishop of the Church of Turres,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_101_b" id="target_note_LCL239_101_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is here, and he has acquired no such learning as your man is said to be afraid of; let him come and conduct it with him. I shall ask him, and I trust in the name of Christ he will readily agree to undertake to be my substitute in this. Though he is without any grace of eloquence, yet he is learned in the true faith, and the Lord will help him, I feel sure, in his contest for the truth. There is then no reason why he should refer me to any others, instead of settling between ourselves a matter which concerns ourselves. But still, as I said before, I do not decline to meet those others, if he himself demands their aid.</p>

He was instrumental in converting Victorinus and was a close and honoured friend of Ambrose’s. Augustine met him at Milan in 386, and was much influenced by his account of Victorinus’s conversion (<span class="italic">Confess.</span> viii. 5). To him Augustine dedicated his work <span class="italic">De Diversis Quaestionibus</span>, alluded to below, and he mentions him with great respect in several of his other works (<span class="italic">De Praedest</span>. 8; <span class="italic">De Dono Persev</span>. 52; <span class="italic">Civ.
