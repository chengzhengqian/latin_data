has laid low all the empty swellings of his pride and prostrated himself in meekness and humility to receive God as his teacher?</p>
<p>Since then we have first to be reduced from the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> vanity of pride to humility, so that rising thence we may acquire real exaltation, it was impossible for us to have communicated to us this spirit (the more glorious for its very gentleness) whereby our ungovernableness
is subdued by persuasion instead of by force, had not this Word—through Whom God the Father reveals Himself to the angels,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_475_a" id="target_note_LCL239_475_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Who is His strength and wisdom, Whom the human heart, blinded by the desire for things visible, was unable to perceive—condescended to act out His part in human form and exhibit His being in such a way as to make mankind more afraid of being uplifted by the pride of man than of being brought low by the example of God. So the Christ Who is preached throughout the world is not a Christ Who is adorned with an earthly kingdom, nor a Christ rich in earthly possessions, nor a Christ shining with any earthly splendour, but Christ crucified.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_475_b" id="target_note_LCL239_475_b"><sup>b</sup></a> This was a matter for ridicule at first by proud nations and still is to a remnant, but it was a matter for faith first to a few, now to nations, for then according to the faith of the few and in spite of the ridicule of the nations, when Christ crucified was preached, the lame walked, the dumb spoke, the deaf heard, the blind saw, and the dead rose again.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_475_c" id="target_note_LCL239_475_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Thus at last conviction was brought to the pride of the world that nothing in the world itself was more potent than divine humility, so that under the protection of that divine example the most wholesome human humility may find shelter against the scornful assaults of pride.</p>
