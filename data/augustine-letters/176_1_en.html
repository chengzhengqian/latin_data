<p>First of all I pay my tribute of congratulation to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> your merits that the Lord our God has placed you in that apostolic chair with (as we are informed) no division among His people. In the next place, I lay before your Holiness the state of affairs with us, so that you may come to our assistance not only by praying for us, but also by giving us your counsel and assistance,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_353_c" id="target_note_LCL239_353_c"><sup>c</sup></a> for I am writing to your Holiness under deep affliction: by my lack of foresight and caution I have brought a great disaster upon certain members of Christ in our neighbourhood, though I had intended only their benefit.</p>

Later, the African bishops decided not to allow appeals from Africa to Rome, and when in 426 Celestine wrote on behalf of a priest deposed from office, they pointed out that the African Church retained the right of judging its own causes (<span class="italic">Cod.

A later letter (Ep. ccxxiv.) speaks of a priest of Fussala. It was still a bishopric in 484, and a passage of Procopius mentions the construction of a fortress there under Justinian. In <span class="italic">Civ. Dei</span> xxii. 8. 6 is mention of a private estate near Fussala, on which the owner had built a chapel in which he placed soil from the Holy Sepulchre. The bishop mentioned below, Antoninus, was present at the Council of Mileve in 416 (Ep. clxxvi., title), but in view of his misdeeds Augustine assumed control himself (§ 5, <span class="italic">cf</span>. Ep. ccxxiv.), and retained it till his death. <span class="italic">Castellum</span> is defined by Augustine himself in <span class="italic">De Consensu Evang</span>. iii. 25. 71: “castellum . . . non absurde accipimus etiam villam potuisse appellari.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_353_da').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
