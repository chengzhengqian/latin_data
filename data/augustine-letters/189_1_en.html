the garden of the Lord among you as to reap these thorns from you<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_379_a" id="target_note_LCL239_379_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; yet if your weakness still causes turmoil, pray to be delivered from temptation.

<p>Consider what an evil thing it is that we should<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> have to bewail internal discords in your monastery, when we are rejoicing over the Donatists<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_379_da" id="target_note_LCL239_379_da"><sup>d</sup></a> in unity. Be steadfast in the good purpose you have set before you and you will not desire to change your superior; steadfastly abiding in that monastery for so many years, she begot you not of the body, but of the soul, and you have grown both in numbers and in age. All of you, when you came to it, found her either doing service that was well-pleasing to the holy superior my sister, or else acting as superior herself and adopting you. Under her you received your training, under her you took the veil, under her you have been increased; and yet you demand with all this clamour that we should replace her for you, when you ought to be lamenting if we proposed to replace her for you. She is the one you have learned to know; she is the one to whom at first you came; she is the one under whom for so many years you have grown. No new official has been given you except the priest-superior; or if it be because of him that you seek some new thing and through jealousy for him that you have thus rebelled
