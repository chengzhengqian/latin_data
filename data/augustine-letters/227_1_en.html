just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. Those things, which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me, do; and the God of peace shall be with you.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_455_a" id="target_note_LCL239_455_a"><sup>a</sup></a> So the
other things he mentioned above he included under the word “virtue,” saying, “If there be any virtue”; what he meant by the words, “Whatsoever things are of good report,” he followed up by the single, appropriate phrase, “If there be any praise.” So his words, “If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ,” are to be understood in this way, as if he had said, “If I were doing the good I do with the motive of receiving human praise, I should be ‘swelling with the lust for praise.’” The apostle wanted therefore to please all men, and found joy in pleasing those whom he edified in Christ by receiving their praise, not those whose praise made him swell within himself. Why should I not therefore find pleasure in being praised by you, when you are (unless I am mistaken in you) a good man and bestow your praise upon the things which you admire and which it is profitable and wholesome for you to admire, even if they be lacking in me? This benefits not only you, but me too, for if they are lacking in me, it is wholesome for me to be shamed and inflamed with desire to acquire them. And so the qualities I recognize in your praises as my own I rejoice in possessing and in having you love them and me for their sake; those on the other hand that I fail to recognize as mine I yearn to acquire, not only in order to possess them for myself, but also to keep those who have a genuine love for me from being deluded when they praise me.</p>
