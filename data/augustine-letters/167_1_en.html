He had taken a leading

Firmus, the letter-bearer, appears several times in this capacity: visiting Jerome at Bethlehem in 405, he was entrusted with letters for Augustine

As the name implies, the acolytes were the immediate attendants and followers of the bishops; their specific duties were to light the candles of the church and to attend the officiating priest with wine for the Eucharist.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_335_b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
