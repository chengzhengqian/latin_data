<p>Just as severity is ready to punish the sins it discovers,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span>
so love is anxious not to discover sins to punish. That was the motive which withheld me from coming to you, when you besought my presence, not to rejoice in your peacefulness, but to increase your strife. For how could I have made light of your wrangling or left it unpunished, if even in my presence it had arisen to the same pitch as that which in my absence, though it was hidden from my eyes, yet assailed my ears with your clamour? Perhaps your rebelliousness would have been even greater in my presence, which it was necessary for me to withhold from you since you were demanding, to the detriment of sound discipline, things inexpedient for you and furnishing a most dangerous precedent. Thus I should not have found you such as I desire, and you would have found me such as you did not desire.</p>

In this its original form, it was part of a letter addressed to a convent of nuns in Hippo, probably that to which the last letter was written, although the circumstances do not appear to be quite identical. The Rule itself, the first actual monastic legislation
in Western Europe, was early adapted to communities of men, but it is not a complete system of rules for monastic observance, requiring expansion and elucidation from Augustine’s other ascetic writings, especially the <span class="italic">De Opere Monachorum</span> and <span class="italic">De Sancta Virginitate.</span> Here, for example, Augustine passes over the great monastic counsel of silence and touches but lightly on the subject of labour, yet the Rule became essentially that of the religious orders with an active mission. Nor, again, does he speak in detail of the liturgical offices, perhaps because in the Africa of his day there was no uniformity (Ep. lv. 34 “de hac re varia consuetudo est”) and no great enthusiasm for it (<span class="italic">ib</span>., “pleraque in Africa ecclesiae membra pigriora sunt”), except among the Donatists. Yet such as it is, the “Rule” had all the authority of his name and all the mingled severity and kindness of his nature to make it imposing to the medieval mind.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_375_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
