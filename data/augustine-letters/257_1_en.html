no divine orders for us to read. It is, indeed, written that women should have “modest apparel,” and “the wearing of gold” and “the broidering of the hair”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_515_a" id="target_note_LCL239_515_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and other suchlike things, usually employed either for empty show or to give allurement to the body, are deservedly condemned. But there is a kind of matronly dress, befitting a person’s station, distinct from the garments of a widow, which may become Christian wives without affronting Christian decorum. If your husband did not wish you to put that aside, so that you should not vaunt yourself as a widow while he was still alive,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_515_ba" id="target_note_LCL239_515_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> I am of opinion that on this point he should not have been driven to the scandal of quarrelling with you, for the harm done by your disobedience was greater than the good you did by any of your self-repression. For what is more preposterous than a wife’s domineering over her husband about a humble garment, when it would be more becoming in you to yield him compliance in shining deeds than to contend with him about gloomy clothes? Even if a nun’s dress pleased you, you would have been happier in assuming even it when you had shown due regard for your husband and received his permission, than in presuming to don that other, without asking his advice or paying him any respect. And if he altogether refused to allow it, wherein would your resolution have been the loser? Far be it from us to imagine you would displease

Stat. Eccl. Antiq.</span> 103 “viduae quae stipendiis ecclesiae sustentantur tam assiduae in Dei opere esse debent ut et meritis et orationibus suis ecclesiam adjuvent”); (2) a more honourable order, not confined to those over 60 or in need of support, who gained merit from abstaining from a second marriage. The widows who had taken this vow were distinguished by a special dress (“vestis fuscior,” Jerome, <span class="italic">Ep.</span> 38. 5), and the distinction seems to have been much coveted. This class of widows performed duties much like deaconesses, and by the eighth century they were compelled to leave their private houses and live in communities. Eventually, too, the order of widows was confused with that of deaconesses, and the ceremony of assuming widow’s dress was performed before the bishop, instead of remaining simply a private act of the widow herself.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_515_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
