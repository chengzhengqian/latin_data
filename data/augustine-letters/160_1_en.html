later could be sinless; for he declares he did not state that anyone would be found who from infancy to old age had not committed sin, but that after turning from sin by his own effort and with the help of God’s grace, he could live without sin. For when he says “turning from sin,” he shows that the earlier part of life was lived in sin. Let him then admit that Abel did sin, since his early life was lived in the world, and it, according to his admission, is not without sin; and let him take another look at his own book, where it is quite plain he did make the statement which in this defence he denies having made.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_321_aa" id="target_note_LCL239_321_aa"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

Now among these let each man choose whom to believe. It is not my business to discuss the matter at any greater length. I ask you to convey to him by a sure hand, if he denies that those are his opinions, the points to which objection is taken as being in conflict with the grace of Christ.

Pelagius has been trying to prove the sinlessness of Abel, in order to justify his own denial of the transmission of original sin and his theory that even before Christ there had been sinless lives. Augustine asks if he will maintain that Abel, whom he declares to have committed no sin, is therefore to be put on a level with Christ; assuming Pelagius will hardly go so far, he gives two alternatives: either Abel was not sinless in character, even if he did no sinful deed, or else he turned from sin—in either case, therefore, he was not without the taint of original sin which Pelagius is seeking to deny.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_321_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
