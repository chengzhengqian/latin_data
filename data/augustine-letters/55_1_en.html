What have I done, to be compelled to endure this thirst for news for two whole summers, and that too in Africa? What more shall I say? You are making daily distribution of what wealth you have—why

I do hope that it will at least be a groaning table at which you eventually receive my hungry appetite, so long denied the products of your pen. But if as yet it be not set and ready, my complaints will give you no respite if, while your book is finishing, you still leave me famishing.</p>
<p>Greet the brethren, especially Romanus and Agilis. Those who are with me here greet you. If they are less exasperated than I am, it is because their affection for you is less than mine.</p>

In 398, after Gildo’s rebellion, the Roman punitive force embarked at Pisa and put in at Cagliari in Sardinia; its leader, Gildo’s brother, visited Capraria and took on board some monks, who probably brought a letter to Augustine and were now to take back his reply (<span class="italic">cf.</span> Claudian, <span class="italic">Bell.
