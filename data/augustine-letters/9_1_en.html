<p>But I cannot disguise my impatience with such a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> misconception as yours. For who could bear to see Miggo esteemed above Jove, wielder of thunderbolts, Saname above Juno, Minerva, Venus, and Vesta, and your head-martyr, Namphamo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_19_aa" id="target_note_LCL239_19_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> (save the mark!), above all the immortal gods?
