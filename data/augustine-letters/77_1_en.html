country of yours we have experienced not so much “with what men it has flowered” as “with what arms it has blazed,” nay rather, not “arms,” but “fires,” and “not blazed,” but “set on fire.” If the heinous offence before us were left unpunished with no adequate chastisement of the miscreants, do you think that you would leave your country in full flower? Flowers indeed, but promising thorns, certainly not fruit! Just make the comparison and see whether you prefer your country to flower by practising piety or by escaping punishment, by the discipline of character or by the protection of violence; make the comparison and see whether in love for your country you outdo us, whether your desire to behold it in full flower is greater and more genuine than ours.</p>
<p>Look for a moment at those very books “On the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> State”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_155_a" id="target_note_LCL239_155_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from which you imbibed that sentiment of a loyal subject, that “to good men there is no limit or end of devotion to their country.” Look at them, I pray you, and notice the praise with which frugality and self-control are extolled, and fidelity to the marriage-bond, and chaste, honourable, and upright character. When a country is distinguished for these qualities, it may truly be said to be in full flower. Now, it is in the churches that are springing up throughout the world, in the sacred lecture-rooms, one might say, of the nations, that these moral qualities are being taught and learned, and most especially the piety with which worship is paid to the true and truthful God, Who not only commands men to undertake, but also gives them the power to perform, all those things by which the human spirit is trained and fitted for fellowship with God and for dwelling in the everlasting heavenly country. It is for that
