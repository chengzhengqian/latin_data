</section>
<p>I am very grateful for your kindness in cheering me by a letter from you and in giving me news of your welfare. The Lord recompense you, my greatly beloved lord and much longed for brother, with such blessings that you may be ever blessed and may live eternally with Him Who is eternal. Although I do not recognize myself in those encomiums of me contained in your Benevolence’s letter, yet I cannot be ungrateful for your goodwill towards one so insignificant as I. At the same time I urge you rather to pray for me, that the Lord may make me what you imagine I already am.</p>
<p>[<span class="italic">In another hand</span>] May you abide in safety and be well-pleasing unto the Lord, my greatly beloved lord and much longed for brother. Forget us not!</p>

Born in Britain, he was at Rome from about 401 to 409, when in consequence of the threatened invasion by Alaric, he withdrew to Sicily and afterwards to Africa. He visited Hippo when Augustine was absent, but they met later in Carthage. Pelagius soon sailed for Palestine, but his views were condemned by the Council of Carthage in 412. Augustine joined in the controversy, and between the Council and the writing of this letter wrote his treatises <span class="italic">De Peccatorum Meritis</span> and <span class="italic">De Spiritu et Littera</span>. Pelagius wrote from Palestine, and the above reply is cordial enough to show that Augustine was still hoping that Pelagius would see and renounce his error. At the Synod of Diospolis in 415 Pelagius used this letter, among others, as evidence of his good repute. Augustine was then led to defend himself from the charge of favouring the heretic, and in his <span class="italic">De Gestis Pelagii</span>, 50–53, he gives the text of his letter and discusses the language he used in it.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_267_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
