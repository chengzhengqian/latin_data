the fact that whatever praiseworthy change has been wrought in you has been wrought not by us, but by Him “Who alone doeth wonderful works,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_261_a" id="target_note_LCL239_261_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is no reason why we should be less eager to stir ourselves to visit you. With much more eagerness ought we to hasten to behold the works of God than our own, for we too, in so far as we are good at all, are His work, not the work of men. That, is why the Apostle says, “Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_261_b" id="target_note_LCL239_261_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<p>You mention in your letter an incident which I too<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> recall from classical literature, how by discoursing on the fruits of temperance Xenocrates suddenly converted Polemo<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_261_ca" id="target_note_LCL239_261_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> to another mode of life, though he was not only a drunkard but was actually drunk at the time. Now although he was not won for God, but was only delivered from the thraldom of self-indulgence, as you have wisely and truly apprehended, yet I would not ascribe even that change wrought in him for the better to the work of man, but to that of God, for from God alone, by Whom nature was created and made perfect, come whatever good qualities there are in the body itself, the lowest part of us, such as comeliness and strength and health and the like. How much more sure is it, therefore, that no other can bestow its good qualities upon the soul. Can human folly harbour a more arrogant or ungrateful thought than the notion that whereas God makes man beautiful in body, man makes himself pure in heart?
