public officials that the priest Victor received from his bishop, or whether, since Victor himself has denied it, they have fathered a lie upon him in the public documents, although they belong to the same religious body. Otherwise, if he agrees that we should without heat discuss the whole question at issue between us to the end that the error, which is already clear, may be more clearly brought to light, I gladly embrace the opportunity. I have heard of his proposal that without any popular uproar we should examine what is true according to the Scriptures, in the presence of ten weighty and honourable men from each side. That alternative proposal, which some reported to me as his, that I should go to Constantine,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_99_a" id="target_note_LCL239_99_a"><sup>a</sup></a> since his followers were more numerous there, or that I ought to go to Milevis,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_99_ba" id="target_note_LCL239_99_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> because there, people say, they are going to hold a council soon, it is absurd to make, as if any particular charge concerned me except the church of Hippo. The whole issue of this inquiry lies between me and Proculianus above all, but if he considers himself unequal to it, let him implore the aid of any colleague of his that he chooses. For in other towns we deal with matters concerning the Church only so far as the bishops of those towns, our brethren and fellow-priests, allow us or enjoin upon us.</p>
<p>And yet, I do not quite see what he, who proclaims<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>himself a bishop of such long standing, is afraid of in a novice such as I am, to shrink from a conference
