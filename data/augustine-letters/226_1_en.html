qualities that are worthy of being praised are thought not worth possessing unless a man is praised by his fellows, or, on the other hand, when a man desires great praise for things which are worthier of either slight praise or even censure. Hence Horace was much more cautious than Ennius in saying<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_453_a" id="target_note_LCL239_453_a"><sup>a</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">Swell you with lust for praise? Then read thrice o’er</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>You see he thought that the swelling arising from<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> the lust for human praise was to be, as it were, charmed away, like some serpent’s bite, by healing words. The Good Master has accordingly taught us by His apostle not to live right and do right with the object of being praised by men, that is, not to make the praise of men the motive of our doing right, and yet He has taught us for men’s sake to seek men’s praise.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_453_b" id="target_note_LCL239_453_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For when good men are praised, the praise confers a benefit on those who bestow it, not on those who receive it.

So the apostle says in a certain passage, “If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_453_c" id="target_note_LCL239_453_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and he says in another passage, Please all men in all things, “even as I please all men in all things<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_453_d" id="target_note_LCL239_453_d"><sup>d</sup></a>”; but he adds the reason, “Not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many that they may be saved.” See what he sought in men’s praise, of which he says further, “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are
