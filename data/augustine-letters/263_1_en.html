<p>So important is the ceremony to which your brotherly affection invites me, that I should drag my poor body to you with willingness, were it not detained by weakness. I might have come, had it not been winter; I might have scorned the winter, had I been young; for either the glow of youth would have endured the rigour of the season, or else the glow of summer would have allayed the chill of age. As it is, my saintly lord, my holy and revered brother and fellow-priest, in winter I cannot bear so lengthy a journey since I must bear with me the frigidity of great age. I return the greeting that I owe to your merits: my own welfare I commend to your supplications, while beseeching the Lord myself that peace and prosperity may follow upon the dedication of so great a building.</p>

Nobilius is not known and his name does not elsewhere appear. From internal evidence this appears to be among the last letters Augustine wrote: the remaining letter in the complete collection is from the hand of an unknown correspondent. The date of the present piece is probably the winter of 429â€“430.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_527_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
