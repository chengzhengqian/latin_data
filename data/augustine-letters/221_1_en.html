seizure he had learned the Creed and still retained it in his memory. And thus was destroyed in him all the scurrility which, as you know, was a great blemish on his natural kindness and made him, when he mocked Christians, a very sacrilegious man.

He is best remembered as the central figure in that Council of 418 which decreed that no African cleric should prosecute an appeal overseas (<span class="italic">cf</span>. p. 364 above)—a decree of great importance in the controversy about the supremacy of the see of Rome. Sicca (or Sicca Veneria, so-called from its famous temple to Astarte, whom the Romans identified with Venus) is the modern Le Kef, lying about 125 miles south-west of Tunis; its strategical position on the great roads between Numidia and Proconsular Africa gave it great importance.
Novatus was bishop of Sitifis (Sétif) in Mauretania; he was addressed by Augustine in No. 22 above. The <span class="italic">Hilarense oppidum</span> I have not succeeded in locating. One of the four manuscripts of this letter reads <span class="italic">larensi,</span> wins is probably the adjectival form of the name <span class="italic">Lares,</span> an important town 10 miles south-east of Sicca Veneria and prominent during the war with Jugurtha (Sallust, <span class="italic">Iug.</span> 90). Though at a considerable distance from Carthage, it was within Carthaginian territory, and was easy for Darius to reach from Sicca, so I am inclined to adopt the reading <span class="italic">Larensi</span> here in place of the unidentifiable <span class="italic">Hilarensi.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_443_ca').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
