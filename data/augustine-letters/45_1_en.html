daily evening service<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_91_a" id="target_note_LCL239_91_a"><sup>a</sup></a> was held and we retired with the bishop, while the brethren repeated hymns there and a considerable crowd of both sexes remained and engaged in singing until darkness fell.</p>
<p>I have set forth for you, as briefly as I could, what<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> I am sure you were anxious to hear. Pray that God will graciously protect my efforts from providing any cause of offence or any distress. In no small measure we share with lively warmth of affection in your contentment that such frequent gifts to us from the spiritually-minded church of Tagaste are intimated. The ship with the brethren has not yet arrived. At Asna,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_91_b" id="target_note_LCL239_91_b"><sup>b</sup></a> where the priest is brother Argentius, the Circumcellions<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_91_c" id="target_note_LCL239_91_c"><sup>c</sup></a> have broken into our church and smashed the altar. The case is at present being tried; we earnestly beg you to pray that the trial may give no provocation, and may serve, as becomes the Catholic Church, to check the tongue of provocative heresy. I have sent a letter to the Asiarch.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_91_d" id="target_note_LCL239_91_d"><sup>d</sup></a></p>
<p>May ye remain steadfast in the Lord, brethren, in all blessedness, and forget us not! Amen.</p>

The religious character of the office disappeared with the establishment of Christianity. The word occurs in Acts xix. 31 and in the letter of the Church of Smyrna about the martyrdom of Polycarp. Here the presence of the word is surprising, unless it be either a synonym for “pro-consul” or a proper name.
