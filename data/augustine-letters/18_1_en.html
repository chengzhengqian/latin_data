who dispenses God’s word and sacrament to the people, only now to be debarred from acquiring what I know I do not possess, are you, Father Valerius, simply decreeing my ruin? Where is your affection for me? Do you really love me? Do you really love the Church which you want me to serve with this poor equipment? Yet I am sure that you love us both, but you think me quite well equipped, though I know myself better; but I should not have acquired this knowledge, had it not been taught me by experience.</p>
<p>But perhaps your Holiness replies: “I should like<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span> to know wherein your training is deficient.” It has so many deficiencies that it would be easier for me to enumerate the things I have acquired than those I want to acquire.
