obstinacy or to praying that others may imitate their repentance. The losses that were inflicted are either being borne by Christians or are being made good by Christians. As for the gain of souls, which we long to secure even at the peril of our own body, we hope that your district will furnish an unusually precious harvest and that other districts will not be kept back by that example. May God in His mercy grant us to rejoice over your salvation!</p>

On the downfall of Stilicho the Donatists believed for a moment that persecution would end, but Olympius, Stilicho’s betrayer,
who became Master of the Offices on November 14, 408 (the “promotion” mentioned by Augustine), confirmed the anti-Donatist legislation by a rescript of November 24 addressed to the African Proconsul, whom Augustine besought
in No. 27 (Ep. c.) to exercise coercion upon the Donatists but not to impose the penalty of death. Before news of 01ympius’s confirmation had reached Africa, a deputation was sent by the African bishops to beg the Emperor to put in force the laws against disturbers of peace and religion. To secure Olympius’s support Augustine sends this letter by a priest passing through Hippo on his way from Mileum to Rome. The letter is important too because, according to Zosimus, Olympius merely used Christianity as a cloak for his evil-doing, but Augustine’s warm and appreciative language here gives quite another view of his character. If allowance must be made for Zosimus’s ill-will to all Christians, it must equally be made for Augustine’s want of personal knowledge of Olympius and the exaggeratedly deferential tone of epistolary address.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL239_171_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
