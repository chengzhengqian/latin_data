Yet if it were in our power of our own free-will to obey this precept, to understand and be wise, without the assistance of grace, it would be useless to say to God, “Give me understanding, that I may learn Thy commandments,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_415_b" id="target_note_LCL239_415_b"><sup>b</sup></a> nor would it be written in the Gospel, “Then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_415_c" id="target_note_LCL239_415_c"><sup>c</sup></a>; nor would the apostle James say, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, Who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL239_415_d" id="target_note_LCL239_415_d"><sup>d</sup></a> But the Lord is able to grant both to you and to us, to rejoice in the speedy tidings of your peace and holy concord. I greet you, not only in my own name, but also in the name of the brethren who are with me, and I beseech you to pray for us with one heart and with all instancy. The Lord be with you! Amen.</p>
