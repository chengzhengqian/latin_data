Rome? What profit is it to you that girls should sleep alone? Take it from me, either you will have horns again or else, cruel creature, we will banish you from our city: the Nile has never found favour with the Tiber.</p>
<p>But you, who through an excess of piety have caused my sufferings, when we are released from these nights, let us thrice make love’s journey.</p>
<h3><span class="italic">2.33b Cynthia holds her wine</span></h3>
<p>You hear not my words and let them fall idly on the air, though already Icarus’ oxen<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_207_84" id="target_note_LCL018_207_84">
<sup>84</sup>
</a> are turning their slow-setting stars.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_207_85" id="target_note_LCL018_207_85">
<sup>85</sup>
</a> You drink unmoved: can midnight not wear you down? Is your hand not yet tired of throwing the dice?</p>
<p>Perish the man who discovered the heady grape and spoilt good water by mixing it with wine! The farmers of Athens had good cause to slay you, Icarus: you have learned how bitter is the scent of the vine. You, too, centaur Eurytion, were undone by wine and you, too, Polyphemus, by liquor of Ismarus. Wine ruins beauty, wine spoils youth, wine oft causes a mistress to mistake her man.</p>
<p>Mercy on us! She is not a bit affected by so much drinking! Well, drink on: you are beautiful: wine harms you not at all when garlands hang over your face and dip into your cups and you read my poems with dainty voice. Let the table swim even more liberally with floods of Falernian, let it bubble more lusciously in your golden goblet.</p>
