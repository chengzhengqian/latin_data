<p>This girl now wants a fan from a proud peacock’s tail and to hold in her hands the coolness of hard crystal; at times she is minded to ask me for ivory dice and glittering trumpery from the Sacred Way. I’m damned if the expense bothers me, but it humiliates me to be the plaything of a deceitful mistress.</p>
<p>Rather my fancy is taken by her who comes forth free and unveiled, and is not inhibited by any fear of guardians; who oft treads the Sacred Way in shabby sandals; and brooks no delay, if anyone wishes to date her; she will never put you off, nor insistently demand what your frugal father will lament that you have often given her.

Therefore wonder not if I seek common women: they defame less: surely that’s reason enough!</p>
