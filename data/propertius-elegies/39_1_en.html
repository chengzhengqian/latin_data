<h3><span class="italic">2.4 The miseries of love</span></h3>
<p>Would that I be held at least within these bounds! God help me if another love come and I die in sharper agony! Even as at first the bull refuses the plough, but later, his yoke grown familiar, comes docile to the field, so in the first flush of love young men are excited and hot-headed, but then, broken in, put up thereafter with fair and foul alike. Melampus the seer endured dishonouring fetters when found guilty of stealing the cattle of Iphiclus; he was not prompted by gain, but by the beautiful Pero, who was soon to be his bride in the house of Amythaon.</p>
<p>Many transgressions must you first bewail in your mistress, oft must you ask a favour and oft depart disappointed; oft you must spoil a blameless nail with biting, and in your anger drum the ground with a perplexed foot. All for nothing was my hair drenched in perfumes, and my feet stepped slowly with measured tread.</p>
<p>In such a case no herb avails, no night of Colchian sorcery, no drug distilled by the hand of a Perimede; for of what deceitful soothsayer am I not the prey? What witch does not a dozen times interpret my dreams? In such a case the sick man needs no doctor or soft bed; it is not the climate or weather that does him harm. He is out walking, and all of a sudden his friends are astonished at his demise! Such an intractable thing is love, whatever it is held to be. For dark is the path, whereon we discern neither cause nor drawn weapon, but yet along it come ills in profusion.</p>
