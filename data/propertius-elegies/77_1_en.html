</a> night, my love, as I wandered steeped in wine with no band of slaves to guide me, a crowd of tiny boys accosted me, I know not how many, since fear prevented my counting them; some, I fancied, held torches, some arrows, and others were even getting fetters ready for me. But they were naked. One more impudent than the rest cried out: ‘Arrest him, for you know him well enough. This was the man, this the one that the angry girl set us to deal with.’ Hardly had he spoken when a noose was round my neck.</p>
<p>Hereupon another bids them push me into their midst, and yet another ‘Death to whoever does not believe us gods! This girl, though you deserve it not, has been awaiting you for hours, whilst you, stupid, were looking for a woman out of doors. When she unties the strings of her Sidonian nightcap and lifts her eyes heavy with sleep, no perfumes of Arabian spices will waft upon you but those devised by Love with his very own hands. Now spare him, brothers, now he pledges that his love is true; and, see, now we have reached the house to which we were to bring him.’</p>
