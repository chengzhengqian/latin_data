<p>now she binds the glove to her arms that rejoice in its thongs, now whirls in a circle the flying weight of the discus, and now, hoarfrost sprinkling her hair, she follows her father’s hounds over the long ridges of Taygetus: her horses’ hooves thud round the ring, she girds the sword to her snowy hips, and shields her virgin head with hollowed bronze,</p>
<p>like the warlike throng of Amazons with breasts exposed that bathe in the waters of the Thermodon; and like Castor and Pollux on the banks of the Eurotas, Pollux to be a champion at boxing, Castor in horsemanship, with whom Helen, her bosom bare, is said to have borne arms and not to have blushed with shame in front of her divine brothers.</p>
<p>Thus Spartan custom forbids lovers to hold aloof, and one may keep to his sweetheart’s side at the crossways; none need fear for her honour or keep her under lock and key, or dread the cruel revenge of a stern husband. You need no messenger: you may speak in person about your business and have not to endure the rebuff of a long delay. No Tyrian garments beguile the eyes into error, nor are you vexed by the care spent on scenting her hair.</p>
<p>But when the Roman girl walks out of doors, she is surrounded by a vast crowd, so hemmed in that not even a finger could reach her, nor can you discover who is amenable and who is deaf to entreaty: the lover has to grope his way in the dark. Ah, Rome, had you but copied Spartan laws and combats, dearer for that blessing would you be to me.</p>
