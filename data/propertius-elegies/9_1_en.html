</a>; but the words of a clinging sweetheart hold me back and her urgent pleas, given weight by frequent changes of colour.</p>
<p>All night long she shrills her passion at me, complaining that, if I desert her, there are no gods; she tells me she is no longer mine and utters those threats that an upset mistress is wont to cast at an ungrateful lover. Amid these complaints I cannot last for an hour: perish the man who can be indifferent in love!</p>
<p>Is it worth so much to me to visit learned Athens and set eyes on the ancient riches of Asia only for Cynthia to abuse me when my ship is launched and scratch her face with frantic fingers, crying that she owes my kisses only to the wind that forbade me sail and that no one is crueller than a faithless man?</p>
<p>You must attempt to surpass your uncle’s merited axes and to restore the old laws to forgetful allies. For your youth has never had time for love, but you always thought of your warring fatherland; and may Cupid never bring you torments such as mine and all the sorrows known to my tears!</p>
<p>Allow me, whom Fortune willed to lie ever prostrate, to give up my final breath to this worthlessness. Many have contentedly perished in a long love-affair; in their number may the earth cover me too. I was born unfit for glory, unfit for arms: love is the warfare fate wishes me to undergo.</p>
