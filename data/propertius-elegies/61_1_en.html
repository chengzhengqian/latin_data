the sight of lonely woods and vagabond streams issuing from mossy hills cannot relieve me of the fear that your name is ever on the lips of a persistent wooer: no one would be unwilling to take advantage of an absent lover.</p>
<h3><span class="italic">2.20 Faithful for ever</span></h3>
<p>Why do you weep more bitterly than the abducted Briseis? Why in your anxiety do you weep more sorrowfully than captive Andromache? And why do you frantically weary the gods with tales of my infidelity? Why do you complain that my loyalty has sunk so low? Not so shrilly does the mourning bird of Attica utter her nightly dirge in Athenian trees; not so does Niobe, whose pride caused twice six deaths, pour down her tears from anguished Sipylus.</p>
<p>Though my arms be bound with fetters of bronze and your limbs be confined in Danaë’s tower, for you, sweetheart, I would break the bronze chains and leap over the iron walls of Danaë’s tower. My ears are deaf to all men say about you: but you too must not doubt my earnestness. By the bones of my mother and my father I swear to you (if I lie, may the ghosts of each come back to haunt me!) that I will remain faithful to you, sweetheart, to my dying hour: a single love, a single end shall take us both away.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_159_48" id="target_note_LCL018_159_48">
