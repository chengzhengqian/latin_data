of lovers desecrated after their death. Let secluded ground cover me with leafy trees, or let me be buried where I am enclosed in an unmarked mound of sand: I like it not to have my name recorded on a highway.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_281_47" id="target_note_LCL018_281_47">

<h3><span class="italic">3.17 Homage to Bacchus</span></h3>
<p>Now, Bacchus, I humbly prostrate myself at your altar: grant me, O Father, peace and prospering sails. You can quell the gales of raging passion and in your liquor a swainâ€™s sorrows find balm. With your aid lovers meet and lovers part: do you, Bacchus, wash the mischief from my soul.</p>
<p>For you too are not without experience: to that, carried by your lynx-drawn chariot to heaven, Ariadne bears witness among the stars.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_281_48" id="target_note_LCL018_281_48">
<sup>48</sup>
</a> This evil, which has long kept a lasting fire within my bones, only death or your wine will cure. For a sober night is always torment to lovers left desolate: hope and fear keep shifting their minds this way or that.</p>
<p>But if your gifts, Bacchus, make my temples glow and you bring sleep which puts my bones to rest, then I myself will sow vines and plant the hills in rows, staying awake to see that no wild beasts crop them. Only let my vats foam with the purple must and the fresh grape stain the feet that tread it, and I shall spend what life is left me honouring you and your horns, and shall be famed, Bacchus, as the poet of your power.</p>
