show your mother. It’s not as though sagging breasts bar you from fun and games: leave that worry to her who knows the shame of having given birth. While fate permits, let us feast our eyes with love: a long night is coming for you and day will not return.</p>
<p>And would that you might so bind us with a chain as we embrace that no day might ever part us! Let doves yoked in love be your model, male and female, a perfect union. He errs who seeks to put a limit to the madness of love: true love knows no bounds. Sooner shall the land mock ploughmen with the wrong crops, sooner the Sun drive a chariot of darkness, and rivers begin to recall their waters to their source, and the deep dry up and leave its fish athirst, than I be able to transfer my love-pangs elsewhere: hers will I be in life, in death I will be hers.</p>
<p>But if she were willing now and again to allow me nights such as this, even a year would be long length of life. If she further gives me many, I will grow immortal in them: a single such night might make any man a god. If all men wished to spend a life like mine and lie with limbs weighed down with deep draughts of wine, there would be no cruel weapons or ships of war, nor would our bones be tossed on Actium’s waves, or Rome, so oft beset on every hand by her own conquests, be weary of letting loose her hair in grief. One thing at least with justice shall posterity be able to praise in me: my battles never outraged any of the gods.</p>
