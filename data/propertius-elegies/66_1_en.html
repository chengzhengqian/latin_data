one on earth that lives a harder life than the lover, and no one that, if you were wise, you would less wish to be.</p>
<p>I, whom men called happy while Envy gnashed her teeth, now scarce have entry every tenth day; nor may I lie with her at the crossways beneath a clear moon, or pass messages through a crack in her door. Yet though these things be so, I shrink to change my mistress: one day she will weep, when she realizes there is constancy in me.</p>
<p>Constant complaining has brought many into disfavour: oft has a woman been won by a man’s silence. If you have seen aught, say always that you have not! Or if aught perchance has hurt you, deny that you are hurt!</p>
<h3><span class="italic">2.23 The lover turned libertine</span></h3>
<p>I who was bent on fleeing the path of the ignorant mob now find tasteful even water taken from a public trough.</p>
<p>Does any free-born man give bribes to another’s slave to carry a message to his mistress, and ask repeatedly ‘What portico shades her now?’ and ‘In what park does she wend her steps today?’ And then, when you have endured what rumour calls the labours of Hercules, to have her write ‘Have you any present for me?’ or to win the privilege of facing a grim guardian and oft lying hidden, caught in a filthy hovel? How expensively does a night of joy come round but once in the whole year! A plague on those whom a closed door delights!</p>
