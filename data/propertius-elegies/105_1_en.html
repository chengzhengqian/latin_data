<h3><span class="italic">3.8 The lamplight brawl</span></h3>
<p>I enjoyed the lamplight brawl we had last night and all the abuse of your frenzied tongue. But I dare you: come, tear my hair and scratch my face with your pretty nails; threaten that you will light a flame and burn my eyes out, tear my tunic and strip my body bare. When, crazed with wine, you knock over the table and fling full cups at me with frenzied hand, you are without question giving me tokens of true ardour: for no woman smarts unless hers is a serious passion.</p>
<p>She whose ranting tongue spits out insults is grovelling at the feet of mighty Venus. Whether, when going out, she surrounds herself with a throng of escorts, or rushes down the street like a possessed bacchante, whether nightmares frequently scare her out of her mind or the painted portrait of a girl brings her misery, of all these mental torments I am a true interpreter; I have learned that these are often the signs of a sure love. No love is sure that cannot be provoked to a quarrel: an unfeeling girl is what I wish my enemies.</p>
<p>Let rivals see the wounds I have sustained in neck-bites: let bruises on me show that I have had my girl with me. I want either to suffer in love or hear that you are suffering, I want to see my tears or else yours whenever you send a hidden message with a twitch of your eyebrows or trace with your fingers words that cannot be spoken. Anathema to me is a sleep which is never punctuated by sighs: I should always wish to be the wan lover of an angry mistress.</p>
