<p>‘For now I was beguiling sleep by spinning crimson thread, and now in my weariness by music of Orpheus’ lyre; and sometimes, all forlorn, I softly complained to myself that in unmarried love waiting is often long: till Sleep with soothing wings overcame my exhausted body. That was my weeping’s last concern.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_49_12" id="target_note_LCL018_49_12">

<p>Why, Bassus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_49_13" id="target_note_LCL018_49_13">
<sup>13</sup>
</a> by praising so many other girls do you press me to change and forsake my mistress? Why do you not rather let me spend whatever time I have left to live in bondage I have grown used to?</p>
<p>Though your praises recall the loveliness of Antiope, Nycteus’ child, and of Spartan Hermione, and all the women the years of the age of beauty produced: Cynthia would make their glory pale. Much less, if compared with trivial beauties, need she fear the disgrace of being pronounced inferior even by a fastidious judge.</p>
<p>Yet this beauty is the least part of my frenzy; she has greater charms, Bassus, which I am glad to lose my head over: her well-bred complexion, her grace when she moves her limbs, and thrills I love to experience beneath the secrecy of the coverlet. And the more you endeavour to undo our love, the more each of us foils you through the pledge which is cherished.</p>
