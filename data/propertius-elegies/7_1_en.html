<p>You will not get away with it: my furious sweetheart will hear of this and be your foe with no unspoken words; nor hereafter will Cynthia entrust me to you or seek you out (she will not forget such a dire offence), and in her anger she will discredit you with all other girls: woe to you: no doorstep will welcome you then.</p>
<p>No altar will be too mean to receive her tears, or whatever sacred stone there is, no matter of what kind and where. No loss more keenly provokes Cynthia than when love has been stolen from her and her charms lie idle, especially when that love is mine. May she ever thus remain, I pray, and may I find nothing in her of which to complain!</p>
<p>Envious man, curb now at last your tiresome<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_51_14" id="target_note_LCL018_51_14">

</a> tongue and leave the pair of us to proceed on our way together!</p>

<p>What are you after, lunatic?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_51_15" id="target_note_LCL018_51_15">

</a> To feel my sweetheart’s fury? Wretch, you are hastening to experience the ultimate in woe, to make your luckless way through unimagined fires, and drink all Thessaly’s supply of poison.</p>
<p>She is not like flighty girls and is not to be compared with them: she will not be able to restrain her anger with you. And if by chance she does not turn a deaf ear to your prayers, yet what countless sorrows will she cause you! Soon she will not allow you to sleep or close your eyes: she is fierce and just the one to curb men with her will.</p>
