<p>How can you be so silly? You are imagining promises that are worthless: no doubt he is warming his breast with another love. You have striking beauty, you have the skills of chaste Pallas, and your learned grandsire’s glorious renown shines upon you. Blest is your house, had you only a faithful lover. I will be faithful: hasten, sweetheart, to my bed.</p>
<p>My first night of love is coming! O Moon, add time to my first night; linger long over our first union. You, too, O Sun, who draw out to excess your summer fires, cut short the journey of lingering daylight.</p>
<p>How many hours shall first give way to my wooing before Venus spurs us to her sweet warfare! First must the terms be made, the oath sealed, and the contract written for this new love of mine. Love himself with his own signet will ratify these pledges: the woven crown of Ariadne among the stars is witness.</p>
<p>For when a union is not bound by fixed terms, the lover’s sleepless nights have no gods to avenge them, and passion soon loosens the fetters of those whom it has bound: for us let the first omens guarantee lasting faith.</p>
<p>Wherefore: whoever after touching the altar shall violate these terms and pollute the rites of marriage with another union, let him suffer all the pains love knows; let him expose himself to chattering gossip; let his mistress’ window never open to him at night for all his weeping; let him ever be in love, and ever lack its enjoyment.</p>
