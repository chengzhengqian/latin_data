<p>Ah, how often will you run to my door after a rejection, when your brave words will break down in sobs; trembling and shuddering will come over you with unhappy tears, and fear will trace unsightly lines upon your face, and any words you are groping for will die on your lips as you complain, nor in your distress will you succeed in knowing who or where you are!</p>
<p>Then you will be forced to experience the harsh bondage of my sweetheart and what it means to go home when the door is shut in your face; and by that time you will not so often be surprised by my wan colour, or why my whole body is shrunk to nothing. And your high birth will not help you in love either: Love scorns to defer to ancestral portraits.</p>

Then when you ask me, I will be unable to bring you any comfort, since I have no medicine for my own malady; but, comrades in love and woe, we shall be equally compelled to weep each in turn on the otherâ€™s bosom.</p>
