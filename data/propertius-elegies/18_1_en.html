<p>Happy the man who can weep in his sweetheart’s presence (Love takes great joy in being sprinkled with tears) or, if spurned, has been able to change his passion (there is joy, too, in transferring one’s bondage).

<h3><span class="italic">1.13 Gallus going downhill</span></h3>
<p>As is your way, Gallus, you will exult in my misfortune, for my love has been stolen from me and I am left alone. But I shall not copy your language, traitor: may no girl, Gallus, ever wish to play you false.</p>

This girl will be the penalty for scorning those others’ woes: one will exact the piteous requital for many. This girl will put a stop to your promiscuous affairs, nor will you always be so eager for new conquests.</p>

I saw you languish, Gallus, your neck tightly fastened in her embrace, and with your arms about her weep a long while; I saw you desperate to breathe out your last on those longed-for lips, and then what happened, friend, my modesty conceals.</p>
