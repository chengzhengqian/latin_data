</a> return for your unwavering love, Gallus, I give you some words of warning. Let not this maxim drain away from your unthinking mind: chance oft confronts the lover when he least expects. Just so did the Ascanius prove cruel to the Argonauts.</p>
<p>Your flame resembles Hylas, son of Theodamas, not inferior in beauty, not unlike in name. Whether you sail on the river that flows through Umbria’s woods, or bathe your feet in Anio’s waters, or pace the shores of the Giants’ strand, or anywhere a river’s wandering waters welcome you, ward off from him the ever lustful hands of the Nymphs (the western Dryads are no less amorous than their sisters), lest it be your fate, Gallus, in endless quest to visit bleak hills and icy crags and pools not tried before.</p>
<p>Such woes the ill-starred wanderer Hercules endured in a foreign land when he wept by the unrelenting Ascanius. For once on a time, they say, the Argo left the dockyards of Pagasa and went on its long voyage to Phasis, and having now glided past the waves of the Hellespont brought its hull alongside the cliffs of Mysia. Here the band of heroes set foot upon the peaceful shore and covered the ground with a soft carpet of leaves. But the squire of the invincible prince ranged farther afield to seek the choice water of a sequestered spring.</p>
