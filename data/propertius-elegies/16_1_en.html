Is any room left for me in a far corner of your heart? Or has some rival by his pretended rapture stolen you, Cynthia, from your place in my songs, since, when there is none to watch her, a girl will stray and, betraying her lover, will forget the gods that sealed their troth?</p>
<p>I would rather that some toy boat, propelled by tiny paddles, be amusing you upon the Lucrine lake, or that waters yielding easily to the swimmer’s alternating strokes be keeping you cloistered in the shallow waves of Teuthras, than you be free to hear the seductive whispers of another, comfortably couched on a beach that tells no tales: not that you are not known to me as of tested repute, but because in this regard fear is felt for every love. So forgive me if my letters cause you any offence: my fear must take the blame.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_69_28" id="target_note_LCL018_69_28">
