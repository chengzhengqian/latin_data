<p>Let the bawd’s tomb be an old wine-jar with broken neck, and upon it, wild fig-tree, exert your might. All ye that love, pelt this grave with jagged stones,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_349_59" id="target_note_LCL018_349_59">

</a>: let tongues be hushed for the rites and let a calf fall smitten before my altar. Let the Roman garland rival the ivy crown of Philitas and let the pitcher pour out pure water of Callimachus. Give me soft unguents and offerings of appeasing incense, and thrice about the hearth let the woollen fillet be twined.

Like Callimachus in his <span class="italic">Hymn</span> to the god (2), the poet first appears as a priest making sacrifice; a description of the battle (15-68) forms the centrepiece; and the conclusion shows us himself with his fellow-poets celebrating the festival.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL018_349_60').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
