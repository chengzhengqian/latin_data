<p>Am I to be ashamed to live content with a single mistress? If this is a crime, it is a crime of Love’s. Let no one lay it to my door. Cynthia, be it your joy to live with me in a dewy grotto on the mossy hills. There you will see the Sisters sitting upon the rocks and singing of the sweet loves of Jove in legend, how he was inflamed by Semele and undone by Io and finally became a bird and flew to the homes of Troy. And if none has arisen to prevail over the weapons of the winged god, why am I alone accused of a universal fault?</p>
<p>Nor will you shock the modest faces of the Muses: their company also knows what it means to love, if after all it is true that one of them upon the rocks of Bistonia was once ravished by handsome Oeagrus. There, when they set you in the forefront of their dance, and Bacchus stands in the midst with his wand of song, then will I suffer the sacred ivy to be placed upon my brow: for without you my genius is naught.</p>
