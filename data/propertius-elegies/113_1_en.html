glory shattered at our feet? Curtius by filling a chasm made himself a lasting memorial; spurring his horse Decius broke the enemy’s line; the path of Cocles still tells of the cutting of the bridge, and there is the hero to whom a raven gave his name: Leucadian Apollo will tell of a host turned in flight: one day put an end to a war of such vast array.</p>
<p>But do you, sailor, whether you enter or leave harbour, remember Caesar over all the Ionian sea.</p>
<h3><span class="italic">3.12 Galla’s fidelity</span></h3>
<p>Postumus, how could you leave Galla in tears and as a soldier follow the brave standards of Augustus? Was any glory from despoiling the Parthians worth so much, when your Galla was imploring you again and again not to go? Heaven pardon me, but perish all ye together that thirst for gain, and whoever prefers arms to a faithful wife!</p>
<p>Yet you, madman, your cloak thrown over you as a hood, will drink from a helmet the water of Araxes when you are exhausted, whereas she meanwhile will waste away from empty rumours, fearing that this valour of yours may prove fatal to you, that the Parthian archer may rejoice at your death, or the mailed warrior upon his armoured steed, or that a small part of you be brought home in an urn for her to mourn: thus they return who perish in those lands.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_263_36" id="target_note_LCL018_263_36">
