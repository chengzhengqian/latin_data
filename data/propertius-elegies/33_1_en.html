</a> It is not Calliope, not Apollo that puts these songs in my mind: my sweetheart herself creates the inspiration. If I have seen her step forth dazzling in Coan silks, a whole book will emerge from the Coan garment; if I have seen the locks straying scattered on her brow, I praise her locks and for joy she walks with head held high; if with ivory fingers she strikes the melody of the lyre, I marvel how skilfully she applies her easy touch; or if she lowers eyelids that fight against sleep, the poet in me finds a thousand new conceits; or if, her dress torn off, she struggles naked with me, then, be sure of it, I compose long Iliads: whatever she has said, whatever she has done, from absolutely nothing is born a grand legend.</p>
