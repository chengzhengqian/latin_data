Then when my yacht has crossed the Ionian and rested its weary sails in the calm waters at Lechaeum, for what remains of the journey, hasten ye, my feet, to endure the toil, where the Isthmus beats back either sea from the land. Then when the shores of Piraeus’ haven receive me, I shall ascend the long arms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_293_58" id="target_note_LCL018_293_58">
