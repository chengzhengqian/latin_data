placed your arms beneath his failing chin: he could not have weighed heavy on your hands. Give up the corpse, ye waters: his life was laid down in your flood; ye worthless sands, cover Paetus as ye will; and whenever a sailor passes by Paetus’ tomb, let him say: ‘You can cause fear even to the brave.’</p>
<p>Go now, fashion curved ships and webs of destruction: his death was engineered by human hands. The land was not enough for doom, we have added the sea: our skill has extended the cruel avenues of fate.</p>
<p>Is an anchor to hold you, who were not held by your home? Say, what does he deserve, whose country suffices him not? Whatever you build is at the mercy of the winds: no ship has ever grown old, and even the harbour betrays its trust. For though all your cables are fastened to the rocks, in a night tempest, with strands frayed, they break loose. There are shores that testify to Agamemnon’s woe, shores branded by the fate of Athamantiad Argynnus. [On the loss of this youth the son of Atreus did not weigh anchor, a delay which brought about the sacrifice of Iphigenia.]</p>
<p>Nature has spread out the sea as a trap for the covetous: it scarcely happens once that a man enjoys success on it. The reefs of Caphereus shattered the fleet of the conquerors, when Greece foundered in shipwreck over the wild main. Ulysses wept at the loss of his comrades one after another, his customary cunning powerless against the sea.</p>
<p>But you, cruel North Wind, will never see my sails: before my mistress’s door must I, naught venturing, be laid.</p>
