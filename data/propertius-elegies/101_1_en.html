<p>‘Is this the reward he promised in your hearing, Lygdamus? Even with a slave for witness there is a penalty for perjury. Can he forsake me though I have done nothing to deserve it, and keep at home a creature I cannot bring myself to name? He rejoices, does he, that I waste away, alone on an empty bed? If he likes, let him jump for joy at my death, Lygdamus. That woman has triumphed not by winning ways, but by magic herbs: he is drawn by the whirligig’s threaded wheel.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_239_16" id="target_note_LCL018_239_16">

<p>‘He is lured by the sorcery of the toad puffed with venom and the bones she has gathered from the dried bodies of snakes, a screech-owl’s feathers found among sunken tombs and a woollen fillet that has decked a bier. If my dreams portend the truth, Lygdamus, I swear that he shall pay a late but ample penalty at my very feet; dusty cobwebs will be woven over his empty bed and Venus herself will sleep on their nights of love.’</p>
<p>If my sweetheart so complained in all sincerity to you then run back again, Lygdamus, by the same route, and amid much weeping convey this message: that there is anger but not betrayal in my love, that I too am roasted on a fire like hers; I will swear to having been continent these past twelve days. Then, if a happy reconciliation emerges from so great a conflict, so far as lies in my power, Lygdamus, you will be free.</p>
