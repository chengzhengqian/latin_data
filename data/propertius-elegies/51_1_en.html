<p>I am not just an admirer of comely beauty or of any woman who boasts illustrious ancestors: be it my delight to recite my verses in the lap of a scholar girl and have them approved by the pure taste of her ear. When such a success falls to my lot, then good-bye to the confused babble of the people: for I shall be secure in the judgement of my sweetheart. If only she turns on me a kindly ear and grants a truce, then I can endure Jove’s enmity . . .</p>
<p>So, whenever death shall close my eyes, let me tell the arrangements you are to observe at my funeral. On that day let my cortege not march with a long line of masks,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_139_34" id="target_note_LCL018_139_34">

</a> no trumpet be the vain lament of my death; on that day let no bier be spread for me on ivory posts, nor my corpse rest on a couch of cloth-of-gold. Be absent a line of perfumed dishes; be present the humble rites of a common burial.</p>
<p>Enough, yes grand enough,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_139_35" id="target_note_LCL018_139_35">

</a> rolls of verse for me to present to Persephone as my most precious gift. But you must follow with your bare breast torn, and not tire of calling on my name and press the final kisses on my frozen lips when the casket filled with Syrian offerings is bestowed.</p>
<p>Then, when the fire beneath has turned me into ash, let a little jar receive my ghost, and above, over a tiny tomb, let a laurel be planted to cast its shade over the site of the burned-out pyre, and add a line or so to say ‘Who now is buried here as gruesome dust, once was the slave of a single love.’</p>
