<p>the toga, I am a man? Give me a scythe and bind my forehead with a wisp of hay: you will swear that my hand has cut grass.</p>
<p>I once bore arms and, as I recall, was praised therein: with a heavy basket on my back I was a reaper. Sober am I when dressed for court; but with a garland on my brows you will declare the wine has gone to my head. Bind my head with a turban, I will steal the semblance of Bacchus; and, given only his lyre, I will steal that of Phoebus. With a whip in my hand I also present the guise of a charioteer and of him who switches his nimble body from horse to horse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_325_26" id="target_note_LCL018_325_26">

<p>With nets on my shoulder I hunt: but carrying a fowler’s reed I am the patron god of the hunt for feathered prey. Wearing a felt-hat I shall catch fish with a rod, and in trailing garb I will step abroad as a spruce pedlar. I can bend myself to the crook as a shepherd, and can as well carry roses in baskets amid the dust.</p>
<p>Need I add, wherein lies my chief renown, that my hands are filled with the garden’s choicest fruit? It is for me that the first grape darkens on the purpling cluster, and the spiky corn-ear swells with milky grain; at my feet you see sweet cherries, at my feet autumn plums and the mulberry blushing in the summertime; here the grafter pays his vows with a garland of fruit, when the pear’s reluctant stock has borne him apples.</p>

H. Griffiths) is right in deleting this couplet, which interrupts the hunting sequence. I have retained it transposed despite the emendation entailed, as there was no obvious reason for its interpolation.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL018_325_26').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
