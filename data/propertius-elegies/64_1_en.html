<p>Do you ask, Demophoon, why I am so susceptible to them all? Love knows not the meaning of your question ‘Why?’ Why does a man gash his arms with ritual blades and maim himself at the mad rhythms of the Phrygian piper? To every one at birth nature has allotted some fault: to me fortune allotted the fault of ever having some object for my love. Though the fate of Thamyras the singer befall me, never, my envious friend, shall I be blind to a pretty face.</p>
<p>But if you think my limbs are shrunk and thin, you err: the worship of Venus has never been hard work for me. You may put the question: often a girl has discovered that I can do my duty all night through, and if perchance with an unkind look she called a halt, cold sweat would run all down my brow.</p>
<p>For Alcmena’s sake Jupiter put the twin Bears to rest, and for a doubled night did heaven lack a king; yet he was not therefore faint when he turned to wield the thunderbolt: never does the act of love rob a lover of his strength. Say, when Achilles came from Briseis’ embrace, did the Trojans flee the less from the Thessalian’s shafts? And when fierce Hector rose from Andromache’s bed, did not Mycenae’s fleet tremble before his onset? They had the power to destroy either ships or walls; in love I will be Achilles, in love fierce Hector.</p>
<p>See how now the Sun and now the Moon serve heaven: so too for me one girl is not enough. Let a second girl hold and cherish me in passionate embrace, whenever the first withholds her favour; or if perchance she brings no pleasure </p></section><notes></notes></section>
