of the times. While I thus complain, I am forced to more bitter lament, distressed by the long vigil of a certain suppliant. He never allows my portals any respite, as with artful blandishment he repeats his serenade:</p>
<p>‘O door, far crueller even than your mistress herself, why are you silent with your rigid panels shut tight against me? Why are you never unbolted to admit my love, incapable of being stirred and passing on my stealthy prayers? Shall no end be granted to my sufferings, and mine be a shameful sleep on a doorstep scarcely warm? For me, as I lie prostrate, grieve the midnight hours, for me the stars as they set, and for me the chill breeze that comes with the frosty dawn.</p>
<p>‘O that a word of mine might pass through an open crack, and reach and strike upon my sweetheart’s ears! Though she be more impassive even than Sicilian lava, though she be harder even than iron or steel, yet she will not be able to control her eyes, and sobs will arise amid involuntary tears. Now she lies cradled in the happy arms of another, while my words fall unheeded on the night wind.</p>
<p>‘But you the only, you the supreme cause of my sorrow, O door, never won over by my gifts, you only never take pity on human sorrows and, your hinges silent, never make sympathetic answer. No outburst of my tongue has injured you. What awful remarks is it wont to utter in bitter jest that you should suffer me, hoarse with lengthy complaints, to spend long vigils in torment at the street corner?</p>
