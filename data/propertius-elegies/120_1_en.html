Antiope appeal? Unaided though, summoning all the strength in her body, she burst the gyves the queen had put upon her hands. Then with trembling feet she runs to the heights of Cithaeron. It was night, and her couch was harsh with scattered frost.</p>
<p>Oft, scared by the sound of Asopusâ€™ restless current, she thought that the feet of her mistress were following behind. Her tears found Zethus unmoved, Amphion inclined to pity, when she, their mother, was driven from a steading that was of right her own. And just as, when the seas abate their mighty motions and the East Wind ceases to battle with the South, along the buffeted shore the howling of the sand dies down, so did the poor woman, sinking, bow her knee and fall.</p>
<p>Late, but yet filial duty showed: the sons perceived their fault. You, old man, fit guardian of the sons of Jove, restore the mother to her boys; and the boys bound Dirce to be dragged beneath the head of a fierce bull.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL018_277_46" id="target_note_LCL018_277_46">

</a> Antiope, recognize the hand of Jove: for your satisfaction Dirce is drawn along to find death in many a spot. The fields of Zethus are red with blood, and Amphion sang the paean of victory on your rocks, O Aracynthus.</p>
<p>But you must stop tormenting innocent Lycinna: the impetuous anger of you women knows no drawing back. No gossip about me is to alarm your ears: even when consumed by the funeral pyre I can love only you.</p>
