<p>I. What Marcus Scaurus, gentlemen of the jury,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> might most have prayed for was to retain, as he has ever been most anxious to do, the dignity of his race, his family, his reputation, without incurring the hatred of any or being the source of any offence or annoyance.
