And in truth you will assuredly find no other reason to justify a voluntary death. This the prosecutor realized; for he dropped a hint somewhere that that woman preferred to be despoiled of her life rather than of her chastity; but he straightway abandoned<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> the subject, and said no more on the theme of chastity, fearing, no doubt, to provide us with a handle for jest and mockery; for it is notorious that her ugliness was as extreme as her old age.

So in agreement with Bostar’s mother he planned that they should both come to Rome; and he promised that there he would discover some means of making her his wife.</p>
