<p>VI. There were, as I have pointed out, two impressions<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> current—one of them not out of keeping with the circumstances and nature of the case—that the wife of Aris, stung with resentment at her husband’s infidelity, when she heard that Aris, pretending to have fled for fear of herself, had gone off to Rome with his light-o’-love, intending to convert their previous irregular union into formal wedlock, now betrayed all the anguish of the outraged female, and had preferred to die rather than tolerate it. The other was not less probable and, as I believe,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> even more generally held in Sardinia; it was to the effect that Aris, your witness and host, Triarius, had on his departure for Rome commissioned a freedman not indeed to use violence to the poor old lady—such conduct towards his mistress would have been irregular!—but just to press her neck with two fingers and to fasten a bit of cord round it, so that it might be supposed that she had met her death by hanging. This suspicion carried all the greater<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> weight, because the season at which the freedman alleged she had hanged herself was the time when the people of Nora were holding their festival of the Dead<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_277_a" id="target_note_LCL252_277_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and had all, after their due custom, left the city. Such departure and the resulting solitude was just what a man who intended to throttle his mistress would look for, but not so a woman who wished
to die. But the suspicion received confirmation<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> from the fact that on the old woman’s death the freedman immediately started for Rome as if his commission were executed; while Aris, as soon as the freedman had brought him news of his wife’s death, forthwith married Bostar’s mother at Rome.</p>
