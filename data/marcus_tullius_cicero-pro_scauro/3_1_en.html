<p>I swear, gentlemen, that even were I speaking on<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> behalf of Lucius Tubulus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_271_a" id="target_note_LCL252_271_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who is reported to have been quite the most wicked and unscrupulous character in history, none the less, supposing he were said to have poisoned some guest or friend during dinner, though he was not his heir and had no quarrel with him, I should not expect anybody to believe it. . . .</p>
<p>I pass now to the charge of incontinence and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> unbridled lust, with which the prosecutor has endeavoured to brand Scaurus and his reputation. We are told that Aris, not desiring to surrender his wife, with whom my client was in love, to his burning lust and unrestrained concupiscence, attempted to escape secretly from Sardinia. He left his wife in the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span> country, that is to say, and sought to secure his own safety by flight, just as beavers, so we are told, ransom themselves from the hunters by that part of their body on account of which they are chiefly hunted. . . .<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_271_b" id="target_note_LCL252_271_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>

<p>III. This, gentlemen, is, I assert, the state of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1</span><span class="br"></span> the case. My argument is not a new one; it has been discussed by others; but its truth can be substantiated by examples. . . . Those are instances of which we have been told, but this we remember and have all but seen—how Publius Crassus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL252_271_ca" id="target_note_LCL252_271_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> of the same lineage and name destroyed himself that he might not fall into the hands of his enemies. . . .</p>

The two Crassi mentioned below (illius C. superioris . . . alterum C.) are not easy to identify. I translate Asconius’s comment on “alterum C.”: “This
‘other Crassus’ is the same of whom we have spoken above [<span class="italic">i.e.</span> the C. first mentioned]. He calls him’ the other’ because he has already made mention of the P.
