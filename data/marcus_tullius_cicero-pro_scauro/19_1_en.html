of Vesta bids you remember that Lucius Metellus, who, as Pontifex Maximus, when the temple was ablaze, hurled himself into the thickest of the fire and snatched from the flames that Palladium which is the earnest of our well-being and our empire, and which lies in the safe keeping of Vesta. Would that he could be among us again but for a moment! Then assuredly, as he snatched from those fires of old the heaven-sent pledge of our security, so from these flames would he snatch his descendant. . . .</p>

<p>XXIV. But as for you, Marcus Scaurus, I see you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">49</span><span class="br"></span> with my eyes, not merely think upon you, nor is it without great grief and sorrow of mind that I call you to memory, when I look upon your sonâ€™s disarray. And would that, even as the image of you has haunted my vision throughout this whole trial, you might so confront the thoughts of these gentlemen and cleave fast within their minds. I swear that the aspect [of such a man, whose peer we have never seen in wisdom, dignity, resolution, and all other virtues, if he could but live again, would move you all so deeply that whoever looked upon him], even had he perchance never known him, would yet assert him to be a man of light and leading in our state.</p>

Nay, you are in full physical vigour, you are present to the minds and visible to the eyes of all; and your divine mind had nothing in it that was mortal, nor could anything that was yours die, save your body. In whatever terms, therefore, it be right that I address you, stand at our side . . .</p>
