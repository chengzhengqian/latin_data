<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">epi</span></span> Who says that, please? That one the same as me?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> The very man, the one the same as you. Then that old
man the same as me says, “if you wish, do give me four,
so long as you provide them with enough to eat, so that
they won’t gobble up my food.”</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">epi</span></span> Since he said this, it’s obvious that that old man was a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">555</span><span class="br"></span>
miser, as he even asked for food from the man who made
him the promise.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> No, it’s obvious that that young man was a good-for-
nothing,
since he immediately said he wouldn’t
give a
grain of wheat when that man made the request. Seriously,
since that old man had given a dowry to his daughter,
he demanded only what’s fair, to receive one for the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">560</span><span class="br"></span>
flute girl.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">epi</span></span> Really, that young man was certainly cunningly clever,
since he didn’t
want to give that old man a concubine
with a dowry.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> Well, the old man wanted to gain his point about the
food, if he could; as he couldn’t,
he said he wanted it to
be done on any terms allowed. “Yes,” said that young<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">565</span><span class="br"></span>
man. “That’s kind of you,” said the old one. “Have I got
it settled?” he said. “I’ll act the way you want it done,”
said the other. (<span class="italic">after a pause</span>) But I’ll go in and congratulate
my daughters on your arrival. Then I’ll go to
the bathtub to wash; there I’ll soothe my old age. Then,
when I’ve washed, I’ll wait for you at my leisure and
reclining at table.</p></div>
