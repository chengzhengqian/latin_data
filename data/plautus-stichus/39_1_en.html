<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">sti</span></span> This is done stupidly and idiotically in my opinion: when
people expect someone, they tend to keep watch for him;
yet he doesn’t
come any faster on that account. I’m now
doing the same; I’m keeping watch for Sangarinus, who<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">645</span><span class="br"></span>
still won’t come any faster for this reason. Soon I’ll recline
at table alone, if he doesn’t
come here. I’ll just bring
the jar with wine over from my place, then I’ll recline.
The day is melting away like snow.</p></div>

land of my master, I see you with pleasure.
But I’m worried
how my girlfriend and fellow-slave
Stephanium is
doing and how she’s faring; I’d charged Stichus to give
her my greetings and to tell her that I was going to come
today, so that she might cook dinner in good time.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">655</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">sti</span></span> Master, you did a delightful deed when you presented
your slave Stichus with this gift. Immortal gods! How
many joys I’m carrying, how much laughter, how many
jokes, how many kisses, dances, allurements, and acts of
kindness!</p></div>
