<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">gel</span></span> But here there are many crooked meddlers, who meddle
in other people’s business with greatest enthusiasm, and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">200</span><span class="br"></span>
who don’t
have anything of their own to meddle with.
When they know that someone’s going to hold an auction,
they instantly approach him and ask what the reason
is: whether debt is forcing him to or whether he has
bought land, or whether he has to return his wife’s dowry
to her because of a divorce. Even if I judge that they all<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">205</span><span class="br"></span>
deserve to be very wretched and to suffer,
I don’t
care:
I’ll state the reason for the auction so that they may be
happy about my loss; there’s no meddler who isn’t
malevolent.

very many drinking sessions have died. What’s more,
how many dinners are there whose death I’ve grieved
