<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pin</span></span> I will. After you sent me to the harbor at first light, the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">365</span><span class="br"></span>
sun, all resplendent, was just then rising from the sea.
While I was asking the customs officers
if any ship had
come from Asia and they were saying that none had
come, I spotted the biggest chipper that I think I’ve ever
seen. It enters the harbor with a favorable wind, full sail.
We ask one another: “Whose ship is it? What is it carrying?”<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">370</span><span class="br"></span>
Meanwhile I spot Epignomus, your husband, and
his slave Stichus.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pan</span></span> Oh! What? Did you say Epignomus?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pin</span></span> Yes, your husband.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">gel</span></span> And my livelihood.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pin</span></span>  (<span class="italic">ignoring Gelasimus</span>) He’s come, I’m telling you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pan</span></span> Did you see him face to face?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pin</span></span> Yes, with pleasure.
He’s brought a great deal of silver and
gold.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">gel</span></span> Excellent! Really, I’ll take the broom and sweep this up<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">375</span><span class="br"></span>
with pleasure.
(<span class="italic">starts cleaning again</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pin</span></span> A lot of wool and purple cloth.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">gel</span></span> I have something
to clothe my belly with.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pin</span></span> Couches adorned with ivory and gold.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">gel</span></span> I’ll recline at table like a king.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pin</span></span> Next, he’s brought Babylonian tapestries and draperies,
smooth fabrics and rugs, terribly good.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">gel</span></span> How successful he’s been!</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pin</span></span> Then, as I began to say, he’s brought along lyre girls, flute<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">380</span><span class="br"></span>
girls, and harp girls of outstanding beauty.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">gel</span></span> Hurray! When I’ve drunk freely, I’ll frolic; then I’m funniest.</p></div>
