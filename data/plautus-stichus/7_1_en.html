my house is spick and span when I return home. I’ll be
home soon; I’m just going round to see my elder daughter.
If anyone is looking for me, some of you must call
me from there; at any rate I’ll be back soon. (<span class="italic">begins to

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphila</span></span> What are we to do, my sister, if our father decides
not to give in to us?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pan</span></span> We ought to accept what is done by the man who has
more authority. I think we should make an effort to entreat<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">70</span><span class="br"></span>
and not to oppose him. If we seek it in a friendly
manner, I hope that we shall achieve it from him. We
cannot oppose him without very great disgrace and wickedness;
I for one am not going to do it and I won’t advise
you to do it, but rather, we should entreat him. I know
our men: he’s capable of being won over by entreaty.

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> (<span class="italic">to himself</span>) I’m considering the beginning, how I should<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">75</span><span class="br"></span>
start with them: should I vex them with my speech obscurely
like this, as if I were never accusing them at all,
or as if I’d heard something,
that they’d become guilty;
in other words, had I better handle them gently
or
threateningly? I know there will be arguments—I know
my girls perfectly—if they prefer staying here to getting<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span>
married to different men. I won’t do it. What’s the use
of waging war with my girls now that I’ve reached the
end of the course of my life, when I don’t
think they’ve
done anything for which they deserve my doing this? No,
