<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphili</span></span> But at my place the day after tomorrow; he’d already
invited me yesterday for today. But have I made
peace with you sufficiently,
Antipho?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> Since you two conducted your business the way you and
your friends ought to wish, I have peace and friendly
relations with you; do think about this: each man has<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">520</span><span class="br"></span>
friends just as he has possessions at hand. If his possessions
are stable, his friends are stable, too; if his possessions
waver wildly, his friends begin to waver, too. Possessions
find friends.</p></div>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">epi</span></span> (<span class="italic">into the house</span>) I’ll be back directly. (<span class="italic">to the audience</span>) It’s
an enormous joy if after your long absence from home
and after your return home no sorrow reaches your
heart: my wife looked after my affairs in such a way in<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">525</span><span class="br"></span>
my absence that she made me free and empty of all
sorrows.
But look, my brother Pamphilippus is walking
along with his father-in-
law.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphili</span></span> How are you, Epignomus?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">epi</span></span> And how are you? How long ago did you come into harbor?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphili</span></span> Not long at all after you.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">epi</span></span> Is that chap calm toward you now? (<span class="italic">points to Antipho</span>)</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> More so than the sea you both traveled on.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">530</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">epi</span></span> (<span class="italic">to Antipho</span>) You’re always the same. (<span class="italic">to Pamphilippus</span>)
Should we unload the ship today, my brother?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphili</span></span> Gently,
please. Rather, let’s load ourselves up with
pleasures
for a change. How soon is dinner cooked? I
haven’t
had lunch.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">epi</span></span> Go in to my place and have a bath.</p></div>
