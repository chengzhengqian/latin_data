I don’t
know any less reliable animal. Did I seek omens<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">500</span><span class="br"></span>
in a matter of life and death for me through an animal
that changes its place ten times a day? I’m resolved to
assemble my friends in order to consult them on which
terms now I . . . ought to starve.</p></div>

hadn’t
told me that you’re going to dine at his place today,
when he was inviting me to his place to dinner. And
it would have been more appropriate for me to give you

but I wouldn’t

no desire to get your goodwill through mere words: tomorrow<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">515</span><span class="br"></span>
both you and he will be at my place together
with your wives.</p></div>
