<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphila</span></span> When they’re walking through town, they should
close everybody’s
mouth, so that no one may slander
them deservedly.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> (<span class="italic">to Panegyris</span>) Now you must tell me in turn.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">115</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pan</span></span> What do you want me to tell you, father?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> How can one most easily spot a woman who is good-natured?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pan</span></span> If a woman has the opportunity to act badly and refrains
from acting so.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> Not bad, that! Come on, you other one, which match is
preferable, having a virgin or a widow?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphila</span></span> In my experience, the evil that’s the least among<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">120</span><span class="br"></span>
the many is evil to the smallest degree.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> How can a woman steer clear of faults?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphila</span></span> Every
day she should be on her guard not to do
anything the day before that she would regret the next
day.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> (<span class="italic">to Panegyris</span>) What woman seems by far the wisest to
you?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pan</span></span> The one who’ll still be able to know herself during prosperity,
and the one who bears it calmly when she’s in a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">125</span><span class="br"></span>
worse situation than she was.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> I’ve tested you two and the nature of your nature delightfully.
But this is the reason why I’m coming to you and
why I want to meet you both: my friends advise me to
take you home, away from here.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphila</span></span> But we, whose situation is at stake, advise you differently:
either we ought not to have been given in marriage<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">130</span><span class="br"></span>
to the men back then, if you didn’t
like them, or
else it isn’t
right for us to be taken away now in their
absence, father.</p></div>
