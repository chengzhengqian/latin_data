<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> Am I to bear it that you two are married to beggars while
I’m alive?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphila</span></span> I like that beggar of mine: a queen likes her king.
I have the same attitude in poverty as I once had in
wealth.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> Do you two have a high opinion of mercenaries and beggars?<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">135</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphila</span></span> You didn’t
give me in marriage to money, I think,
but to a man.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">a<span class="sc">nt</span></span> Why are you still waiting for them when they’ve already
been away for three years? Why won’t you accept a first-
rate
match instead of an utterly wretched one?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pan</span></span> Father, it’s stupidity to take dogs hunting against their
will. A wife who is given in marriage to a man against her<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">140</span><span class="br"></span>
will is his enemy.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker">ant<span class="sc"></span></span> Is it your decision that neither of you will follow her father’s
command?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pan</span></span> We are following it, because we don’t
want to leave the
men you gave us in marriage to.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> Goodbye. I’ll go and tell my friends your plans.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pan</span></span> I believe they’ll consider us more honorable, if they are
honorable themselves.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">ant</span></span> Then look after the household affairs as best you can.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">145</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pan</span></span>  Now that you’re making rightful suggestions, we approve;
now we’ll obey you.</p></div>
<span class="stage"><span class="italic">Exit <span class="sc">antipho</span> to the right.</span></span>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pan</span></span> Now let’s go inside, my sister.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphila</span></span> No, I’ll go and check on my home. If by chance
a message comes
to you from your husband, let me
know.</p></div>
