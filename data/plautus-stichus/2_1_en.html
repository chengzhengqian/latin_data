<span class="label">PLOT SUMMARY 2</span>
<p>An old man reproaches his daughters because they persist so
firmly in supporting and not leaving their husbands, impoverished
brothers traveling abroad; and yet he is softened up by
agreeable words so that he lets them keep the husbands that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
they have once acquired. The husbands return, enriched with
wealth on the other side of the sea. Each retains his wife and
Stichus is given the opportunity to have fun.</p>
