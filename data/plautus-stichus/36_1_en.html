tired?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphili</span></span> What do you think I should do?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">gel</span></span> Won’t you have a dinner cooked at home and your regrets
sent to your host’s house?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphili</span></span> Will I dine at home alone?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">gel</span></span> No, not alone: invite me.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">600</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">pamphili</span></span> But I’m afraid that the man who has spent money

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">gel</span></span> (<span class="italic">to Epignomus</span>) Won’t you go away from here? Unless
you think I don’t
see through what you’re up to. (<span class="italic">to Pamphilippus</span>)
Do watch out for yourself: that fellow is gaping 605
at your inheritance like a hungry wolf. Don’t
you
know how . . . people are murdered here in the street at
night?</p></div>
