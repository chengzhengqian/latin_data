thus conditioned; for he ate and drank and
discharged the function of the human body. For we must not think that there was
such great need in Adam that unless he had eaten he could not have lived, but,

Paradise he satisfied a need.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_129_a" id="target_note_LCL074_129_a"><sup>a</sup></a> And all know that in Christ the same need dwelt,
but lying in his own power and not laid upon him. And this need was in him
before the Resurrection, but after the Resurrection he was such that his human
body was changed as Adamâ€™s could have been changed but for the bond
of his transgression. Which, moreover, our Lord Jesus Christ himself taught us
to desire in our prayers, asking that his will be done as in heaven so on earth,
and that his Kingdom come, and that he may deliver us from evil. For that most

matter if I have said aught amiss, I am not so well pleased with myself as to
try to press what I have once blurted out in the face of wiser judgement. For if
nothing good comes from us there is nothing we should fancy in our opinions. But
if all things are good that come from him who alone is good, that rather must be
thought good which that unchangeable good and cause of all things indites.</p>
