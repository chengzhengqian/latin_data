under”—ὑποστάσεις, and since they also term the same
substances πρόσωπα, we too can call them persons. So οὐσία is identical with
essence, οὐσίωσις with subsistence, ὑπόστασις with substance, πρόσωπον with
person. But the reason why the Greek does not use ὑπόστασις of irrational
animals while we predicate the term substance of them is this: this term has
been applied to things of higher value, in order that in some way what is more
excellent might be distinguished, if not by a description of nature answering to
the literal meaning of ὑϕίστασθαι = <span class="italic">substare</span>, at any rate
by the words ὑπόστασις and <span class="italic">substantia</span>.</p>
<p>To begin with, then, man has essence, <span class="italic">i.e</span>. οὐσία,
subsistence, <span class="italic">i.e</span>. οὐσίωσις, ὑπόστασις <span class="italic">i.e</span>. substance, and πρόσωπον, <span class="italic">i.e</span>. person:
οὐσία or <span class="italic">essentia</span> because he exists, οὐσίωσις or
subsistence because he is not in any subject, ὑπόστασις or substance because he
is subject to the other things which are not subsistences or οὐσιώσεις, while he
is πρόσωπον or person because he is a rational individual. Next, God is οὐσία or
essence, for he is and is especially that from which proceeds the being of all
things. He is οὐσίωσις, <span class="italic">i.e</span>. subsistence, for he subsists
in absolute independence; and ὑϕίστασθαι, for he is substance. Whence we go on
to say that there is one οὐσία or οὐσίωσις, <span class="italic">i.e</span>. one
essence or subsistence of the Godhead, but three ὑποστάσεις, that is three
substances. And indeed, following this use, men have spoken of One essence of
the Trinity, three substances and three persons. For did not the language of the
Church forbid us to say that there are three substances in God,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_91_a" id="target_note_LCL074_91_a"><sup>a</sup></a> substance might
seem for this reason to be predicated of God,
