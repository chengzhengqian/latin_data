third
condition is that after sin, in which man needs must be pursued by death and sin
and the sinful will. Now the points of extreme divergence between these
conditions are the following: that condition which would have been a reward if
Adam had chosen to abide in God’s laws; and that which was his
punishment because he would not abide in them; for in the former there would
have been no death nor sin nor any will to sin, in the latter there was death
and sin and every desire to transgress, and a general tendency to ruin and a
condition helpless to render possible a rise after the Fall. But that middle
condition from which actual death or sin was absent, but the power for both
remained, is situate between the other two.</p>
<p>Each one, then, of these three conditions somehow supplied to Christ a cause for
his corporeal nature; thus his assumption of a mortal body in order to drive
death far from the human race belongs properly to that condition which was laid
on man by way of punishment after Adam’s transgression, whereas the
fact that there was in Christ no will to sin is borrowed from that condition
which might have been if Adam had not surrendered his will to the frauds of the
tempter. There remains, then, the third or middle condition, to wit, that which
existed at that time when death had not come and while the will to sin could yet
be present. In this condition, therefore, Adam was such that he ate and drank,
digested the food he took, fell asleep, and performed all the other functions
which always belonged to him as man, though they were allowed and brought with
them no penalty of death.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Christ was in all points
