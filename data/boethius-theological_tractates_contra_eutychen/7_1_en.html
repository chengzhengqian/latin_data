<p>Now from all this it is clear that person cannot be predicated of bodies which
have no life (for no one ever says that a stone has a person), nor yet of living
things which lack sense (for neither is there any person of a tree), nor finally
of that which is bereft of mind and reason (for there is no person of a horse or
ox or any other of the animals which dumb and without reason live a life of
sense alone), but we say there is a person of a man, of God, of an angel. Again,
some substances are universal, others are particular. Universals are those which
are predicated of individuals, as man, animal, stone, plank and other things of
this kind which are either genera or species; for man is predicated of
individual men just as animal is of individual animals, and stone and plank of
individual stones and planks. But particulars are those which are never
predicated of other things, as Cicero, Plato, this stone from which this statue
of Achilles was hewn, this plank out of which this table was made. But in all
these things person cannot anywhere be predicated of universals, but only of
particulars and individuals; for there is no person of man as animal or a genus;
only of Cicero, Plato, or other single individuals are single persons named.</p>

<p>Wherefore if person belongs to substances alone, and these rational, and if every
substance is a nature, and exists not in universals but in individuals, we have
found the definition of person: “The individual substance of a
rational nature.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_85_aa" id="target_note_LCL074_85_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> Now by this definition we Latins have described
