qualities. For the nature of no incorporeal
substance rests upon a material basis; but there is no body that has not matter
as a substrate. Since this is so, and since not even those things which
naturally have a common matter pass over into each other, unless they have the
power of acting on each other and being acted upon by each other, far more will
those things not suffer interchange which not only have no common matter but are
different in substance, since one of them, being body, rests on a basis of
matter, while the other, being incorporeal, cannot possibly stand in need of a
material substrate.</p>
<p>It is therefore impossible for a body to be changed into an incorporeal species,
nor is it ever possible for incorporeals to be changed into each other by some
process of mingling. For things which have no common matter cannot be changed
and converted one into another. But incorporeal things have no matter; they will
never, therefore, be able to be changed about among themselves. But the soul and
God are rightly believed to be incorporeal substances; therefore the human soul
has not been changed into the divinity by which is was assumed. But if neither
body nor soul could be turned into divinity, it could not possibly happen that
humanity should be transformed into God. But it is much less credible that the
two should be confounded together since neither can incorporality pass over to
body, nor again, contrariwise, can body pass over into incorporality, when these
have no common material substrate to be converted by the qualities of one or
other of the two substances.</p>

natures, meaning, no
