thought it followed that the nature should be
regarded as single. Thus Nestorius, rightly holding nature to be double in
Christ, sacrilegiously professes the persons to be two; whereas Eutyches,
rightly believing the person to be single, impiously believes that the nature
also is single. And being confuted by the plain evidence of facts, since it is
clear that the nature of man is one thing, that of God another, he declares his
belief to be: two natures in Christ before the union and only one after the
union. Now this statement does not express clearly what he means. However, let
us scrutinize his folly. It is plain that this union took place either at the
moment of begetting or that of resurrection. But if it happened at the moment of
begetting, Eutyches seems to think that even before that He was human flesh, not
taken from Mary but prepared in some other way, while the Virgin Mary was
brought in to give birth to flesh that had not been taken from her; that this
flesh, which already existed, was apart and separate from the substance of
divinity, but that when he was born of the Virgin he was united to God, so that
it seemed that one nature was made. Or if that is not his opinion, it could be
this, if he says that there were two natures before the union and one after,
supposing the union to be effected by begetting so that the body indeed he took
from Mary but before he took it the natures of Godhead and humanity were
different: but the nature assumed became one with that of Godhead into the
substance of which it passed. But if he thinks that this union was effected not
by begetting but resurrection, again he will believe this to happen in two ways;
either Christ was born but did <span class="italic">not</span> assume a body from
Mary
