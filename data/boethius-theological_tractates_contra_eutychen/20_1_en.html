stone nor indeed can the same bronze be changed into
grass, and generally no body can be transformed into any other body unless the
things which pass into each other have a common matter and can act upon and be
acted on by each other, as when wine and water are mingled both are of such a
nature as to allow reciprocal action and influence. For the quality of water can
be influenced in some degree by that of wine, similarly the quality of wine can
be influenced by that of water. And therefore if there be a great deal of water
but very little wine, they are not said to be mingled, but the one is brought to
nothing by the quality of the other. For if anyone pours wine into the sea the
wine is not mingled with the sea but is brought to nothing in the sea, simply
because the quality of the water owing to its bulk has been in no way effected
by the quality of the wine, but rather by its own bulk has changed the quality
of the wine into water. But if the natures which are capable of reciprocal
action and influence are in moderate proportion and equal or only slightly
unequal, they are really mingled and form a mixture with the qualities which are
in moderate relation to each other. This indeed takes place in bodies but not in
all bodies, but only in those, as has been said, which are capable of reciprocal
action and influence, having the same common material substrate. For every body
which subsists in conditions of birth and decay seems to possess a common
matter, but every body is not capable of reciprocal action and influence on and
by every other. But bodies will not be able in any way to be changed into
incorporeals because they do not share in any common material substrate which
might be changed into this or that thing by taking on its
