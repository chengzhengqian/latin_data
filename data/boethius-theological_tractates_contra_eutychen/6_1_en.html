<p>But the proper definition of person is a matter of very great perplexity. For if
every nature has person, the difference between nature and person is a hard knot
to unravel; or if person is not taken as the equivalent of nature but is a term
of less scope and range, it is difficult to say to what natures it may be
extended, that is, to what natures the term person may be applied and what
natures are dissociate from it. For one thing is clear, namely that nature is a
substrate of person, and that person cannot be predicated apart from nature.</p>
<p>We must, therefore, conduct our inquiry into these points as follows.</p>
<p>Since person cannot exist apart from nature and since natures are either
substances or accidents and we see that person cannot consist in accidents (for
who can say there is any person of whiteness or blackness or size?), it
therefore remains that person is properly predicated of substances. But of
substances, some are corporeal and others incorporeal. And of corporeals, some
are living and others not; of living substances, some are sensitive and others
not; of sensitive substances, some are rational and others irrational.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_83_a" id="target_note_LCL074_83_a"><sup>a</sup></a>
Similarly of incorporeal substances, some are rational, others not (for instance
the animating spirits of beasts); but of rational substances one is immutable
and impassible by nature, as God, another which in virtue of its creation is
mutable and passible unless by the grace of the impassible substance it be
transformed to the unshaken impassibility which belongs to angels and to the
soul.</p>
