translated into humanity, that has happened which piety forbids us to believe,
viz. while the humanity continued in unchangeable substance divinity was

while that which we believe to be by nature immutable and impassible was changed
into a mutable thing. But it accords with no reasoning that this should happen.
But perchance the human nature may seem to have been changed into Godhead. Yet
how can this be if divinity in Christâ€™s begetting received both human
soul and body? Things cannot be promiscuously changed and interchanged. For
since some substances are corporeal and others incorporeal, neither can a
corporeal substance be changed into an incorporeal, nor can an incorporeal be
changed into that substance which is body, nor yet incorporeals interchange
their proper forms; for only those things can be interchanged and transformed
which possess the common substrate of the same matter, nor can all of these so
