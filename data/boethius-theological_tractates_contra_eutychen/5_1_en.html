description of
substance. But if we neglect incorporeal substances and confine the name nature
to corporeal substances so that they alone appear to possess the nature of
substance—which is the view of Aristotle and the adherents both of
his and various other schools—we shall define nature as those do who
have posited nature as not existing except in bodies. Now, its definition is as
follows: “Nature is the principle of movement, <span class="italic">per
se</span> and not accidental.” I said “principle of
movement” because every body has its proper movement, as fire
upwards, earth downwards. Again, that I propose that nature is “the
principle of movement <span class="italic">per se</span> and not
accidental” is so expressed because a wooden bed is necessarily borne
downward and is not carried downward by accident. For it is drawn downward by
weight and heaviness because it is of wood, <span class="italic">i.e</span>. an
earthly material. For it falls downwards not because it is a bed, but because it
is earth, that is, because it has happened of earth that it should be a bed;
hence we call it wood in virtue of its nature, but bed in virtue of the art that
shaped it.</p>
<p>Nature has, further, another signification according to which we speak of the
different nature of gold and silver, wishing thereby to indicate the special
property of things; this signification of nature will be defined as follows:
“Nature is the specific difference that gives form to
anything.” Thus, although nature is predicated or defined in so many
ways, both Catholics and Nestorius hold that there are in Christ two natures
according to our last definition, but the same differences cannot apply to God
and man.</p>
