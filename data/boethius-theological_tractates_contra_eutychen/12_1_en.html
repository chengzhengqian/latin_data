reaches the other—the kind of union which the Greeks term κατὰ
παράθεσιν “by juxtaposition”? But if humanity has been
united to divinity in this way no one thing has been formed out of the two, and
hence Christ is nothing. The very name of Christ, indeed, denotes by its
singular number a unity. But if the two persons continued and such a union of
natures as we have above described took place, no unity could have been formed
from the two things, for nothing can ever possibly be formed out of two persons.
Therefore Christ is, according to Nestorius, in no respect one, and therefore he
is absolutely nothing. For what is not one cannot exist at all either; because
being and unity are convertible terms, and whatever is one is. Even things which
are made up of many items, such as a heap or chorus, are nevertheless one. Now
we openly and truly confess that Christ is; therefore we say that Christ is one.
And if this is so, then without doubt the person of Christ must be one also. For
if there were two persons he could not be one; but to say that there are two
Christs is nothing else than the madness of a distraught mind. For why should he
ever dare to name two Christs, one man, the other God? Or why does he call him
Christ who is God, if he is also going to call him Christ who is man, when the
two have no common factor, no coherence from being joined? Why should he wrongly
use the same name for two utterly different natures, when, if he is compelled to
define Christ, he cannot, as he himself admits, apply the one substance of his
definition to both Christs? For if the substance of God is different from that
of man, and the one name of Christ applies to both, and the combination
