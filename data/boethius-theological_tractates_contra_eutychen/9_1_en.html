subsistences themselves are present in universals but acquire substance in
particulars they rightly gave the name ὑπόστασις to subsistences which acquired
substance through the medium of particulars. For to no one looking at it with
any care or penetration will subsistence and substance appear identical.</p>
<p>For our equivalents of the Greek terms οὐσίωσις οὐσιῶσθαι are respectively <span class="italic">subsistentia</span> and <span class="italic">subsistere</span>, while
their ὑπόστασις ὐϕίστασθαι are represented by our <span class="italic">substantia</span> and <span class="italic">substare</span>. For a thing has
subsistence when it does not require accidents in order to be, but that thing
has substance which supplies to other things, accidents to wit, a substrate
enabling them to be; for it “stands under” (<span class="italic">sub-stat</span>) those things while it is “put
under” (<span class="italic">sub-iectum</span>) the accidents. Thus genera
and species have only subsistence, for accidents do not attach to genera and
species. But individuals have not only subsistence but also substance, for
neither do they depend on accidents for their being; for they are already
provided with their proper and specific differences and they enable accidents to
be by being, that is, their subjects. Wherefore <span class="italic">esse</span> and
<span class="italic">subsistere</span> represent εἶναι and οὐσιῶσθαι, while <span class="italic">substare</span> represents ὑϕίστασθαι. For Greece, as Marcus
Tullius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_89_a" id="target_note_LCL074_89_a"><sup>a</sup></a> playfully says, is not short of words, but provides as many
equivalents for <span class="italic">essentia, subsistentia, substantia</span> and
<span class="italic">persona</span>—οὐσία for <span class="italic">essentia</span>, οὐσίωσις for <span class="italic">subsistentia</span>, ὑπόστασις
for <span class="italic">substantia</span>, πρόσωπον for <span class="italic">persona</span>. But the Greeks called individual substances ὑποστάσεις
because they underlie the rest and are put under and subject to certain things
such as accidents; and therefore we also call them substances as being </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL074_89_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL074_89_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup><span class="italic">Tusc</span>. ii. 15. 35.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL074_89_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
