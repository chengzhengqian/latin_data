double, but the person one. But as I have
just now remarked that Eutyches confesses two natures in Christ before the
union, but only one after the union, and since I explained that this error
concealed two opinions, that the union was brought about either by begetting
though the human body was certainly not taken from Mary; or, that the union was
effected with what was taken indeed from Mary by means of the Resurrection, I
have, it seems to me, argued the twofold aspect of the case as completely as it
deserves. What we have now to inquire is how it could come to pass that two
natures were combined into one substance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there remains yet another question which can be advanced by those
who do not believe that the human body was taken from Mary, but that the body
was at some other time set apart and prepared, which in the moment of union
appeared to be begotten and brought forth from Maryâ€™s womb. For they
say: if the body was taken from man, while every man was, from the time of the
first transgression, not only bound by sin and death but also involved in sinful
desires, and if his punishment for sin was that, although he was held bound by
death, yet at the same time he should be guilty because of the will to sin, why
was there in Christ neither sin nor any will to sin? And certainly such a
question is attended by a difficulty which deserves attention. For if the body
of Christ was assumed from human flesh, it is open to doubt of what kind we must
consider that flesh to be which was assumed.</p>
