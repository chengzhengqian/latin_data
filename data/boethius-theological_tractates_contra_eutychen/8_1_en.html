“person” seems to be borrowed from a different source,
namely from the masks (<span class="italic">personae</span>) which in comedies and
tragedies used to represent the people concerned. Now <span class="italic">persona</span> with a circumflex on the penultimate is derived from <span class="italic">personare</span>. But if the accent is put on the
antepenultimate<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_87_a" id="target_note_LCL074_87_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the word will clearly be seen to come from <span class="italic">sonus</span> “sound,” and it is from <span class="italic">sonus</span> for this reason, that the sound that is produced is
necessarily greater from the very hollowness of the mask. The Greeks, too, call
these masks πρόσωπα from the fact that they are placed over the face and conceal
the countenance in front of the eyes: παρὰ τοῦ πρὸς τοὺς ὦπας τίθεσθαι (from
being put up against the face). But since, as we have said, it was by the masks
they put on that actors represented the individual people concerned in a tragedy
or comedy—Hecuba or Medea or Simo or Chremes,—so also of
all other men who could be clearly recognized by their appearance the Latins
used the name <span class="italic">persona</span>, the Greeks πρόσωπα. But the Greeks
far more clearly called the individual subsistence of a rational nature by the
name ὑπόστασις, while we through want of appropriate words have kept the name
handed down to us, calling that <span class="italic">persona</span> which they call
ὑπόστασις; but Greece with its richer vocabulary gives the name ὑπόστασις to the
individual subsistence. And, if I may use Greek in dealing with matters which
were dealt with by Greeks before they came to be interpreted in Latin: αἱ οὐσίαι
