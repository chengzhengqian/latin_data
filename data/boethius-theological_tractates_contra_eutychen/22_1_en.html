doubt, thereby, that a
thing which consists of two natures can become one in such a way that the
elements of which it is said to be made up disappear; just as, for example, when
honey is mixed with water neither remains, but each being brought to nothing by
conjunction with the other produces a certain third thing, so that third thing
which is produced by the combination of honey and water is said to consist of
both, but not in both. For it will not be able to consist in both so long as the
nature of both does not continue. For it can consist of both even though each
element of which it is compounded has been brought to nothing by the quality of
the other; but it will not be able to consist in both natures of this kind since
the elements which have been transmuted into each other do not continue, and
both the elements in which it seems to consist cease to be, since it consists of
two things translated into each other by change of qualities.</p>
<p>But Catholics in accordance with reason confess both, for they say that Christ
consists both of and in two natures. How this can be affirmed I will explain a
little later. One thing is now clear; the opinion of Eutyches has been confuted
on the ground that, although there are three ways by which of two natures one
may subsist, viz. either divinity has been translated into humanity or humanity
into divinity or both have been mixed together, the foregoing train of reasoning
shows that no one of these ways could have been effected.</p>
