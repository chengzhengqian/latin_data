or he <span class="italic">did</span> assume
flesh from her, and there were, until indeed he rose, two natures which became
one after the Resurrection. From these alternatives a disjunction arises which
we will examine as follows: Christ who was born of Mary either did or did not
take human flesh from her. If Eutyches does not admit that he took it from her,
then let him say dressed in what manhood he came—that which had
fallen through the transgression of sin or another? If it was the manhood of
that man from whose seed all men descend, what manhood did divinity invest? For
if that flesh in which he was born came not of the seed of Abraham and of David
and finally of Mary, let Eutyches show from what man’s flesh he
descended, since, after the first man, all human flesh is derived from human
flesh. But if he shall name any human besides Mary the Virgin from whom the
Saviour’s begetting came, he will both be himself confounded by
error, and, himself a dupe, will seem to stamp with falsehood the very Godhead
for thus transferring to others the promise of the sacred oracles made to
Abraham and David<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_105_a" id="target_note_LCL074_105_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that of their seed salvation should arise for all
the world, especially since if human flesh was taken it could not be taken from
any other but him of whom it was begotten. If, therefore, his human body was not
taken from Mary but from any other, yet that was engendered through Mary which
had been corrupted by transgression, Eutyches is confuted by the argument
already stated. But if Christ did not put on that manhood which had endured
death in punishment for sin, it will result that of no man’s seed
could ever one have been born who should be without punishment for original sin.
Therefore flesh like this
