was taken from no
man; whence it would appear to have been new-formed. But did this flesh then
either so appear to human eyes that the body was deemed human which was not
really human, because it was not subject to any primal penalty, or was some new
true nature of man formed for the time, not subject to the penalty for original
sin? If it was not a truly human body, the Godhead is plainly convicted of
falsehood for displaying to men a body which since it was not real thus deceived
those who thought it real. But if flesh had been formed new and real and not
taken from man, to what purpose was the tremendous drama of the begetting? Where
the scene of his Passion? I cannot but consider foolish even a human action that
is useless. And to to what useful end shall we say this great humiliation of
Divinity was wrought if ruined man has not been saved by the begetting and
Passion of Christ—for they denied that he was taken into Godhead?
Once more then, just as the error of Eutyches took its rise from the same source
as that of Nestorius, so it sinks into the same end inasmuch as according to
Eutyches also the human race has not been saved,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL074_107_a" id="target_note_LCL074_107_a"><sup>a</sup></a> since man who was
sick and needed health and salvation was not taken into Godhead. Yet this is the
conclusion he seems to have drawn, if he erred so deeply as to believe that
Christ’s body was not formed really from man but from a source
outside him and indeed in heaven, since it is believed to have ascended into
heaven with him. Which is the meaning of the text: “none hath
ascended into heaven save him who came down from heaven.”</p>
