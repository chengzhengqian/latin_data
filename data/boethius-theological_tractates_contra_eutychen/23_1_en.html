the affirmation of Catholic belief Christ consists
at once in and of both natures.</p>
<p>The statement that a thing consists of two natures bears two meanings; one, when
we say that anything is a union of two natures, as <span class="italic">e.g</span>.
honey and water, where the union is such that in the combination, however the
elements be confounded, whether by one nature changing into the other, or by
both mingling with each other, the two entirely disappear. This is the way in
which according to Eutyches Christ consists of two natures.</p>
<p>The other way in which a thing can consist of two natures is when it is so
combined of two that the elements of which it is said to be combined continue
without changing into each other, as when we say that a crown is composed of
gold and gems. Here neither is the gold converted into gems nor is the gem
turned into gold, but both continue without surrendering their proper form.</p>
<p>Things then like this, composed of various elements, we say consist also in the
elements of which they are said to consist. For in this case we can say that a
crown consists of gems and gold, for gems and gold are that in which the crown
consists. For in the former mode of composition honey and water is not that in
which the resulting union of both consists.</p>
<p>Since then the Catholic Faith confesses that both natures continue in Christ and
that they both remain perfect, neither being transformed into the other, it says
with right that Christ consists both in and of the two natures; <span class="italic">in</span> the two because both continue, <span class="italic">of</span> the two because the one person of Christ is formed by the union of
the two continuing natures.</p>
<p>But the Catholic Faith does not hold the union
