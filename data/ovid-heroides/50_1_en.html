<p><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_109_a" id="target_note_LCL041_109_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I <span class="sc">render</span> thanks that Oechalia has been added to the list of our honours; but that the victor has yielded to the vanquished, I complain. The rumour has suddenly spread to all the Pelasgian cities—a rumour unseemly, to which your deeds should give the lie—that on the man whom Juno’s unending series of labours has never crushed, on him Iole has placed her yoke. This would please Eurystheus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_109_b" id="target_note_LCL041_109_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and it would please the sister of the Thunderer; stepdame<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_109_c" id="target_note_LCL041_109_c"><sup>c</sup></a> that she is, she would gladly know of the stain upon your life; but ’twould give no joy to him for whose love-making—if one believes—one night was too short a time for the begetting of one so great.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span><p>More than Juno, Venus has been your bane. The one, by crushing you down, has raised you up; the other has your neck beneath her humbling foot. Look but on the circle of the earth made peaceful by your protecting strength, wherever the blue waters of Nereus wind round the broad land. To you is owing peace upon the earth, to you safety on the seas; you have filled with worthy deeds both abodes of the sun.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_109_d" id="target_note_LCL041_109_d"><sup>d</sup></a> The heaven that is to bear you, yourself once bore; Hercules bent to the load of the stars when Atlas was their stay. What have you gained but to spread the knowledge of your wretched shame, if you seal your former deeds with a base blot? Can it be you that men say clutched
