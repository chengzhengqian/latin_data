and you not here. When once the horns of the moon should have come together in full orb, our shores were to expect your anchor—the moon has four times waned, and four times waxed again to her orb complete; yet the Sithonian wave brings not the ships of Acte.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_21_a" id="target_note_LCL041_21_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Should you count the days—which we count well who love—you will find my plaint come not before its time.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span><p>Hope, too, has been slow to leave me; we are tardy in believing, when belief brings hurt. Even now your lover is reluctant to pronounce you guilty. Oft have I been false to myself in my defence of you; oft have I thought the gusty breezes of the south were bringing back your white sails. Theseus I have cursed, because methought he would not let you go; yet mayhap ’tis not he that has stayed your course. At times have I feared lest, while you were holding toward the waters of the Hebrus, your craft had been wrecked and engulfed in the foaming wave. Oft, bending the knee in prayer that you fare well—ah, base, base man!—have I venerated the gods with prayer or with burning of holy incense; oft, seeing in sky and on sea that the winds were favouring, have I said to myself: “If he do fare well, he is on the way.” In a word, all things soever that hinder those in haste to come, my faithful love has tried to image forth, and my wit has been fertile in the finding of causes. But you delay long your coming; neither do the gods by whom you swore bring you back to me, nor does love of mine move your return. Demophoon, to the winds you gave at once both promised word and sails; your sails, alas! have not returned, your promised word has not been kept.</p>
