<h2>XVIII<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="sc">Leander to Hero</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">He</span> of Abydos sends to you, Maid of Sestos, the greetings he would rather bring, if the waves of the sea should fall.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_245_a" id="target_note_LCL041_245_a"><sup>a</sup></a> If the gods are kindly toward me, if they favour me in my love, you will read with unwilling eye these words of mine. But they are not kindly; for why do they delay my vows, nor suffer me to haste through the well-known waters? You yourself see how the heavens are blacker than pitch, and the straits turbid with winds, and how the hollowed ships can scarce set sail upon them. One seaman only, and he a bold one—he by whom this letter is brought to you—has put out from the harbour; I had embarked with him, but that, as he loosed the cables from the prow, Abydos all was looking down on him. I could not evade my parents, as before, and the love we wish to keep hid would have come to light.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span><p>Forthwith writing these words, “Go, happy letter!” I said; “soon she will reach forth for thee her beautiful hand. Perchance thou wilt even be touched by her approaching lips as she seeks to break thy bands with her snowy tooth.” Speaking such words as these in lowest murmur, the rest I let my right hand say upon the sheet. But ah! how much rather would I have it swim than write, and eagerly bear me through the accustomed waves! It is more fit, I grant, for plying the stroke upon the tranquil deep; yet also apt minister of what I feel.</p>

Besides Ovid, Musaeus, a late Greek (at least 500 <span class="sc">a.d</span>.), is the only prominent poet of antiquity to use it.
