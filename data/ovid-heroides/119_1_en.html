<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span><p>It is now the seventh night, space longer than a year to me, that the troubled sea has been boiling with hoarse-voiced waters. If in all these nights I have had sleep soothe my breast, may I be long kept from you by the raging deep! Sitting upon some rock, I look sadly on your shores, carried in my thoughts to where in body I cannot go. Nay, my vision even sees—or thinks it sees—lights waking in the topmost of your tower. Thrice have I laid down my garments upon the dry sand; thrice, naked, have I tried to enter on the heavy way—the swollen billows opposed the bold attempts of youth, and as I swam, my head was covered by the fronting surge.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">37</span><span class="br"></span><p>But thou, most ungentle of the sweeping winds, why art thou bent on waging war with me? It is I, O Boreas, if thou dost not know, and not the waves, against whom thou ragest! What wouldst thou do, were it not that love is known to thee? Cold as thou art, canst thou yet deny, base wind that of yore thou wert aflame with Actaean fires?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_247_a" id="target_note_LCL041_247_a"><sup>a</sup></a> If, when eager to seek thy joys, someone were to close to thee the paths of air, in what wise wouldst thou endure it? Have mercy on me, I pray; be mild, and stir a more gentle breeze—so may the child of Hippotes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_247_b" id="target_note_LCL041_247_b"><sup>b</sup></a> lay upon thee no harsh command!</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">47</span><span class="br"></span><p>Vain is my petition; my prayers are met by his murmurings, and the waves tossed up by him he nowhere curbs. Now would that Daedalus could give me his daring wings—though the Icarian strand is not far hence! Whatever might be I would endure, so I could only raise into air the body that oft has hung upon the dubious wave.</p>
