held sacred in my eyes; and by the brave souls of my three brothers, to me now spirits divine, who died well for their country, and lie well with it in death; and by your head and mine, which we have laid each to each; and by your sword, weapon well known to my kin—I swear that the Mycenaean has shared no couch with me; if I prove false, wish never to see me more! If now I should say to you, most valiant one: “Do you swear also that you have indulged in no joys apart from me! “you would refuse.

I will be ambassadress and supplicate my lord, and carry many kisses mingled with my message. I shall achieve more than Phoenix, believe me, more than eloquent Ulysses, more than Teucer’s brother! <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_41_b" id="target_note_LCL041_41_b"><sup>b</sup></a> It
