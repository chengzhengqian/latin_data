that deals a wound from afar.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_309_a" id="target_note_LCL041_309_a"><sup>a</sup></a> At any rate, I am not yet well of just such a wound, for I was pierced by your letter, a far-thrown dart. Yet why should you come to me? Surely but a wretched body you would see—the mighty trophy of your skill. I have wasted and fallen away; my colour is bloodless, such as I recall to mind was the hue of that apple of yours, and my face is white, with no rising gleam of mingled red. Such is wont to be the fairness of fresh marble; such is the colour of silver at the banquet table, pale with the chill touch of icy water. Should you see me now, you will declare you have never seen me before, and say: “No arts of mine e’er sought to win a maid like that.” You will remit me the keeping of my promise, in fear lest I become yours, and will long for the goddess to forget it all. Perhaps you will even a second time make me swear, but in contrary wise, and will send me words a second time to read.</p>

Though your heart were harder than steel, Acontius, you yourself would ask pardon for my uttered words.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_309_b" id="target_note_LCL041_309_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Yet, that you be not unaware, the god who sings the fates at Delphi is being asked by what means I may grow strong again. He, too, as vague rumour whispers now, complains on the witness of his sister of a pledge unfilled. This is what the god says, this his prophet, this the published oracle—surely, the wish of your heart lacks no support from the powers that be! Whence this favour to you?— unless perhaps you have found some new writing the reading whereof ensnares even the mighty gods.</p>
