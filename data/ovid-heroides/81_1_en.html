The last of my missive, ere it close, shall be the brief behest: if thou carest ought for me, then care thou for thyself!</p>

<h2>XIV<span class="linebreak"></span><span class="sc">Hypermnestra to Lynceus</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">Hypermnestra</span> sends this letter to the one brother left of so many but now alive—the rest of the company lie dead by the crime of their brides. Kept close in the palace am I, bound with heavy chains; and the cause of my punishment is that I was faithful. Because my hand shrank from driving into your throat the steel, I am charged with crime; I should be praised, had I but dared the deed. Better be charged with crime than thus to have pleased my sire; I feel no regret at having hands free from the shedding of blood. My father may burn me with the flame<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_171_a" id="target_note_LCL041_171_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I would not violate, and hold to my face the torches that shone at my marriage rites; or he may lay to my throat the sword he falsely gave me, so that I, the wife, may die the death my husband did not die—yet he will not bring my dying lips to say “I repent me!” She is not faithful who regrets her faith. Let repentance for crime come to Danaus and my cruel sisters; this is the wonted event that follows on wicked deeds.</p>
