Helle has come to the sea, and is lamenting in down-pouring tears the drowning of her child<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_269_a" id="target_note_LCL041_269_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—or is the step-dame, turned to a goddess of the waters, vexing the sea that is called by her step-child’s hated name?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_269_b" id="target_note_LCL041_269_b"><sup>b</sup></a> This place, such as ’tis now, is aught but friendly to tender maids; by these waters Helle perished, by them my own affliction comes. Yet, Neptune, wert thou mindful of thine own heart’s flames, thou oughtst let no love be hindered by the winds—if neither Amymone, nor Tyro much bepraised for beauty, are stories idly charged to thee, nor shining Alcyone, and Calyce, child of Hecataeon, nor Medusa when her locks were not yet twined with snakes, nor golden-haired Laodice and Celaeno taken to the skies, nor those whose names I mind me of having read.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_269_ca" id="target_note_LCL041_269_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> These, surely, Neptune, and many more, the poets say in their songs have mingled their soft embraces with thine own. Why, then, dost thou, who hast felt so many times the power of love, close up with whirling storm the way we have learned to know? Spare us, impetuous one, and mingle thy battles out upon the open deep! These waters, that separate two lands, are scant. It befits thee, who art mighty, either to toss about the mighty keel, or to be fierce even with entire fleets; ’tis shame for the god of the great sea to terrify a swimming youth— that glory is less than should come from troubling any pond. Noble he is, to be sure, and of a famous stock, but he does not trace his line from the Ulysses thou dost not trust. Have mercy on him, and save us both! It is he who swims, but the limbs of Leander and all my hopes hang on the selfsame wave.</p>
