him well and faithfully, he hates me; this has my candour brought me, this my duteous tongue. And as if there were lack of things to weary me endlessly, a little daughter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_187_a" id="target_note_LCL041_187_a"><sup>a</sup></a> fills the measure of my cares.</p>
