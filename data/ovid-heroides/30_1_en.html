builder of Troy, the illustrious god of the lyre, loved, and let my hands into the secret of his gifts. Whatever herb potent for aid, whatever root that is useful to the healer grows in all the world, is mine. Alas, wretched me, that love may not be healed by herbs! Skilled in an art, I am left helpless by the very art I know.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">153</span><span class="br"></span><p>The aid that neither earth, fruitful in the bringing forth of herbs, nor a god himself, can give, you have the power to bestow on me. You can bestow it, and I have merited—have pity on a deserving maid! I come with no Danai, and bear no bloody armour—but I am yours, and I was your mate in childhood’s years, and yours through all time to come I pray to be!</p>

For the winds might have failed you, even though you longed to see me, and kept you from returning by way of the realms I pledged you;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_69_a" id="target_note_LCL041_69_a"><sup>a</sup></a> but a letter is written, howe’er adverse the wind.
