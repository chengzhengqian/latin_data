refuge by the sea or by the land, let her make trial of the air; let her wander, destitute, bereft of hope, stained red with the blood of her murders! This fate do I, the daughter of Thoas, cheated of my wedded state, in prayer call down upon you. Live on, a wife and husband, accursed in your bed!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Thus,</span> at the summons of fate, casting himself down amid the watery grasses by the shallows of Maeander, sings the white swan.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_83_a" id="target_note_LCL041_83_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>

Are you resolved, Aeneas, to break at the same time from your moorings and from your pledge, and to follow after the fleeting realms of Italy, which lie you know not where? and does new-founded Carthage not touch you, nor her rising walls, nor the sceptre of supreme power placed in your hand? What is achieved, you turn your back upon; what is to be achieved, you ever pursue. One land has been sought and gained, and ever must another be sought, through the wide world.
