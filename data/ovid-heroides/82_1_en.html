<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span><p>My heart is struck with fear at remembrance of that night profaned with blood, and sudden trembling fetters the bones of my right hand. She you think capable of having compassed her husband’s death fears even to write of murder done by hands not her own!</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">21</span><span class="br"></span><p>Yet I shall essay to write. Twilight had just settled on the earth; it was the last part of day and the first of night. We daughters of Inachus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_173_a" id="target_note_LCL041_173_a"><sup>a</sup></a> are escorted beneath the roof of great Pelasgus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_173_b" id="target_note_LCL041_173_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and our husbands’ father<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL041_173_c" id="target_note_LCL041_173_c"><sup>c</sup></a> himself receives the armed brides of his sons. On every side shine bright the lamps girt round with gold; unholy incense is scattered on unwilling altar-fires; the crowd cry “Hymen, Hymenaeus!” The god shuns their cry; Jove’s very consort has withdrawn from the city of her choice! Then, look you, confused with wine, they come in rout amidst the cries of their companions; with fresh flowers in their dripping locks, all joyously they burst into the bridal chambers —the bridal chambers, their own tombs!—and with their bodies press the couches that deserve to be funeral beds.</p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">33</span><span class="br"></span><p>And now, heavy with food and wine they lay in sleep, and deep repose had settled on Argos, free from care—when round about me I seemed to hear the groans of dying men; nay, I heard indeed, and what I feared was true. My blood retreated, warmth left my body and soul, and on my newly-wedded couch all chill I lay. As the gentle zephyr sets a-quiver the slender stalk of grain, as wintry breezes shake the poplar leaves, even thus—yea, even more—did I tremble. Yourself lay quiet in the grip of the sleep the wine had given you.</p>
