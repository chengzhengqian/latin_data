<p><span class="sc">Read</span> through these lines, Drepanius, needfully judging whether you think they should be pardoned or perused. With you as judge I shall be content, whether you think the verse I send worth conning or concealing. For my first aim, Pacatus, is to earn your countenance: to defend my modesty shall be my second thought. I can bear a stern reader’s criticism, and I can satisfy myself with a modest meed of praise: a horse learns to love the sound of a patted neck, learns also to endure the pliant lash unterrified.
