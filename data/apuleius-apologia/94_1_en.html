your fourteen years of widowhood! The viper, so I hear, gnaws through its mother’s womb before it crawls into the daylight, and so murders its parent at birth: but your full-grown son gnaws <span class="italic">you</span> more painfully while you still live and breathe. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>Your discretion is ravaged, your honor attacked, your heart pierced, your very innards ripped out. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>Is this the gratitude that a good son shows to the mother who gave you life, who increased your inheritance, who raised you for fourteen long years?

They had each of them read out in public, but prohibited the reading of one that he had written to his wife Olympias. They spared their enemy rather than exposing conjugal privacy, thinking that a general right ranked higher than personal revenge. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>That is how enemies dealt with an enemy: what kind of son were you in dealing with your mother? You see how close my comparison is!
