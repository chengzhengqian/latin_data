<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>I repeat, take it, you model son, put away your mother’s love letters for a moment<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_233_171" id="target_note_LCL534_233_171"><sup>171</sup></a> and read her will. If anything in it seems written by a madwoman, you will find it here, in fact just in the opening words: “Let my son Sicinius Pudens be my heir.” I admit it, anyone reading this will think it mad. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>(<span class="italic">To Pudentilla:</span>) Is this son your heir? Why, even at his brother’s funeral he summoned a gang of young desperadoes, and tried to shut you out of the house that you yourself had given him. He was furious and resentful because you had made his brother his coheir. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>He immediately deserted you in your grief and sorrow, and fled from your protection to Rufinus and Aemilianus. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>He hurled many insults at you with his uncle present and assisting him. He bandied your name about the law courts. He used your very own letters in trying to dishonor you with the public. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>He brought a capital charge against your chosen husband, whom you loved devotedly, as he himself rebuked you for doing. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>Open, if you please, you loving son, open the will: that way you will more easily prove your mother insane.</p>

<p>101. Why do you decline, why refuse, now that you have shed your worry about your mother’s bequest? Meanwhile <span class="italic">I,</span> Maximus, throw this will here before your feet, and call you to witness that from now on I will be quite indifferent to what Pudentilla writes in her will. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>Now let him plead his own case to his mother as he pleases; <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>he has left me no motive to make further pleas on his behalf. Let him, as his own master and a grown man, write letters full of bitterness to his mother, and try to assuage her anger: he could plead in court, he can surely plead for himself. By now I have long been satisfied not just with rebutting the alleged crimes in full, but also with tearing out the root cause of this trial, which is resentment over a hoped-for legacy.</p>
