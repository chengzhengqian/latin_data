Aemilianus’ mind,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_231_170" id="target_note_LCL534_231_170"><sup>170</sup></a> and to have informed him of something so unexpected. Just see, if you please, Maximus, how this news has made him suddenly go silent and turn his eyes to the ground. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>For what he had supposed was very different, and for good reason; he knew that the son had smeared the lady with insults, while I had endeared her by kindness. He had reason to fear me too: anyone, even one so indifferent to legacies as I am, might still not have shrunk from avenging himself on so undutiful a stepson. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>It was this worry above all that prompted them to prosecute me: their own greed made them guess that I had been left the whole estate. (<span class="italic">To Aemilianus and his supporters:</span>) As to the past, let me relieve you of that fear, for neither the chance of receiving a legacy nor of getting my revenge could have swayed me. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>As a stepfather, I fought for a wicked stepson against his angry mother, as a father would for the best of sons against a stepmother, and I did not rest until I had restrained my kind wife’s lavish generosity to me to a far greater degree than was fair.</p>
