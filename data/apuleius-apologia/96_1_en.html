Greek? And why should I ply her with such absurd, barroom compliments when these same people call me quite clever at writing risqué love poems? <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>In short, the fact is this, as anyone can see: this man, who could not read Pudentilla’s letter in idiomatic Greek, was more at ease reading one of his own and more skillful at communicating it.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>But I will soon have done with letters when I have added this one point. Pudentilla had written, “So come  while I am still of sound mind” in a spirit of irony and jest; and after writing this letter she invited her sons and daughter-in-law to join her, and spent about two months with them. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>Now let her dutiful son mention anything untoward he saw his mother do or say at that time because of insanity. Let him deny that she most meticulously audited the account books of her stewards, herdsmen, and grooms. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>Let him deny that that she strongly advised his brother Pontianus to beware of Rufinus’ treacheries. Let him deny that she quite properly scolded him because he had publicly circulated a letter she had sent him, and even so had not read it in good faith.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_203_148" id="target_note_LCL534_203_148"><sup>148</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>Let him deny, after all I have said, that his mother married me at her country house, a place we had long since arranged. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>For we had agreed to prefer a house outside of town for our marriage, so that the citizenry would not flock there again in hope of wedding favors.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_203_149a" id="target_note_LCL534_203_149a"><sup>149</sup></a> Not long before, Pudentilla had paid out fifty thousand sesterces of her own money to the people on the day Pontianus married and the boy here assumed the toga. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>Moreover, we wanted to dispense with the many banquets and nuisances that newlyweds usually have to go through according to custom.</p>
