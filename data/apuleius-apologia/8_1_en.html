Just now I saw some people here scarcely able to restrain their mirth, no doubt because the speaker there was sharply attacking oral hygiene and uttering the word “dentifrice” with more indignation than any one has ever uttered “poison.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_27_13" id="target_note_LCL534_27_13"><sup>13</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>And why not?
