<p>89. Now about Pudentilla’s age you went on to tell such a barefaced lie as to say that she married at sixty. On this matter my answer will be brief, since there is no call for lengthy argument when the facts are so clear. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>Like other fathers, her father registered his daughter’s birth. The records are kept both in the public record office and at home, and they are now being brought for you to see. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>(<span class="italic">To the servant of the court:</span>) You, hand those records to Aemilianus; let him examine the thread, acknowledge the stamped seals, read the names of the consuls, calculate the years, of which he bestowed sixty on the lady.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_207_154" id="target_note_LCL534_207_154"><sup>154</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>If he acknowledged fifty-five, his lie would be five years off, but that is not enough. I will be more generous, since he himself lavished many years on Pudentilla, so in turn I will give him back ten.

<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>Do I need to say more? I am dealing with a fourfolder,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_207_156" id="target_note_LCL534_207_156"><sup>156</sup></a> so I will multiply five years by four and subtract a total of twenty years. Have the consuls counted up, Maximus, and if I am not mistaken, you will find that Pudentilla is barely past her fortieth year. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>What a bold, extravagant falsehood! What a lie, worth a penalty of twenty
