you are speaking before Claudius Maximus, an upright man busy with the affairs of the entire province? <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>I repeat, won’t you drop this empty abuse? Won’t you prove your allegations—monstrous crimes, forbidden magic, the black arts? Why is your speech so weak on facts and so strong on noise?</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>(<span class="italic">Turning to address Maximus.</span>) Well, I now come to the actual charge of magic, which he set ablaze with a tremendous roar to make me disliked, and then, disappointing everyone’s expectation, doused it with a few old wives’ tales. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>Have you ever, Maximus, seen a fire starting from stubble? It crackles loudly, shines brightly, spreads quickly, but lacking fuel its flames die down and leave no trace.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_71_59" id="target_note_LCL534_71_59"><sup>59</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>Well, that is like this prosecution: begun with insults, heaped up with verbiage, short of proofs, but after your verdict fated to leave no trace of its slanders.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">8</span><span class="br"></span>Since Aemilianus rested it entirely on this one point, that I was a magician, I would like to inquire of his most learned advocates what a magician is. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>For if a magician in the Persian language is what a priest is in ours, as I have read in many authors, what kind of crime is it to be a priest and to have the right information, knowledge and mastery of the ceremonial rules, ritual requirements, and sacred laws? <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>Provided of course that Plato understands what magic is when he recalls the lessons that the Persians use to initiate a youth in kingship. I remember the very words of that inspired man, and you, Maximus, may recall them together with me:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_71_60" id="target_note_LCL534_71_60"><sup>60</sup></a> </p>
