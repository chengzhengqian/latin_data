were led to invent this lie because they say Venus rose from the sea. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>Let me tell you, Tannonius Pudens, how little you knew when you took fish to be a proof of magic, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>whereas if you had read Virgil, you would certainly have known that the things usually required for this purpose are different. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>For as far as I know he lists soft wreaths of wool, leafy boughs, balls of incense, threads of different colors, and moreover laurel leaves that crackle, mud that hardens, wax that softens,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_83_67" id="target_note_LCL534_83_67"><sup>67</sup></a> all of which he included, this time in a serious poem:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_83_68" id="target_note_LCL534_83_68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span>But you with your allegations against fish suppose that magicians use very different means, not one trimmed from soft foreheads but skimmed from scaly backs, not torn from the earth but drawn from the deep, not harvested with sickles but impaled on hooks. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span>Finally, Virgil talks of using poison to cast a spell while you talk of savories, he talks of herbs and twigs while you talk of scales and bones, he culls a meadow while you scour the deep.</p>
<p><span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span>I would also have quoted you similar lines of Theocritus and many others of Homer and Orpheus, I would have cited many passages from Greek tragedy and comedy and from histories, except that I noticed long ago that you could not read Pudentilla’s letter written in Greek.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_83_70" id="target_note_LCL534_83_70"><sup>70</sup></a>
