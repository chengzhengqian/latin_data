<p>95. I know full well that I should have followed this letter with my summation. For what more generous eulogist, more unimpeachable witness to my way of life, in short more eloquent advocate could I produce? <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span>In the course of my life I have closely observed many eloquent men among citizens of Rome, but there is none I have so much admired. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span>There is no one today, in my opinion, who has some repute and promise as an orator, <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>and yet would not far prefer to be Avitus, if he chose to put aside envy and compare himself with him; since all the oratorical virtues, almost irreconcilable as they are, come together in him alone. <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>Any speech composed by Avitus will be so perfectly finished in every way that Cato could not ask for more solemnity, Laelius more smoothness, Gracchus more force, Caesar more warmth, Hortensius more structure, Calvus more animation, Sallust more economy, Cicero more richness.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL534_221_164a" id="target_note_LCL534_221_164a"><sup>164</sup></a> <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>In sum, I repeat, not to name every orator, after once hearing Avitus you would want nothing added, nothing removed, and indeed nothing altered.</p>
