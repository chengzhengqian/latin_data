seems to refer to the time which included the Battle of Actium and succeeding events, when Maecenas, in the absence of Octavian, had full control in Rome and Italy. The mention of the Dacians in 1.53 reminds us that these people wavered between Octavian and Antony and that Crassus was sent against them in 30 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. Again, the assignment of lands to the veterans, referred to in 1.55, is doubtless the reward promised for services at Actium. In this connexion some of the soldiers mutinied in the winter of 31 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. The Satire therefore was composed late in 31 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> or early in 30 <span class="sc">b.c</span>, and it follows from 11.40 ff. that Horace entered the circle of Maecenas in 39 or 38 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> The Sabine farm was given to the poet some six years later.</p>
