<p>“You look upon me as an informer, but even if you are a rogue I am no informer. My friends will acquit me of such a charge. I am not writing for the general public, and my object is not to give pain. Yet it is my habit to observe the conduct of others, and to profit thereby, for I was trained to do so by my father, and have always continued the practice. To be sure, I jot down my thoughts, but what of that? Nowadays everybody writes, and you, my critic, willy-nilly, will take to writing yourself” (65-143).</p>
<p>On the appearance of his first <span class="italic">Satires</span> (and it is to be noticed that the carefully chosen subjunctive <span class="italic">habeat</span> in 1.71 does not preclude their publication), the poet’s critics had accused Horace of being a malevolent scandal-monger. They also contrasted him unfavourably with Lucilius, who in his open warfare used the weapons of Old Comedy, was familiar with the Greek moralists and philosophers, and had the pen of a ready writer. In his reply, Horace maintains that his own satire is not personal, but rather social and general in its application. He does not indulge in the invective of Old Comedy, but rather follows the New in spirit as well as in style. His teacher in morals, if not a great philosopher (<span class="italic">cf</span>. <span class="italic">sapiens</span>, 1, 115), was a representative of the fine, old-fashioned Roman virtues, even his own father. As for the copiousness of Lucilius, that was his predecessor’s chief fault, which he himself would carefully avoid.</p>
<p>This is one of the early Satires, and in view of the citation in 1.92 is to be associated closely with the Second. As there is no reference to Maecenas, it was probably composed before the poet’s introduction to the statesman in 38 <span class="sc">b.c</span>.</p>
