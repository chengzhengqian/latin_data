<p>Though Horace thus allows his own name to be used, the dialogue is really between <span class="italic">any</span> slave and <span class="italic">any</span> master. It is true that, to heighten the humour of the scene, he introduces, at the beginning and perhaps at the end of the criticism of the master (so 11. 22-35; 111-115), some of the atmosphere of reality, but so far as the main features of the master’s portrait are concerned, it would be more correct to regard the slave Davus, the preacher of wisdom, as the Horace of real life. That the poet is not describing himself with any consistency is clear from 11.102, ff., where he is accused of gluttony, whereas we know that he was very abstemious (<span class="italic">cf. Sat.</span> i. 5.7-9). The seeming self-accusation as to serious offences, therefore, we may put down to dramatic necessity or to comic exaggeration.</p>
<p>The dialogue form is maintained throughout, though during the delivery of Crispinus’s lecture it is held in suspense.</p>
