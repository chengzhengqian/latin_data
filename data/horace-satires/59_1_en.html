<p><sup>50</sup>But I did say his stream runs muddy, and often carries more that you would rather remove than leave behind. Come, pray, do you, a scholar, criticize nothing in the great Homer? Does your genial Lucilius find nothing to change in the tragedies of Accius? Does he not laugh at the verses of Ennius as lacking in dignity, though he speaks of himself as no greater than those he has blamed? And as we read the writings of Lucilius, what forbids us, too, to raise the question whether it was his own genius, or whether it was the harsh nature of his themes that denied him verses more finished and easier in their flow than if one were to put his thoughts into six feet<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_121_a" id="target_note_LCL194_121_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and, content with this alone, were proud of having written two hundred lines before and two hundred after supping? Such was the gift of Tuscan Cassius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_121_b" id="target_note_LCL194_121_b"><sup>b</sup></a> more headstrong than a rushing river, whose own books and cases, so ’tis told us, made his funeral pile.</p>
<p><sup>64</sup>Grant, say I, that Lucilius was genial and witty<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_121_c" id="target_note_LCL194_121_c"><sup>c</sup></a>: grant that he was also more polished than you would expect one to be who was creating a new style quite untouched by the Greeks,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_121_d" id="target_note_LCL194_121_d"><sup>d</sup></a> and more polished than the crowd of older poets: yet, had he fallen by fate upon this our day, he would smooth away much of his work, would prune off all that trailed beyond the proper limit, and as he wrought his verse he would oft scratch his head and gnaw his nails to the quick.</p>
<p><sup>72</sup>Often must you turn your pencil to erase,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_121_ea" id="target_note_LCL194_121_ea"><sup>e</sup></a> if you hope to write something worth a second reading, and you must not strive to catch the wonder of the crowd,
