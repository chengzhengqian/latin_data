more childish than such ways, that it makes no difference whether you play at building in the sand, as you did when three years old, or whine in anxiety for love of a mistress, I ask you, will you do as once Polemon did, when converted? Will you lay aside the tokens of your malady, garters, elbow-cushion, neck-wrap,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_175_a" id="target_note_LCL194_175_a"><sup>a</sup></a> even as he,’tis said, stealthily plucked the chaplets from his neck after a carouse, the moment he was arrested by the voice of his fasting master?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_175_b" id="target_note_LCL194_175_b"><sup>b</sup></a> When you offer apples to a sulky child, he refuses them. ‘Take them, pet.’ He says, ‘No.’ Were you not to offer them, he would crave them.
