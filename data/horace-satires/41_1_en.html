for if after a given age Nature should call upon us to traverse our past lives again, and to choose in keeping with our pride any other parents each might crave— content with my own, I should decline to take those adorned with the rods and chairs of state.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_85_a" id="target_note_LCL194_85_a"><sup>a</sup></a> And though the world would deem me mad, you, I hope, would think me sane for declining to shoulder a burden of trouble to which I have never been accustomed. For at once I should have to enlarge my means, to welcome more callers, to take one or two in my company so as not to go abroad or into the country alone; I should have to keep more pages and ponies, and take a train of wagons. To-day, if I will, I may go on a bob-tailed mule even to Tarentum, the saddle-bag’s weight galling his loins, and the rider his withers.

I listen to the fortune-tellers; then homeward betake me to my dish of leeks and peas and fritters. My supper is served by three boys, and a white stone-slab supports two cups with a ladle. By them stand a cheap salt-cellar, a jug and saucer of Campanian ware. Then I go off to sleep, untroubled with the thought that I must rise early on the morrow
