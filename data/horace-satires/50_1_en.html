<h3>IX</h3>
<h3><span class="ac">An Unwelcome Companion</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">While</span> taking a morning stroll, Horace is joined by a mere acquaintance, who insists on accompanying him, hoping through closer intimacy to secure an introduction to Maecenas. The poet vainly endeavours to shake him off, and it is only when the man’s adversary in a lawsuit appears on the scene— a genuine <span class="italic">deus ex machina</span>—that Horace is rescued from his unhappy position.</p>
<p>The delightful humour, the skilful dramatic treatment of the theme, and the poet’s well-established position in Maecenas’s circle which is assumed, indicate that this is one of the latest Satires, in point of composition, in the first book. It may be compared with the sixth Satire, in which Horace gives an account of his introduction to Maecenas.</p>
<p>For the connexion of this Satire with Lucilius see Introduction C.</p>
