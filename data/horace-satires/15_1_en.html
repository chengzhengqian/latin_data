<p>All singers have this fault: if asked to sing among their friends they are never so inclined; if unasked, they never leave off. That son of Sardinia, Tigellius, was of this sort. If Caesar, who might have forced him to comply, should beg him by his father’s friendship and his own, he could make no headway. If the man took the fancy, then from the egg-course to the fruit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_33_a" id="target_note_LCL194_33_a"><sup>a</sup></a> he would keep chanting “Io Bacche!”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_33_b" id="target_note_LCL194_33_b"><sup>b</sup></a> now with highest voice and now with one responding in lowest pitch to the tetrachord.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_33_c" id="target_note_LCL194_33_c"><sup>c</sup></a> There was nothing consistent in the fellow. Often he would run as if fleeing from a foe; very often he would stalk as slowly as some bearer of Juno’s holy offerings.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_33_d" id="target_note_LCL194_33_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Often he would keep two hundred slaves, often only ten. Now he would talk of kings and tetrarchs, everything grand, and now he’d say, “Give me a three-legged table, a shell of clean salt, and a coat that, however coarse, can keep out the cold.” Suppose you had given a million<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_33_e" id="target_note_LCL194_33_e"><sup>e</sup></a> to this thrifty gentleman, contented with so little; in a week there was nothing in his pockets. All night, till dawn, he would stay awake; all day would snore. Never was a creature so inconsistent.</p>
