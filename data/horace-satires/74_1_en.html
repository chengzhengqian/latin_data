<p>This is not only the longest, but also the best constructed of Horace’s Satires. Notwithstanding the long discourse which makes up the main body of the poem, the dialogue-form serves as a framework for the whole, and allows the poet to employ a light, humorous vein in both beginning and end, where he turns the laugh against himself. Note that while the writer’s main aim throughout is to portray striking forms of human folly, a second one is to ridicule the airs and manners of the Stoic preachers of the day. The Satire was probably written in 33 <span class="sc">b.c</span>., because in 1.185 there is a reference to the curule aedileship of Agrippa, held in that year and distinguished by magnificence of display.</p>
