a prominent feature of the prose satire of Lucian, upon which many modern satires have been modelled, such as Disraeli’s <span class="italic">Ixion in Heaven</span> and <span class="italic">The Infernal Marriage</span>, and Bangs’s <span class="italic">Houseboat on the Styx</span>. Lucian’s resemblances to Horace, which, according to Lejay, are due to a direct knowledge of the Roman poet on the part of Lucian, may really be the result of their common indebtedness to Menippus of Gadara (<span class="italic">cf</span>. Fiske, <span class="italic">Lucilius and Horace</span>, p. 401). Sellar describes the poem before us as “the most trenchant of all the Satires” of Horace, who doubtless conceived the utmost contempt for the fortune-hunters of his day. No analysis is necessary.</p>
