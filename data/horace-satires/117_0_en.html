<h3><span class="ac">A Fiasco of a Dinner-Party</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> poet describes a dinner at which Maecenas was the guest of honour. Three men of letters were also in the companyâ€”Fundanius, Viscus, and Varius. The rest of the guests are undistinguished, and are probably imaginary characters who could not be identified. Porcius, for instance, true to his name, eats like a pig. Balatro is a buffoon, and Nomentanus is one of the traditional characters of satire. Moreover, the host, Nasidienus Rufus, is otherwise quite unknown.</p>
<p>These facts warrant us in acquitting Fundanius (and therefore the author who introduced him) on the charge of extremely bad taste in heaping ridicule on a host whose hospitality had been accepted. Horace, in fact, adopts a principle, which is illustrated in the previous Satire, of securing a certain amount of verisimilitude through the use of known facts, and of drawing on his imagination for the rest of his material. The Satire is directed, partly against the ostentation and vulgarity sometimes displayed by wealth, and partly against the curious and affected erudition of pronounced epicures. In this latter respect it resembles the fourth Satire of this book.</p>
