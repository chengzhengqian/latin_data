<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">Damasippus.</span><p class="lineGroup">So seldom do you write, that not four times in all the year do you call for the parchment,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_153_a" id="target_note_LCL194_153_a"><sup>a</sup></a> while you unweave the web of all you have written,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_153_b" id="target_note_LCL194_153_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and are angry with yourself because, while so generous of wine and of sleep, you turn out no poetry worth talking about. What will be the end? Why, you say, even in the Saturnalia you fled here for refuge. Well then, in your sober mood, tell something worthy of your promises. Begin. Nothing comes. In vain you blame the pen; and the innocent wall, begotten when gods and poets were angry, must suffer.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_153_c" id="target_note_LCL194_153_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Yet you had the look of one who threatened great and glorious things, if once you were care-free and your country cottage welcomed you under its warm roof.

You must shun the wicked Siren, Sloth, or be content to drop whatever honour you have gained in nobler hours.</p></div>
