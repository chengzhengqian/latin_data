turbot, since cloying plenty worries the jaded stomach, which, sated as it is, prefers radishes and tart pickles the while. Nor is the poor man’s fare yet wholly banished from the feasts of kings, for cheap eggs and black olives still have a place. ’Tis not so long ago that by reason of a sturgeon the table of Gallonius the auctioneer won ill repute.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_141_a" id="target_note_LCL194_141_a"><sup>a</sup></a> What? Was the sea less a home for turbots in those days? The turbot was safe, and safe was the nest of the stork, till a praetor’s sanction taught you the lesson.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_141_ba" id="target_note_LCL194_141_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> So now, should someone decree that roasted gulls are delicacies, our Roman youth, quick to learn ill ways, will obey.</p>
<p><sup>53</sup>A mean style of living will differ, so Ofellus thinks, from a simple one; for it will be idle for you to shun one fault, if you turn aside into another crooked path. Avidienus, to whom the nickname “Dog” quite rightly clings, eats his olives five years old with cornels from the wood, and is chary of drawing his wine till it has soured; as to his oil, you couldn’t bear its smell, yet even if in his whitened garb<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_141_c" id="target_note_LCL194_141_c"><sup>c</sup></a> he keeps a wedding or birthday feast or some other holiday, he drops it on the salad from a two-pound horn with his own hands, though his old vinegar he does not stint. What style then will the wise man adopt, and which of these two will he copy? On the one side, as the saying is, a wolf attacks, on the other a dog. He will be neat, so far as not to shock us by meanness, and in his mode of living will be unhappy in neither direction. He will neither, like old Albucius, be cruel to his slaves, as he assigns
