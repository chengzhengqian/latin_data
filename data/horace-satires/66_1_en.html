is an unnatural rarity, the latter is common, and the well-fed stomach scorns things common. Some day we shall find roast gulls in fashion (1-52).</p>
<p>Plain living is not the same as mean living, and you must not avoid one fault merely to fall into another. There is a happy mean between stinginess and extravagance (53-69).</p>
<p>A simple fare means health of body, a good digestion, sound and refreshing sleep, mental vigour. It allows one to indulge himself occasionally, as when the holidays come, or in times of ill-health, or when old age arrives. In the good old days dainties were reserved for hospitality (70-93).</p>
<p>A luxurious life leads to disgrace and ruin. “That may be true of others,” says one, “but I can well afford to be extravagant.” Then why not use your money for better ends? And what about the changes and chances of life? Which of the two will meet them best, the man accustomed to every comfort, or the one who is content with little (94-111)?</p>
<p>I knew Ofellus in my boyhood, when he was the well-to-do owner of the land on which he now pays rent. In those days he lived the same simple life that he does now, and when misfortunes came, he faced them bravely and in true philosophic fashion (113-136).</p>
<p>Kiessling has pointed out how closely this Satire reproduces some ideas found in the well-known letter of Epicurus to Menoecus (Diog. Laert. x. 131), but Lejay has also called attention to striking parallels in Cicero’s philosophical writings. Even the phrase <span class="italic">tenuis victus</span> (1.53) is Ciceronian (<span class="italic">cf</span>. <span class="italic">Tusc</span>. <span class="italic">Disp</span>. iii. 49.5; v. 26.89, etc.). “Cicéron,” says Lejay (p. 380), “est peut-être encore plus complètement l’inspiration des grandes lignes de la satire.”</p>
