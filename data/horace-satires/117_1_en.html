<p>Fiske has shown that Lucilius was “the first to establish the traditions of the δεῖπνον in Latin Satire,” and that in this Eighth Satire Horace keeps in fairly close touch with the twentieth book of Lucilius, where a banquet given by the <span class="italic">praeco</span> Granius was reported to the satirist by L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="italic">Lucilius and Horace</span>, pp. 408 ff.). But, as Lucilius wrote at least five satires on banquets, it is not surprising to find that Lejay (p. 580) regards his fifth book as the chief model followed here by Horace.</p>
