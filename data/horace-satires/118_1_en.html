Around it were pungent turnips, lettuces, radishes—such things as whet a jaded appetite—skirret, fish-pickle, and Coan lees. When these were removed, a high-girt slave with purple napkin wiped well the maple-wood table, while a second swept up the scraps and anything that could offend the guests. Then, like an Attic maid<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_239_c" id="target_note_LCL194_239_c"><sup>c</sup></a> bearing Ceres’ sacred emblems, there came forward dusky Hydaspes with Caecuban wine, and Alcon with Chian, unmixed with brine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_239_d" id="target_note_LCL194_239_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Then said our host: “If Alban is more to your taste, Maecenas, or Falernian, we have both.”</p></div>
