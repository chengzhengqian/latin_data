evening, and you fear that a tough fowl may answer ill to his taste, you will be wise to plunge it alive into diluted Falernian: this will make it tender.</p>
<p>Mushrooms from the meadows are best; others are not to be trusted.</p>
<p>A man will pass his summers in health, who will finish his luncheon with black mulberries which he has picked from the tree before the sun is trying.</p>
<p>Aufidius used to mix his honey with strong Falernian—unwisely; for when the veins are empty one should admit nothing to them that is not mild. With mild mead you will do better to flood the stomach. If the bowels be costive, limpet and common shell-fish will dispel the trouble, or low-growing sorrel—but not without white Coan wine.</p>
<p>New moons swell the slippery shell-fish, but it is not every sea that yields the choicest kind. The Lucrine mussel is better than the Baian cockle. Oysters come from Circeii, sea-urchins from Misenum, luxurious Tarentum plumes herself on her broad scallops.</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>It is not everyone that may lightly claim skill in the dining art, without first mastering the subtle theory of flavours. Nor is it enough to sweep up fish from the expensive stall, not knowing which are better with sauce, and which, if broiled, will tempt the tired guest to raise himself once more upon his elbow.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_189_a" id="target_note_LCL194_189_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>From Umbria, fed on holm-oak acorns, comes the boar that makes the round dish bend, when the host would shun tasteless meat; for the Laurentian is a poor beast, being fattened on sedge and reeds.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_189_b" id="target_note_LCL194_189_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
