sturdy tenant-farmer, and this is his story: “I was not the man to eat on a working day, without good reason, anything more than greens and the shank of a smoked ham, and if after long absence a friend came to see me, or if in rainy weather, when I could not work, a neighbour paid me a visit—a welcome guest—we fared well, not with fish sent for from town, but with a pullet or a kid; by and by raisins and nuts and split figs set off our dessert. Then we had a game of drinking, with a forfeit to rule the feast,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_147_a" id="target_note_LCL194_147_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and Ceres, to whom we made our prayer—“so might she rise on lofty stalk!”—smoothed out with wine the worries of a wrinkled brow. Let Fortune storm and stir fresh turmoils; how much will she take off from this? How much less sleek have I been, or you, my lads, since this new landlord came? Nature, in truth, makes neither him nor me nor anyone else lord of the soil as his own. He drove us out, and he will be driven out by villainy, or by ignorance of the quirks of the law, or in the last resort by an heir of longer life. To-day the land bears the name of Umbrenus; of late it had that of Ofellus; to no one will it belong for good, but for use it will pass, now to me and now to another.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_147_ba" id="target_note_LCL194_147_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> Live, then, as brave men, and with brave hearts confront the strokes of fate.”</p>
