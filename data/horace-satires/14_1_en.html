<p>“If he were a king,” did I say? Why, according to another of his paradoxes, the Stoic is already a king, even as he is rich and handsome and everything else that is good. “Yes,” he would explain, “I am a king potentially, even as Hermogenes is a singer, though he does not open his lips.” “Well,” replies Horace,” I cannot see that your crown wins you esteem or saves you from ill-treatment. For myself, not being a philosopher, I will remain a private citizen, and live on terms of mutual forbearance with others” (124-142).</p>
<p>In striking contrast with Satire II., this one is kindly and genial in tone, and it would seem that the author was disarming criticism by his assurance that he was not disposed to be over-censorious, as we learn from 11.63 ff. Horace has now become acquainted with Maecenas, and this improvement in his worldly prospects may to some extent account for the change of tone, and the doffing of the severity of Lucilian invective.</p>
