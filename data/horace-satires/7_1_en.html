<h3><span class="ac">The Folly Of Running To Extremes</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Men</span> seldom keep the golden mean, but run from one extreme to another. Especially may this be illustrated by victims of sensual indulgence and by people guilty of adultery, a vice which has become a shocking feature of the age.</p>
<p>This immature and forbidding sketch, coarse and sensational in tone, and doubtless one of Horace’s earliest efforts, is closely associated with the Lucilian type of satire. It abounds in personalities, freely handled, and Horace himself (in <span class="italic">Sat</span>. i. 4.92) cites it later as an illustration of the kind of writing which had aroused enmity against the author. Even Maecenas, if we are to believe the scholiasts, is thinly disguised in the Maltinus of 1.25.</p>
<p>In his introduction to this Satire, Lejay has shown how dependent it ultimately is “upon the erotic literature of the Hellenistic period as expressed in the popular Cynic philosophy, in the New Comedy, and in the <span class="italic">Anthology</span>” (Fiske, p. 251). There is a striking parallel between it and a poem on love in the <span class="italic">Oxyrhynchus Papyri</span> by the Cynic Cercidas of Megalopolis, who lived in the latter part of the third century <span class="sc">b.c</span>. See Chapter I. of Powell and Barber’s <span class="italic">New Chapters in the History of Greek Literature</span> (Oxford, 1921).</p>
