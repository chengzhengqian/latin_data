You with eyes open will pass under the yoke, and hand over to a furious master your fortune, your life, your person and repute.</p>
<p><sup>68</sup>Suppose you have escaped: then, I take it, you will be afraid and cautious after your lesson. No, you will seek occasion so as again to be in terror, again to face ruin, O you slave many times over! But what beast, having once burst its bonds and escaped, perversely returns to them again? “I am no adulterer,” you say. And, in faith, I am no thief either, when I wisely pass by your silver plate. Take away the risk, set aside restraint, and Nature will spring forward, to roam at will.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_231_b" id="target_note_LCL194_231_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Are you my master, you, a slave to the dominion of so many men and things—you, whom the praetor’s rod, though placed on your head three or four times over,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_231_c" id="target_note_LCL194_231_c"><sup>c</sup></a> never frees from base terror?

Why, you, who lord it over me, are the wretched slave of another master, and you are moved like a wooden puppet by wires that others pull.</p>
<p><sup>83</sup>Who then is free? The wise man, who is lord over himself, whom neither poverty nor death nor bonds affright, who bravely defies his passions, and scorns ambition, who in himself is a whole, smoothed and rounded, so that nothing from outside can rest
