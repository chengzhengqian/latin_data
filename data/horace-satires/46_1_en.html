<h3><span class="ac">How Priapus Put Witches to Rout</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Horace</span> lays the scene of this incident in that part of the Esquiline which lay outside the famous <span class="italic">Agger</span>, or Mound of Servius, on the north-east side of Rome. In this district there had long been a burial-place, used especially for criminals and paupers, where, among the tombs, witches practised their weird and infernal rites. Here, however, Maecenas, co-operating with Augustus in the work of city improvement, had laid out beautiful gardens, in which he later built himself a palace with a conspicuous tower.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_95_a" id="target_note_LCL194_95_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>The incident must be supposed to have occurred before the transformation from a squalid and repulsive site had been completed. A wooden statue, however, of Priapus, the god of gardens, had already been set up.</p>
<p>The gruesome story of the witches’ incantations comes to a ridiculous end when the wood of the statue cracked, and the noise of the explosion drove the hags away in terror.</p>
<p>The Satire is closely connected in subject with Epodes 5 and 17. Virgil’s eighth Eclogue may also be compared, as well as the three <span class="italic">Priapea</span> to be found among the minor poems attributed to Virgil.</p>
