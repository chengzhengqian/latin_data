lightly do we set up an unjust law to our own harm; For no living wight is without faults: the best is he who is burdened with the least. My kindly friend must, as is fair, weigh my virtues against my faults, if he wishes to gain my love, and must turn the scales in their favour as being the more numerous—if only my virtues are the more numerous.
