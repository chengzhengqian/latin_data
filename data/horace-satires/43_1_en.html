<h3><span class="ac">Ho For A Regicide!</span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">The</span> incident recorded here occurred, probably in 43 <span class="sc">b.c</span>., at Clazomenae in Asia Minor, when Brutus, as propraetor of the Province, was holding court, and Horace was serving as tribune in his army. The poem gives us a single scene, a battle of wit between two litigants, Rupilius Rex, of Praeneste, a man proscribed by Antony and Octavius, and Persius, a half-Greek, half-Roman merchant of Clazomenae. The main point of the story is found in Persius’ pun on the name Rex (king), which he cleverly links up with the propraetor and the propraetor’s most famous ancestor. The latter had driven out of Rome the ancient Tarquin kings, and Brutus himself had slain Caesar.</p>
<p>This little poem, similar, perhaps, to the farcical and dramatic scenes of early <span class="italic">Satura</span>, is probably the first of Horace’s <span class="italic">Sermones</span>, and must have been composed before the battle of Philippi (42 <span class="sc">b.c</span>), and the tragic death of Brutus.</p>
