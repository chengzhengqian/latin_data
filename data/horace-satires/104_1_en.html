<p>This is what I prayed for!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_211_a" id="target_note_LCL194_211_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—a piece of land not so very large, where there would be a garden, and near the house a spring of ever-flowing water, and up above these a bit of woodland. More and better than this have the gods done for me. I am content. Nothing more do I ask, O son of Maia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_211_b" id="target_note_LCL194_211_b"><sup>b</sup></a> save that thou make these blessings last my life long. If I have neither made my substance larger by evil ways, nor mean to make it smaller by excesses or neglect; if I offer up no such foolish prayers as these: “O if there could be added that near corner, which now spoils the shape of my little farm! O that some lucky strike would disclose to me a pot of money, like the man who, having found a treasure-trove, bought and ploughed the self-same ground he used to work on hire, enriched by favour of Hercules” !—if what I have gives me comfort and content, then thus I pray to thee: make fat the flocks I own, and all else save my wit, and, as thou art wont, still be my chief guardian!</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>So, now that from the city I have taken myself off to my castle in the hills, to what should I sooner give renown in the Satires of my prosaic Muse? Here no wretched place-hunting worries me to death, nor the leaden scirocco, nor sickly autumn, that brings gain to hateful Libitina.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_211_c" id="target_note_LCL194_211_c"><sup>c</sup></a></p>
