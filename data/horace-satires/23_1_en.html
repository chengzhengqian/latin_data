<p>Eupolis and Cratinus and Aristophanes, true poets,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_49_a" id="target_note_LCL194_49_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and the other good men to whom Old Comedy belongs, if there was anyone deserving to be drawn as a rogue and thief, as a rake or cut-throat, or as scandalous in any other way, set their mark upon him with great freedom. It is on these that Lucilius wholly hangs; these he has followed, changing only metre and rhythm. Witty he was, and of keen-scented nostrils, but harsh in framing his verse. Herein lay his fault: often in an hour, as though a great exploit, he would dictate two hundred lines while standing, as they say, on one foot.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_49_b" id="target_note_LCL194_49_b"><sup>b</sup></a> In his muddy stream there was much that you would like to remove. He was wordy, and too lazy to put up with the trouble of writing—of writing correctly, I mean; for as to quantity, I let that pass. See, Crispinus challenges me at long odds<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_49_ca" id="target_note_LCL194_49_ca"><sup>c</sup></a>: “Take your tablets, please; I’ll take mine. Let a place be fixed for us, and time and judges; let us see which can write the most.” The gods be praised for fashioning me of meagre wit and lowly spirit, of rare and scanty speech! But do you, for such is your taste, be like the air shut up in goat-skin bellows, and ever puffing away until the fire softens the iron.</p>
