<p>In view of <span class="italic">Caesaris invicti</span> of 1.11, it would seem that this Satire was written after the Battle of Actium, and therefore shortly before the publication of this Second Book in 30 <span class="sc">b.c</span>. Horace is now thirty-five years of age and has won recognition and an assured position in Roman literature. He no longer finds it necessary to defend his satire very seriously, but, as Lejay, in his introduction to this Satire, has clearly shown, “the legal conditions under which satire could be produced in the Augustan age formed a very real restriction upon the freedom of speech traditional in satire. . . . There is a touch of serious anxiety beneath the jest upon the <span class="italic">mala</span> and <span class="italic">bona carmina</span> with which the Satire closes” (Fiske, <span class="italic">Lucilius and Horace</span>, p. 370).</p>
