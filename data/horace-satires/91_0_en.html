from his fragments that Lucilius handled the same topic, and we find among the titles of Varro’s <span class="italic">Menippean Satires</span> that of Περὶ ἐδεσμάτων. It is probable therefore that Horace is simply trying his hand upon a traditional satiric theme.</p>
<p>But it is possible that the Satire has a greater significance than this. In the preceding Satire Horace deals in his own humorous fashion with the Stoics; in this he seems to be playing with the Epicureans. In the concluding verses the reference to Lucretius is unmistakable, while scattered through the Satire are philosophical terms, such as <span class="italic">natura</span> (7, 21, 45, 64), <span class="italic">praecepta</span> (11), <span class="italic">ratio</span> (36), and <span class="italic">ingenium</span> (47), which are conspicuous in Lucretius’s great poem. Palmer can see no reference to Epicureanism here, because Horace was himself an Epicurean, but Horace was never firmly wedded to any school. He was a free lance,</p>

Even Metrodorus, intimate friend of Epicurus, is reported to have said that “it is our business, not to seek crowns by saving the Greeks, but to enjoy ourselves in good eating and drinking” (Plutarch, <span class="italic">Adv. Col</span>. 1125 <span class="sc">d</span>).</p>
<p>As to Catius, the scholiasts tell us that he was an Epicurean and (like Lucretius) the author of a <span class="italic">De rerum natura</span>, but in commenting on 1.47 they also refer to another Catius who had written a book on the baker’s art. There is a Catius, an Insubrian and an
