<p><sup>21</sup>Happy fellow, Fannius, who has delivered his books and bust unasked!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_51_a" id="target_note_LCL194_51_a"><sup>a</sup></a> My writings no one reads, and I fear to recite them in public, the fact being that this style<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_51_b" id="target_note_LCL194_51_b"><sup>b</sup></a> is abhorrent to some, inasmuch as most people merit censure. Choose anyone from amid a crowd: he is suffering either from avarice or some wretched ambition. One is mad with love for somebody’s wife, another for boys. Here is one whose fancy the sheen of silver catches; Albius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_51_c" id="target_note_LCL194_51_c"><sup>c</sup></a> dotes on bronzes; another trades his wares from the rising sun to regions warmed by his evening rays; nay, through perils he rushes headlong, like dust gathered up by a whirlwind, fearful lest he lose aught of his total, or fail to add to his wealth. All of these dread verses and detest the poet: “He carries hay on his horns,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_51_d" id="target_note_LCL194_51_d"><sup>d</sup></a> give him a wide berth. Provided he can raise a laugh for himself, he will spare not a single friend, and whatever he has once scribbled on his sheets he will rejoice to have all know, all the slaves and old dames as they come home from bakehouse and pond.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL194_51_e" id="target_note_LCL194_51_e"><sup>e</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>38</sup>Come now, listen to a few words in answer. First I will take my own name from the list of such as I would allow to be poets. For you would not call it enough to round off a verse, nor would you count anyone poet who writes, as I do, lines more
