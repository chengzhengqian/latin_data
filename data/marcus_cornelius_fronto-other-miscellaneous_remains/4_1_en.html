<p><span class="italic">Inimicitia</span> Q. Ennius has, in fact, used in that constantly-quoted book of his:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">With such a character did Nature me endow</span>,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">Friendship and enmity I bear upon my brow</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_257_1" id="target_note_LCL113_257_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>But indeed, I beseech you, who else has either written or said that <span class="italic">arenae</span> is bad Latin? And therefore I beg that, if Caesar’s book be in your possession, you should bid it be brought, that you may jadge how positively he says this.”</p>
<p>4. On the first book <span class="italic">On Analogy</span> being produced, I committed to memory these few words from it. For after remarking that neither <span class="italic">caelum</span> nor <span class="italic">triticum</span> nor <span class="italic">arena</span> admits of a plural meaning, he<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_257_2" id="target_note_LCL113_257_2"><sup>2</sup></a> goes on, <span class="italic">Do you think that it results from the nature of these things, that we speak of one land and many lands, and of a city and cities, and of an empire and empires, but cannot reduce “quadtigae” to a noun of singular number nor convert “arena “into a term signifying plurality?</span></p>
<p>5. After reading these words Fronto said to the poet:</p>
<p>“Are you satisfied that C. Caesar has decided against you clearly and firmly enough as to the status of the word?”</p>
<p>Then the poet, impressed by the authoritative nature of the book, said: “If there were the right of appeal from Caesar, I would now appeal from this book of Caesar’s. But since he has himself omitted to give any reason for his verdict, I ask you now to tell us what fault you think there is in saying either <span class="italic">quadriga</span> or <span class="italic">arenae</span>.”</p>
