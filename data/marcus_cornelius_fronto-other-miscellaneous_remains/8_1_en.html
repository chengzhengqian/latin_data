<p>2. Then Fronto said to Favorinus:</p>
<p>“We do not go as far as to deny that the Greek language, in which you seem to be well-read, is more comprehensive and copious than our own: still in designating those colours which you have just mentioned, we are not so poorly off as you seem to suppose. For, in fact, those words which you lately mentioned, <span class="italic">rufus</span> and <span class="italic">ruber</span>, are not our only ones to denote the colour <span class="italic">red</span>; but we have others besides and more than the Greek ones mentioned by you. For <span class="italic">fulvus</span> and <span class="italic">flavus</span> and <span class="italic">rubidus</span> and <span class="italic">phoeniceus</span> and <span class="italic">rutilus</span> and <span class="italic">luteus</span> and <span class="italic">spadix</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_265_1" id="target_note_LCL113_265_1"><sup>1</sup></a> are designations of the colour red, either intensifying it, as if firing it, or blending it with green, or deepening it with black, or softly brightening it with greenish white.</p>
<p>3. “For <span class="italic">pkoeniceus</span>, which you mentioned in its Greek form φοῖνιξ, is a word of our own, and <span class="italic">rutilus</span>, and <span class="italic">spadix</span>, which is synonymous with <span class="italic">phoeniceus</span>—a word that, though Greek by origin, is naturalized with us—signifies the richness and brilliance of red, such as it appears in the fruit of the palm-tree when not very much burnt by the sun; and hence come the words <span class="italic">spadix</span> and <span class="italic">phoeniceus</span>. For the Dorians call a branch with fruit broken off from the palm-tree a <span class="italic">spadix</span>.</p>
<p>4. “<span class="italic">Fulvus</span>, however, seems to be a blend of red and green, in which sometimes the one colour, sometimes the other, predominates: as a poet, the most careful in his choice of words, calls an eagle <span class="italic">fulvus</span>, and jasper and wolfskin caps and gold, and sand
