<h2>Fronto’s Salutation to Hadrian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_251_1" id="target_note_LCL113_251_1"><sup>1</sup></a></h2>
<p>? <span class="italic">About</span> 136 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Cornelius Fronto</span>, who held the first place at the bar among the Romans of that day, was returning home on one occasion very late in the evening from a banquet, and learning from one for whom he had promised to plead that Hadrian was sitting in court, he went in as he was in his banqueting dress to the court and saluted him, not with the morning salutation χαῖρε but with the evening one ὐγίαινε.</p>

<h2>From the Speech on the War in Britain</h2>
<p>140–1 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Fronto</span>, not the second but the alternative glory of Roman eloquence, when he was giving the emperor Antoninus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_251_2" id="target_note_LCL113_251_2"><sup>2</sup></a> praise for the successful completion of the war in Britain,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_251_3" id="target_note_LCL113_251_3"><sup>3</sup></a> declared that although he had committed the conduct of the campaign to others, while sitting at home himself in the Palace at Rome, yet like the helmsman at the tiller of a ship of war, the glory of the whole navigation and voyage belonged to him.</p>

It was a new day to the court, but the end of Fronto’s day. Hence his use of the evening salutation. For the difference between χαῖρε, “Good cheer” (our “Good morning,” or “How do you do?”), and ὑγίαινε, “Vale” (our “Good night,” or “Good-bye”), see Lucian, <span class="italic">Pro Lapsu in Salutando</span>, i., where a mistake in the use of these expressions is illustrated at length.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL113_251_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL113_251_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL113_251_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Pius.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL113_251_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note inline" id="note_LCL113_251_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL113_251_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>140 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL113_251_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
