<p>“You are quit indeed of the disease, but of defect in diction you are not quit. For Gaius Caesar, the father-in-law of Gnaeus Pompeius, he who was dictator for life, from whom the family and designation of the Caesars are derived and still continue, a man of preeminent genius and distinguished beyond all his contemporaries for purity of style, in those books which he wrote to Cicero <span class="italic">On Analogy</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_255_1" id="target_note_LCL113_255_1"><sup>1</sup></a> holds that <span class="italic">arenae</span> is a faulty locution, in that <span class="italic">arena</span> is never used in the plural any more than <span class="italic">caelum</span> or <span class="italic">triticum</span>;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL113_255_2" id="target_note_LCL113_255_2"><sup>2</sup></a> but his opinion is that <span class="italic">quadrigae</span>, on the other hand, although a single chariot is a single team of horses yoked together, should always be spoken of in the plural number, just as <span class="italic">arma</span> and <span class="italic">moenia</span> and <span class="italic">comitia</span> and <span class="italic">inimicitiae</span>: unless, my most brilliant of poets, you have anything to say to the contrary that shall clear you and prove that you were not in fault.”</p>
<p>3. “As to <span class="italic">caelum</span>,” said the other, “and <span class="italic">triticum</span>, I do not deny that they should always be used in the singular number; nor as to <span class="italic">arma</span> and <span class="italic">moenia</span> and <span class="italic">comitia</span> that they should be regarded as invariably plural words: about <span class="italic">inimicitiae</span> and <span class="italic">quadrigae</span>, however, we will consider later; and possibly as to the latter I shall bow to the authority of the ancients. But what grounds has C. Caesar for supposing that <span class="italic">inimicitia</span> was not used by the ancients and cannot be used by us, just as much as <span class="italic">scientia</span> and <span class="italic">impotentia</span> and <span class="italic">iniuria</span>? since Plautus, the glory of the Latin tongue, has used <span class="italic">delicia</span> also in the singular number for <span class="italic">deliciae</span>:</p>
