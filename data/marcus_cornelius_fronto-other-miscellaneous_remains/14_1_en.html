that the meaning was as a rule rather tangled than unravelled by the grammarians. So he desired the <span class="italic">Iphigenia</span> of Q. Ennius to be brought forthwith; and in a chorus of that tragedy we read these lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">He who can use not ease more labour has</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">Than when his labour in his labour lies</span>.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">For he who does what he has planned makes it</span></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">No labour; heart and mind delight therein</span>:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">In idle ease the heart knows not its wish</span>.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">So we: at home we are not nor abroad</span>;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">This way we go, then that; no sooner come</span>,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">We wish to go elsewhere; we vacillate</span>,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line"><span class="italic">And live but there or thereabout our life</span>.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>“Do you hear, excellent master, that your friend Ennius has used <span class="italic">praeter propter</span>, and in a sentiment as dignified as the severest scolding by philosophers could be? We beg you, therefore, since we are enquiring about a word used by Ennius, to tell us what is held to be the meaning of this verse:</p>
<p><span class="italic">Incerte errai animus, praeter propter vitam vivitur</span>.”</p>
<p>And the grammarian, sweating profusely and blushing profusely, as most of us were laughing heartily at his dilemma, got up and, as he went out, said, “I will give you an answer some time when you are alone, as I do not wish the more ignorant listeners to hear and profit by what I say.”</p>
<p>After this we all rose up, leaving the discussion of the word there.</p>
