Though dignity be the crown of age and strength, by a far different lot, of youth, yet either season decks thee with its own peculiar honours. Thou art the ornament of fortune. Never tookst thou up the sword for hurt nor ever didst steep its blade in citizens’ blood. No cruelties on thy part aroused men’s hatred; favouritism never slacks the reins of justice. We love thee, yet we fear thee. Our very fear testifies to our love, O thou most righteous interpreter of Law, guardian most sure of peace with honour, greatest of our generals, most blessed among the fathers of our country.

Crown thy head with a garland, lay aside thy rank for a moment and join our dances. An thou dost this, so may thy son Eucherius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL135_267_1" id="target_note_LCL135_267_1"><sup>1</sup></a> surpass the virtues of his sire; so may the fair Thermantia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL135_267_1" id="target_note_LCL135_267_1"><sup>1</sup></a> thy daughter, live to see a marriage such as this; so may Maria’s womb grow big and a little Honorius, born in the purple, rest on his grandsire’s lap.”</p>
