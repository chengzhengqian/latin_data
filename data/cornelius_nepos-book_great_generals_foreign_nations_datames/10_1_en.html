When he had received that pledge from the king’s messenger,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL467_163_1" id="target_note_LCL467_163_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Mithridates prepared his forces and made friends with Datames without meeting him. He then began to raid the king’s provinces and storm his fortresses, gaining a great amount of booty, of which he divided a part among his soldiers and sent a part to Datames; he likewise handed over several fortresses to the Carian. By continuing this conduct for a long time he convinced Datames that he was engaged in implacable war against the king, while nevertheless, to avoid exciting any suspicion of treachery, he neither sought an interview with his intended victim, nor did he try to meet him face to face. From a distance he played the part of a friend, in such a way that they seemed to be united, not by mutual services, but by the common hatred which they felt for the king.</p>

The proposition was accepted, and a time and place appointed for their meeting. Mithridates went to the spot several days in advance, with a single companion in whom he had the greatest confidence; and in several different places, which he carefully marked, he buried swords. And on the very day of the meeting both parties sent men to examine the place and search the generals themselves; then the two met. </p>
