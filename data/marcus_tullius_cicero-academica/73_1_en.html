have discovered something that resembles truth? But just as I deem it supremely honourable to hold true views, so it is supremely disgraceful to approve falsehoods as true. And nevertheless I myself am not the sort of person never to give approval to anything false, never give absolute assent, never hold an opinion; it is the wise man that we are investigating. For my own part however, although I am a great opinion-holder<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_551_a" id="target_note_LCL268_551_a"><sup>a</sup></a> (for I am not a wise man), at the same time the way in which I steer my thinking is not by that tiny star, the Cynosure, in which</p>
