of encountering some terrifying external object, with nothing to distinguish between the two kinds of shivering and pallor, and without any difference between the internal state of feeling and the one that came from without. Lastly, if no false presentations at all are probable, it is another story; but if some are, why are not even those that are difficult to distinguish? why not those that are so much like true ones that there is absolutely no difference between them? especially as you yourselves say that the wise man when in a state of frenzy restrains himself from all assent because no distinction between presentations is visible to him.</p>

And as a first point one must criticize them for employing an exceedingly captious kind of argument, of a sort that is usually by no means approved of in philosophy—the method of proceeding by minute steps of gradual addition or withdrawal.

It is certainly an erroneous and captious kind of argument! for you go on mounting up in this way: ‘If a presentation put by the deity before a man asleep is of such a character that it is probable, why not also of such a character that it is extremely like a true one? then, why not such that it can with difficulty be distinguished from a true one? then, that it cannot even be distinguished? finally, that there is no difference between the one and the other?’
