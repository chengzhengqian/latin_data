syllogism and the former one—‘If you are lying, you are lying; but you are lying; therefore you are lying’? You say that you are unable either to agree to this or to disprove it; how then are you more able to deal with the other? if science, reason, method, in fact if the syllogistic proof is valid, it is the <span class="innerMarginNote left">97</span> same in either case. But the farthest length they go is to demand that these insoluble problems should be deemed an exception. My advice to them is to apply to some tribune<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_591_a" id="target_note_LCL268_591_a"><sup>a</sup></a>: they will never get that ‘saving clause’ from me.
