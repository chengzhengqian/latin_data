Nevertheless, assuming the truth of the positions discussed, all talk whatever about assent is beside the mark; for he who perceives anything assents immediately. But there also follow<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_517_a" id="target_note_LCL268_517_a"><sup>a</sup></a> the points that without assent memory, and mental concepts of objects, and sciences, are impossible; and most important of all, granting that some freedom of the will exists, none will exist in one who assents to nothing; where then is virtue, if nothing rests with ourselves? <span class="innerMarginNote left">39</span> And what is most absurd is that men’s vices should be in their own power and that nobody should sin except with assent, but that the same should not be true in the case of virtue, whose sole consistency and strength is constituted by the things to which it has given its assent and so to say approval.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_517_b" id="target_note_LCL268_517_b"><sup>b</sup></a> And speaking generally, before we act it is essential for us to experience some presentation, and for our assent to be given to the presentation; therefore one who abolishes either presentation or assent abolishes all action out of life.</p>

Well, they begin by constructing a ‘science of presentations’ (as we render the term), and define their nature and classes, and in particular the nature of that which can be perceived and grasped,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_517_d" id="target_note_LCL268_517_d"><sup>d</sup></a> at as great a length as do the Stoics.
