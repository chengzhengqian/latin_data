and unreal ones? The same applies to dreams.

Even men acting under the influence of wine do not act with the same decision as they do when sober: they are doubtful and hesitating and sometimes pull themselves up, and they give a more feeble assent to their sense-presentations and, when they have slept it off, realize how unsubstantial those presentations were. The same happens to the insane: at the beginning of their attack they are conscious that they are mad, and say that something is appearing to them that is not real; and also when the attack is subsiding they are conscious of it, and say things like the words of Alcmaeon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_533_c" id="target_note_LCL268_533_c"><sup>c</sup></a>:</p>
