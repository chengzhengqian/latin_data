as they are in the habit of saying, towards the actual truth, or indeed come as near to it as possible. For to enable them to trust their judgement, it will be necessary for the characteristic mark of truth to be known to them, and if this be obscured and suppressed, what truth pray will they suppose that they attain to? What language moreover could be more absurd than their formula, ‘It is true that this is a token or a proof of yonder object, and therefore I follow it, but it is possible that the object that it indicates may be either false<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_515_a" id="target_note_LCL268_515_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or entirely non-existent’? But enough on the subject of perception; for if anybody desires to upset the doctrines stated, truth will easily conduct her own defence, even if we decline the brief.</p>

For while we were explaining<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_515_c" id="target_note_LCL268_515_c"><sup>c</sup></a> the power residing in the senses, it was at the same time disclosed that many things are grasped and perceived by the senses, which cannot happen without the act of assent. Again, as the greatest difference between an inanimate and an animate object is that an animate object performs some action (for an entirely inactive animal is an utterly inconceivable thing), either it must be denied the possession of sensation or it must be assigned a faculty of assenting as a <span class="innerMarginNote left">38</span> voluntary act. But on the other hand persons who refuse to exercise either sensation or assent are in a manner robbed of the mind itself; for as the scale of a balance must necessarily sink when weights are put in it, so the mind must necessarily yield to clear
