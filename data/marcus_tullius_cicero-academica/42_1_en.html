many years gave his attention to Clitomachus; and while Philo lived the Academy did not lack advocacy. But the undertaking upon which we are now entering, the refutation of the Academics, was entirely ruled out by some of the philosophers, and those indeed men of no inconsiderable standing, and they held that there was really no sense in arguing with thinkers who sanctioned nothing as proved, and they criticized the Stoic Antipater for spending much time in this; and they also asserted that there was no need to define the essential nature of knowledge or perception or (if we wish to give a literal translation) ‘mental grasp,’ the Stoic term <span class="italic">catalēpsis</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_489_a" id="target_note_LCL268_489_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and maintained that those who tried to prove that there is something that can be grasped and perceived were acting unscientifically, because there was nothing clearer than <span class="italic">enargeia</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_489_b" id="target_note_LCL268_489_b"><sup>b</sup></a> (as the Greeks call it: let us term it perspicuousness or evidentness, if you will, and let us manufacture terms if necessary, so as not to let our friend here”—this was a jocular shot at me—“think that he has a monopoly of this licence): well, they thought that no argument could be discovered that was clearer than evidentness itself, and they deemed that truths so manifest did not need defining.
