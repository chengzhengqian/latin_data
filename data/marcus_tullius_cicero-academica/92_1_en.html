<p>XXX. “But I drop this point and ask the following question: if the problems in question are insoluble and no criterion of them is forthcoming to enable you to answer whether they are true or false, what becomes of the definition of a ‘proposition’ as ‘that which is either true or false’? Taking certain premisses I will draw the conclusion that, of two sets of propositions, to be classed as contradictory, one set is to be adopted and the other set to be rejected.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_589_b" id="target_note_LCL268_589_b"><sup>b</sup></a> <span class="innerMarginNote left">96</span> What judgement do you pass on the procedure of the following syllogism—‘If you say that it is light now and speak the truth, it is light; but you do say that it is light now and speak the truth; therefore it is light’?
