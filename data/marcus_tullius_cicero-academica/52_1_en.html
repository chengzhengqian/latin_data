or what they mean. For sometimes when we address them in this sort of language, ‘If your contentions are true, then everything will be uncertain,’ they reply, ‘Well, what has that to do with us? surely it is not our fault; blame nature for having hidden truth quite away, in an abyss, as Democritus says.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_509_b" id="target_note_LCL268_509_b"><sup>b</sup></a> But others make a more elaborate answer, and actually complain because we charge them with saying that everything is uncertain, and they try to explain the difference between what is uncertain and what cannot be grasped, and to distinguish between them. Let us therefore deal with those who make this distinction, and leave on one side as a hopeless sort of persons the others who say that all things are as uncertain as whether the number of the stars is odd or even. For they hold (and this in fact, I noticed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_509_c" id="target_note_LCL268_509_c"><sup>c</sup></a> excites your school extremely) that something is ‘probable,’ or as it were<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_509_d" id="target_note_LCL268_509_d"><sup>d</sup></a> resembling the truth, and that this provides them with a canon of judgement both in the conduct of life and in philosophical investigation and discussion.</p>

if we have no notion of truth and falsehood, for the reason that they are indistinguishable? For if we have a notion of them, there must be a difference between true and false, just as there is between right and wrong; if there is none, there is no canon, and the man who has a presentation of the true and the
