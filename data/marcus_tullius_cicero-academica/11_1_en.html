wisest of all men,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_427_a" id="target_note_LCL268_427_a"><sup>a</sup></a> because all wisdom consists solely in not thinking that you know what you do not know. He used to say this regularly, and remained firm in this opinion, yet nevertheless the whole of his discourses were spent in praising virtue and in exhorting mankind to the zealous pursuit of virtue, as can be gathered from the books of members of the Socratic <span class="innerMarginNote left">17</span> school, and particularly from those of Plato. But originating with Plato, a thinker of manifold variety and fertility, there was established a philosophy that, though it had two appellations, was really a single uniform system, that of the Academic and the Peripatetic schools, which while agreeing in doctrine differed in name; for Plato left his sister’s son Speusippus as ‘heir’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_427_b" id="target_note_LCL268_427_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to his system, but two pupils of outstanding zeal and learning, Xenocrates, a native of Calchedon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_427_c" id="target_note_LCL268_427_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and Aristotle, a native of Stagira<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_427_d" id="target_note_LCL268_427_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; and accordingly the associates of Aristotle were called the Peripatetics, because they used to debate while walking in the Lyceum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_427_e" id="target_note_LCL268_427_e"><sup>e</sup></a> while the others, because they carried on Plato’s practice of assembling and conversing in the Academy, which is another gymnasium, got their appellation from the name of the place.

Thus was produced something that Socrates had been in the habit of reprobating entirely, a definite science of philosophy, with a regular arrangement of subjects and a formulated <span class="innerMarginNote left">18</span> system of doctrine.
