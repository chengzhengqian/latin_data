adduce he has to apply practice: just as a mother knows her twins apart by having familiarized her eyes, so you will know them apart if you habituate yourself. Are you aware that the likeness of one egg to another is proverbial? yet we have been told that at Delos at the time of its prosperity a number of people were in the habit of keeping large numbers of hens for trade purposes; these poultry-keepers used to be able to tell which hen had laid an egg by merely <span class="innerMarginNote left">58</span> looking at it. Nor does that go against us, for we are content not to be able to know those eggs apart, since to agree that this egg is the same as that egg, is nevertheless not the same thing as if there really <span class="italic">were</span> no distinction between them; for I possess a standard enabling me to judge presentations to be true when they have a character of a sort that false ones could not have; from that standard I may not diverge a finger’s breadth, as the saying is, lest I should cause universal confusion. For not only the knowledge but even the nature of true and false will be done away with if there is no difference between them, so that even the remark that you have a way of occasionally making will be absurd—namely, that what you assert is not that when presentations are impressed on to the mind there is no difference between the imprints themselves, but that there is no difference between their ‘species,’ or so to say their class-forms.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_541_a" id="target_note_LCL268_541_a"><sup>a</sup></a> As if forsooth presentations were not judged with reference to their class, and will have no reliability if the mark of truth and falsehood is <span class="innerMarginNote left">59</span> abolished! But the height of absurdity is your assertion<span class="marginNote right">The logical result of this theory is ‘suspense of judgement.’</span>
that you follow probabilities if nothing hampers you. In the first place how can you be unhampered when there is no difference between true presentations
