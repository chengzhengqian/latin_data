they do not persuade but convince, and who prove all their propositions by their diagrams to the satisfaction of your school. I am not asking these people about those first principles of mathematics which must be granted before they are able to advance an inch—that a point is a thing without magnitude, that a ‘boundary’ or surface<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_617_a" id="target_note_LCL268_617_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is a thing entirely devoid of thickness, a line a thing without any breadth. When I have admitted the correctness of these definitions, if I put the wise man on his oath, and not until Archimedes has first, with him looking on, drawn all the diagrams proving that the sun is many times as large as the earth, do you think that he will take the oath? If he does, he will have shown contempt for the sun itself which he deems is a <span class="innerMarginNote left">117</span> god. But if he is going to refuse credence to the methods of geometry, which in their teaching exercise a compelling force, as your school itself asserts, surely he for his part will be far from believing the proofs of the philosophers; or else, if he does believe them, which school’s proofs will he choose? for one might set out all the systems of the natural philosophers, but it would be a long story: all the same, I want to know which philosopher he follows. Imagine that somebody is becoming a wise man now, but is not one yet; what doctrine or system will he select to adopt? although whichever one he does select, the selection will be made by a man not wise; but suppose he be an inspired genius, which single one among the natural philosophers will he choose to approve? more than one he will not be able to. I am not asking about problems of unlimited vagueness: let us merely consider what authority he will approve in respect of the elements
