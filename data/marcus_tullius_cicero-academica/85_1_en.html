Geminus Quintus to appear to you, what reason have you for being satisfied that a person who is not Cotta cannot appear to you to be Cotta, inasmuch as something that is not real appears to be real? You say that everything is in a class of its own,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_575_a" id="target_note_LCL268_575_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and that nothing is the same as what some other thing is. That is, it is true, a Stoic argument, and it is not a very convincing one—that no hair or grain of sand is in all respects the same as another hair or grain. These assertions can be refuted, but I don’t want to fight; for it makes no difference to the point at issue whether an object completely within sight does not differ at all from another or cannot be distinguished from it even if it does differ. But if so great a resemblance between human beings is impossible, is it also impossible between statues? Tell me, could not Lysippus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_575_b" id="target_note_LCL268_575_b"><sup>b</sup></a> by means of the same bronze, the same blend of metals, the same graver and all the other requisites, make a hundred Alexanders of the same shape? then by what mode of recognition would you tell them apart? <span class="innerMarginNote left">86</span> Well, if I imprint a hundred seals with this ring on lumps of wax of the same sort, will there possibly be any mode of distinction to aid in recognizing them? Or will you have to seek out some jeweller, as you found that poultry-keeper<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_575_c" id="target_note_LCL268_575_c"><sup>c</sup></a> at Delos who recognized eggs?</p>
<p>XXVII. But you call in the aid of art<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_575_d" id="target_note_LCL268_575_d"><sup>d</sup></a> to plead in defence even of the senses. A painter sees things that we do not, and a musical expert recognizes a tune as soon as a flute-player has blown a note. Well, does not this seem to tell against you, if without great artistic acquirements, to which few people, of our race indeed very few, attain, we are unable either to see or to hear? Again those were remarkable points<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_575_e" id="target_note_LCL268_575_e"><sup>e</sup></a> about the high artistic skill shown
