the dignity of the name in spite of abandoning the reality—for in fact some persons did aver that his motive was ostentation, and even that he hoped that his following would be styled the School of Antiochus. But I am more inclined to think that he was unable to withstand the united attack of all the philosophers (for although they have certain things in common on all other subjects, this is the one doctrine of the Academics that no one of the other schools approves); and accordingly he gave way, and, just like people who cannot bear the sun under the New Row,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_557_a" id="target_note_LCL268_557_a"><sup>a</sup></a> took refuge from the heat in the shade of the Old Academy, <span class="innerMarginNote left">71</span> as they do in the shadow of the Balconies.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_557_b" id="target_note_LCL268_557_b"><sup>b</sup></a> And as to the argument that he was in the habit of employing at the period when he held that nothing could be perceived, which consisted in asking which of his two doctrines had the famous Dionysius of Heraclea grasped by means of that unmistakable mark which according to your school ought to be the foundation of assent—the doctrine that he had held for many years and had accepted on the authority of his master Zeno, that only the morally honourable is good, or the doctrine that he had made a practice of defending afterwards, that morality is an empty name, and that the supreme good is pleasure?—in spite of Antiochus’s attempt to prove from Dionysius’s change of opinion that no impression can be printed on our minds by a true presentation of a character that cannot also be caused by a false one, he yet ensured that the argument which he himself had drawn from Dionysius should be drawn by everybody else from himself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_557_c" id="target_note_LCL268_557_c"><sup>c</sup></a> But with him I will deal more at length elsewhere; I turn now, Lucullus, to what was said by you.</p>
