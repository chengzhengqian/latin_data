But, you say, we don’t wish for more! What, do you think a mole doesn’t wish for light? And I should not quarrel with the deity so much about the limited range of my sight as about its inaccuracy. Do you see yonder ship? To us she appears to be at anchor, whereas to those on board her this house appears in motion. Seek for a reason for this appearance, and however much you succeed in finding one—though I doubt if you can—you will not have made out that you have got a true witness but that your witness is <span class="innerMarginNote left">82</span> for reasons of his own giving false evidence.</p>
<p>XXVI. Why do I talk about a ship? for I saw<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_571_a" id="target_note_LCL268_571_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that you think the illustration of the oar contemptible; perhaps you want bigger examples.

But to narrow down the controversy, pray see how small a point it is on which the issue turns.
