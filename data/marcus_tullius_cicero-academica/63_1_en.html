If you reach this conclusion owing to my yielding to you each successive step, the fault will have been mine; but if you get there of your own accord, it <span class="innerMarginNote left">50</span> will be yours. For who will have granted you either that the deity is omnipotent, or that even if he can do as described he will? and how do you make such assumptions that, if it is possible for <span class="italic">x</span> to resemble <span class="italic">y</span>, it will follow that only with difficulty can <span class="italic">x</span> and <span class="italic">y</span> be known apart? and then, that they cannot even be known apart? and finally, that they are identical? for example, if wolves are like dogs, you will end by saying that they are identical.
