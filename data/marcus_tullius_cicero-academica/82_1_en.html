an eye, since it is a lie of the opinion, not of the eyes. As though the question were what exists, not what seems to exist! However, Timagoras may be allowed to be true to his intellectual ancestry; but as for you, who say that some sense-presentations are true and some false, how do you distinguish them apart? And do pray desist from mere stock arguments: those are products we have a home supply of! If a god, you say, were to inquire of you whether, given healthy and sound senses, you want anything more, what would you reply? Indeed I wish he would make the inquiry! he would be told how badly he was dealing with us! For even granting that our sight is accurate, how wide is its range? I can make out Catulus’s place at Cumae from where we are, and can see it straight in front of me, but I can’t make out his villa at Pompei, although there is nothing in between to block the view, but my sight is not able to carry any further. O what a glorious view! We can see Puteoli, but we can’t see our friend Gaius Avianius, who is very likely taking a <span class="innerMarginNote left">81</span> stroll in the Colonnade of Neptune<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_569_a" id="target_note_LCL268_569_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; whereas that somebody or other who is regularly quoted in lectures used to see an object two hundred and twenty-five miles off,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_569_b" id="target_note_LCL268_569_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and certain birds can see further. Therefore I should boldly answer that deity of your friends that I am by no means satisfied with the eyes that I have got. He will say that my sight is keener than that of the fishes down there, very likely, which we cannot see though they are under our eyes at the very moment, and which also themselves cannot see us above them; it follows that we are shut in by an opaque envelope of air as they are by one of water.
