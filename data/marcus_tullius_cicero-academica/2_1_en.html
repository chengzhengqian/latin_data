Cumae, with Pomponius as one of the party; I have cast you for the part of champion of Antiochus, whose doctrine I think I have understood you to approve of, while I have taken the r√¥le of Philo myself.

And would that we had the power to carry on these joint studies in a period of tranquillity, and with the affairs of state settled in some definite if not satisfactory manner! although in that case indeed perhaps certain other interests would afford us honourable subjects of thought and honourable fields of action; whereas now without our present studies what reason have we to wish to be alive?
