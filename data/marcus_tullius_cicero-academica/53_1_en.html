false that is common to both<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_511_a" id="target_note_LCL268_511_a"><sup>a</sup></a> cannot have any criterion or any mark of truth at all. For when they say that they only remove the possibility of anything<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_511_b" id="target_note_LCL268_511_b"><sup>b</sup></a> presenting an appearance of such a sort that a false thing could not present the same appearance, but that they allow everything else, they act childishly. Having abolished the means by which all things are judged, they say they do not abolish the remaining sources of knowledge; just as if anybody were to say that when he has deprived a man of his eyes he has not taken away from that man the possible objects of sight. For just as the objects of sight are recognized only by means of the eyes, so everything else is recognized by means of sense-presentations; but they are recognized by a mark that belongs specially to what is true, and is not common to the true and the false. Therefore if you bring forward ‘probable presentation,’ or ‘probable and unhampered presentation,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_511_ca" id="target_note_LCL268_511_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> as Carneades held, or something else, as a guide for you to follow, you will have to come back to the sense-presentation that we <span class="innerMarginNote left">34</span> are dealing with. But if this has community with a false presentation, it will contain no standard of judgement, because a special property cannot be indicated by a common mark; while if on the contrary there is nothing in common between them, I have got what I want, for I am looking for a thing that may appear to me so true that it could not appear to me in the same way if it were false. They are involved in the same mistake when under stress of truth’s upbraiding they desire to distinguish between things perceived and things perspicuous, and try to prove that there is such a thing as something perspicuous which although
