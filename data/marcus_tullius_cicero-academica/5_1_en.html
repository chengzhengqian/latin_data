philosophy had been most carefully expounded in Greek treatises, I judged that any persons from our nation that felt an interest in the subject, if they were learned in the teachings of the Greeks, would sooner read Greek writings than ours, and if on the other hand they shrank from the sciences and systems of the Greeks, they would not care even for philosophy, which cannot be understood without Greek learning: and therefore I was unwilling to write what the unlearned would not be able to understand and the learned would not take the trouble to read. <span class="innerMarginNote left">5</span>But you are aware (for you have passed through the<span class="marginNote right">Logic</span>

The speaker here touches on the three accepted departments of philosophy in their established order, Logic, Physics, Ethics, which study respectively the questions, how we know the facts of the world, what those facts are, and consequently what conduct will secure our welfare? ‘Physics’ for the ancients has not the limited sense that the term bears now, but denotes the whole of Natural Science, including Biology, which is indeed specially suggested by the term, as φύεσθαι often means ‘to grow,’ of a living organism.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL268_415_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL268_415_ba"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL268_415_ba" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup><span class="italic">Interrogatio</span> is a synonym for <span class="italic">ratio</span>, and renders ἐρώτημα, properly denoting an argument developed in a series of questions, but also used for any form of proof, σπόδειξις. <span class="italic">Concludere</span>=συλλογίζεσθαι, denoting logical inference, and specially deduction.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL268_415_ba').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
