truth is discerned. The school of Elis taught a similar doctrine, but I believe they expounded it in <span class="innerMarginNote left">130</span> a more copious and ornate style. If we look down on these philosophers and think them out of date, we are undoubtedly bound to feel less contempt for the following: Aristo, who, having been a disciple of Zeno, proved in practice what his master established in theory, that nothing is good except virtue, and nothing evil unless it is contrary to virtue; those motives of action which Zeno held to exist in things intermediate he deemed to be non-existent.
