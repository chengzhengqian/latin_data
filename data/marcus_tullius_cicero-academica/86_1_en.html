in Nature’s fabrication of our senses and mind and <span class="innerMarginNote left">87</span> the whole structure of a human being. Why should I not be extremely afraid of rashness in forming opinion? Can you even assert this, Lucullus, that there is some force, united I suppose with providence<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_577_a" id="target_note_LCL268_577_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and design, that has moulded or, to use your word,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_577_b" id="target_note_LCL268_577_b"><sup>b</sup></a> fabricated a human being? What sort of workmanship is that? where was it applied? when? why? how? You handle these matters cleverly, and expound them in a style that is even elegant; well then, let us grant that they <span class="italic">appear</span>, only provided that they are not affirmed. But with the natural philosophers we will deal soon (and that with the object of saving you, who said just now<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_577_c" id="target_note_LCL268_577_c"><sup>c</sup></a> that I should go to them, from <span class="italic">appearing</span> to have told a falsehood); whereas, to come to matters less obscure, I will now pour forth the facts of the universe, about which volumes have been filled not only by our school but also by Chrysippus; of whom the Stoics are in the habit of complaining that, while he carefully sought out all the facts that told against the senses and their clarity and against the whole of common experience and against reason, when answering himself he got the worst of it, and thus it was he that furnished <span class="innerMarginNote left">88</span> weapons to Carneades. My points are of the sort<span class="marginNote right">Hallucinations are real while they last.</span>
that have been handled very industriously by you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_577_d" id="target_note_LCL268_577_d"><sup>d</sup></a> Your assertion was that presentations seen by people asleep and tipsy and mad are feebler than those of persons awake and sober and sane. How? Because, you said, when Ennius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_577_e" id="target_note_LCL268_577_e"><sup>e</sup></a> had woken up he did not say that he had seen Homer but that he had seemed to see him, while his Alcmaeon says</p>
