of your remark at the beginning,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_559_a" id="target_note_LCL268_559_a"><sup>a</sup></a> that our way of recalling ancient philosophers was like the seditionmongers’ habit of putting forward the names of persons who are men of distinction but yet of popular leanings. Those people although they have unworthy designs in hand desire to appear like men of worth; and we in our turn declare that the views we hold are ones that you yourselves admit to have been approved by the noblest of philosophers. Anaxagoras said<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_559_b" id="target_note_LCL268_559_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that snow is black: would you endure me if I said the same? Not you, not even if I expressed myself as doubtful. But who is this Anaxagoras? surely not a sophist (for that is the name that used to be given to people who pursued philosophy for the sake of display or profit)? Why, he was a man <span class="innerMarginNote left">73</span> of the highest renown for dignity and intellect. Why should I talk about Democritus? Whom can we compare for not only greatness of intellect but also greatness of soul, with one who dared to begin, ‘These are my utterances about the universe’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_559_c" id="target_note_LCL268_559_c"><sup>c</sup></a>?—he excepts nothing as not covered by his pronouncement, for what can be outside the universe? Who does not place this philosopher before Cleanthes or Chrysippus or the rest of the later period, who compared with him seem to me to belong to the fifth class<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_559_da" id="target_note_LCL268_559_da"><sup>d</sup></a>? And he does not mean what we mean, who do not deny that some truth exists but deny that it can be perceived; he flatly denies that truth exists at all; and at the same time says that the senses are (not dim but) ‘full of darkness’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL268_559_e" id="target_note_LCL268_559_e"><sup>e</sup></a>—for that is the term he uses
