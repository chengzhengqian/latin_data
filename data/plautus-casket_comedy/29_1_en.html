<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lam</span><p class="lineGroup">I continued to weigh her down with my words: “That
old woman is inviting you from a good fortune to a
wretched one; she’s your nurse, in case you believe she’s
your mother. I’m taking and inviting you back to greatest
wealth, where you’ll be placed into a splendid family,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">560</span><span class="br"></span>
from where your father will give you twenty Attic talents
of dowry; that’s definitely not the case here, where you’d
earn your dowry yourself with your body, in a manner unworthy
of yourself, in the Tuscan way.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL061_189_14" id="target_note_LCL061_189_14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></div>

already winning her over to my side with my persuasive
speech; the old woman clasped her knees, crying and entreating
her not to leave her: she gave me a solemn oath
that she was her daughter, and that she’d given birth to
her. “The girl you’re looking for,” she said, “I gave to a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">570</span><span class="br"></span>
friend of mine to bring up as her own daughter; and she’s
alive,” she said. “Where is she?” I asked at once.</p></div>
