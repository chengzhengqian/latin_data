Fr. iv still belongs to the preceding scene; Gymnasium has made
the old man fall in love with her.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL061_171_8a" id="target_note_LCL061_171_8a"><sup>8</sup></a> Then Gymnasium’s mother
comes to take her back since Alcesimarchus is back in town and
can look after his house himself. In fr. v the procuress addresses
the old man, who understands what has been going on and
leaves. Fr. vi–viii are from the ensuing dialogue between the
procuress and Gymnasium, unless fr. vi still belongs to the old
man, who could be addressing the procuress. Fr. vii and viii
clearly belong together. Gymnasium and her mother return to
their house and Lampadio enters from the right, from his search
for the woman whom he had seen picking up Selenium. In fr. ix
he talks about good slaves remembering their duty and no doubt
considers himself to be one of them. In fr. x–xii he describes what
he saw during his search.</span></span></div>
