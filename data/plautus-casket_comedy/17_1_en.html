<p class="noindent">Around seventy lines have been lost between ll. 304 and 306.
Alcesimarchus and his servant go looking for the young man’s
father. In the following scene, this old man comes to the house of
Alcesimarchus in order to tell Selenium that she should leave his
son alone. He meets Gymnasium and mistakes her for Selenium;
Gymnasium enjoys the misunderstanding. Fr. iii belongs to this
scene, but does not immediately precede l. 306.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL061_165_7" id="target_note_LCL061_165_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
