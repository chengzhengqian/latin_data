the sweetest kind of love. But that’s how human life is:
nothing is given for good. The young lad’s father wants<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">195</span><span class="br"></span>
to give him a wife. When the girl’s mother found out
about this, she commanded that her daughter be brought
home. This is how it happened. Farewell and be victorious
through true valor, as you’ve been so far. Protect your

laws, lay low your enemies, and earn laud and laurels,
so that the conquered Carthaginians may suffer punishment

how Love tricks me—I am mentally exhausted—how he
puts me to flight, drives me off, lays hands on me, drags
me back, holds me back, entices me, bestows on me.
