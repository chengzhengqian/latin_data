here after her ten months<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL061_153_4" id="target_note_LCL061_153_4"><sup>4</sup></a> were up. Since she didn’t
know who the offender in this matter was, she took her<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">165</span><span class="br"></span>
father’s slave into her confidence and gave this girl to this
slave to expose her and leave her to die. He did expose
her. This woman picked the girl up. [That slave who’d
abandoned her observed secretly where and into which
house the woman was taking the girl.] As you’ve heard<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">170</span><span class="br"></span>
her admit herself, she gave this girl to the prostitute
Melaenis, who brought her up well and chastely as her
own daughter. That man from Lemnos, on the other
hand, later married his neighbor, his relative. She passed<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">175</span><span class="br"></span>
away and thus obliged her husband. After laying his wife
to rest, he moved here at once. He married the same
woman whom he’d once raped here when she was a virgin,
and he recognized that she was the one he’d raped.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">180</span><span class="br"></span>
She said to him that she gave birth to a daughter because
of his wrong deed and that she immediately gave her to a
slave to expose. Right away he had that same slave make a
search, to see if he could find out who picked her up.
Now the slave is incessantly giving his attention to this<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">185</span><span class="br"></span>
task, to see if he can find that prostitute whom he’d once
seen from his hiding place pick up the girl when he had
exposed her. Now I want to pay off the remainder of my
debt so that my name may be crossed off your books
and I won’t owe you anything. There’s a young man here<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">190</span><span class="br"></span>
in Sicyon, whose father is alive. He is crazy about that
abandoned girl who went off to her mother a moment
