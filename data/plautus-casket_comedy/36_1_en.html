all up with me, unhappy and wretched me! It’s nowhere,
and I’m nowhere too. The girl who got lost has made me
get lost. But still, I’ll continue as I began, I’ll search. Yes,
inside I’m afraid and outside I’m scared, seeing how fear
is driving me mad on both sides and seeing how terribly
wretched human beings are. That man who has it is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">690</span><span class="br"></span>
happy now, whoever he is, though it can’t be of any use to
him and it can be to me. But I’m delaying myself because
I’m doing this so slowly. Halisca, pay attention, look at
the ground and look down, examine the street with your
eyes, practice augury cleverly. (<span class="italic">stoops down</span>)</p></div>

I can see the mark of a shoe in the dust; I’ll follow this
way. In this place now he stopped with another person.
Here my eyes met with a fracas a moment ago. He didn’t<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">700</span><span class="br"></span>
continue on this way: he stood here, from here he went
there. Here there was a gathering. It concerns two, that’s
obvious. Aha! I can see a single footprint. But he went
away this way. I’ll examine it. From here he went here,
from here he never went away. (<span class="italic">pauses</span>) I’m doing something
that’s already done. What’s gone is gone: my back
along with the casket. I’m going back inside. (<span class="italic">goes toward
