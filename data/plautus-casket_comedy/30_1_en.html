<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phan</span><p class="lineGroup">You ought to have inquired who she’d given her to.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lam</span><p class="lineGroup">I did inquire and she said to the prostitute Melaenis.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">575</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mel</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) He’s let out my name, I’m completely ruined!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lam</span><p class="lineGroup">When she’d spoken, I questioned her at once; “Where
does she live?” I said. “Take me there and show me.”
“She’s gone away,” she said, “to live abroad.”</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mel</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">reviving, aside</span>) She’s sprinkling a little water onto me.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">580</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lam</span><p class="lineGroup">“We’ll follow her wherever she went. Are you trying to
fool me like this? You’re dead unless you tell me where
she lives now.” I didn’t stop insisting on this until the old
woman swore that she’d show her to me right away.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phan</span><p class="lineGroup">But you shouldn’t have let her go.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lam</span><p class="lineGroup">She’s being watched. But she said she was already going<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">585</span><span class="br"></span>
to meet a certain woman, a friend of hers, who was also
affected by this business. And I know she’ll come.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">mel</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) She’ll tell on me and †***† her wretchedness to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">590</span><span class="br"></span>
mine.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phan</span><p class="lineGroup">What do you want me to do now?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lam</span><p class="lineGroup">Go inside and take heart. If your husband comes, tell him
to wait at home, so that I don’t have to look for him if
I want him for anything. I’m rushing back to the old
woman.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phan</span><p class="lineGroup">Lampadio, please take care of it.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">595</span><span class="br"></span></p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lam</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ll sort this business out properly.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">phan</span><p class="lineGroup">I put my hope in the gods and you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lam</span><p class="lineGroup">I also put mine in them . . . that you’ll go home.</p></div>
