<span class="stage"><span class="italic">At this point the transmission of the Palatine manuscripts stops;
it resumes at l. 492. The Ambrosian palimpsest contains parts of
the passage missing in the Palatine tradition, but in many places
the remaining parts are more or less illegible. Some fragments
have come down to us through the indirect tradition. Fr. i and ii
probably stood among the roughly one hundred lines that were
lost between ll. 229 and 231.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL061_157_5" id="target_note_LCL061_157_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Fr. i still belongs to the preceding
scene. Fr. ii belongs to the following scene, in which Alcesimarchus
asks his slave to insult him because he did not stay with his
girlfriend. Fr. ii may have stood directly before l. 233.</span></span>
