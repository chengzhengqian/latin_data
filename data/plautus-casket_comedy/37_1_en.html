<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">hal</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">aside</span>) A good woman and a bad man want to speak to
me? Well, after all, the man who is calling me knows
better what he wants than I who am being called. I’m returning.
(<span class="italic">to Lampadio</span>) Did you see anyone looking for a
casket with a rattle here, in this area, please? Poor me, I
lost it here. I believe I dropped it a short while ago, when<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">710</span><span class="br"></span>
we were running toward Alcesimarchus to stop him committing
suicide.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lam</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Phanostrata</span>) This woman’s the one who lost the casket.
Let’s be quiet for a bit, my mistress.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">hal</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">still to Lampadio</span>) Dear me, I’m ruined! What should I
say to my mistress? She told me so strictly to watch over it
so that Selenium could recognize her parents more easily<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">715</span><span class="br"></span>
with it, the girl who was introduced into my mistress’s
family when she was little, whom a certain prostitute
gave her.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">lam</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">to Phanostrata</span>) She’s talking about our business, she
ought to know where your daughter is, judging from the
indications she’s giving.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">hal</span><p class="lineGroup">(<span class="italic">still to Lampadio</span>) Now she wants to take the initiative in
returning her to her mother and father, to whom she was
born. My good man, please, you aren’t paying attention,
I’m entrusting you with my affairs.</p></div>
