<p>Greeks and of the Romans. So far as we can judge from the fragments, the work contained much that was not worth writing, and, as one might expect, possessed little or no merit as poetry. It was dedicated apparently to one Baebius. For various views, cf. S. K. Sakellanopoulos, Γραμματολογικὰ, 1; G. Hermann, <span class="italic">Opusc,</span> 8, 390; J.

<p>Gellius: Accius, in the first book of <span class="italic">Records of the Stage,</span> uses very flimsy arguments by which it is proved (so he thinks) that Hesiod was born first (<span class="italic">sc. before Homer</span>). For, says he, when Homer at the beginning<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL314_579_c" id="target_note_LCL314_579_c"><sup>c</sup></a> of his poem had occasion to tell how Achilles was a son of Peleus, he did not go on to say who Peleus was. This information, says Accius, he would without any doubt have given us, if he had not seen that it had been given already by Hesiod.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL314_579_d" id="target_note_LCL314_579_d"><sup>d</sup></a> And again, he says, in describing the Cyclops, Homer would not have failed to make particular mention of so important a detail as the fact that the monster was one-eyed, if his predecessor Hesiod had not already made<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL314_579_e" id="target_note_LCL314_579_e"><sup>e</sup></a> it common knowledge, through his poems, just as much as the former example.</p>
