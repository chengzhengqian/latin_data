<p>93. Then Pope Johannes returned from Justinus; Theodoric received him in a hostile spirit, and ordered him to be deemed as one of his enemies; a few days later Johannes died. When the people were marching before his dead body, suddenly one of the crowd was possessed by a devil and fell down; but when they had come, with the coffin in which Johannes was carried, to the place where the stricken man lay, he suddenly got up sound and well and took his place in the front of the funeral procession. When the people and the senators beheld this, they began to take relics<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL331_567_1" id="target_note_LCL331_567_1"><sup>1</sup></a> from the Pope’s garments. Then the body was escorted out of the city attended by the great rejoicing of the people.</p>

These were called <span class="italic">annonae</span> (Dig. xxvi. 7, 32, 6), <span class="italic">indictiones temporariae</span> (Dig. xxxiii. 2, 28) or <span class="italic">indictiones</span> (Pliny, <span class="italic">Paneg.</span> 29). Their scope was extended in the fourth century and regulated by a census of 289. Diocletian made them annual, and after 297 held a new census, to be repeated every five years, and combined every three census-periods into a fifteen-year cycle, counting the years from one to fifteen and then beginning again. This arrangement was wrongly said to have begun in 312, for papyrus receipts show that the cycle began in 297—298, coinciding with Diocletian’s stay in Egypt, when he personally conducted the siege of Alexandria, which ended early in 297 (Eutr. ix. 23). The fifteen-year cycle probably had some connection with Egypt. Augustus, or at latest Tiberius, established a rating there every fourteen years, because the fourteenth year was the end of puberty and the beginning of liability to taxation. The system was extended from Egypt to other provinces before the middle of the fourth century. In Italy the cycle began on September 1st (Ambros. <span class="italic">Noē et arca</span> 17, 60, Migne, 14, 390, <span class="italic">a Septembri mense annus videatur incipere, sicut indictionum praesentium usus ostendit</span>).

Christ, urbis Romae,</span> I. 979; and it was the same for the greater part (if not the whole) of the empire. September 1st was chosen as nearest to the beginning of the month in Egypt (Aug. 29). The <span class="italic">indictiones</span> were used as a means of dating in 307, at first in Egypt. In other provinces first in 359. In Italy first about 380 (Seeck in Pauly-Wiss., ix.
