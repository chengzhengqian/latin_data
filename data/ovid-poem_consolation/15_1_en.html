long perils, the hearing of which kept thy mind anxious, fear anticipated thy mourning; not abruptly did sorrow burst into thy heart, but by steps that fear had already made gentle. Jupiter before gave the baleful sign of bloody fate, when he assailed three temples with fire-bearing hand; and on a night grave Juno’s shrine and that of fearless Minerva and the sacred palace of all-powerful Caesar were struck. Nay, stars also are said to have fled the sky, and Lucifer to have left his wonted path: Lucifer in all the world was seen of none, and the day came unheralded by any star: this gave warning that a star’s destruction threatened the earth, and that a noble light should be sunk in Stygian waters.</p>
<p>But thou who dost survive to console thy sorrowing mother, live, I pray, that she herself may see thy old age. Live long, and pass thy brother’s and thine own allotted years, and let thine aged mother live with her aged son. My prayer shall be fulfilled; heaven, while it would fain excuse the past, will make all else happy after Drusus. Yet thou canst dare to indulge so violent a grief that thou refusest
with unwise courage to take food. Scarce hadst thou been like to live for even a few hours, when Caesar brought thee succour against thy will; he urged thee with prayers, and mingled claims of right therein, and pouring water he moistened thy parched throat. Nor had thy son less care to save his parent: he made persuasive entreaty, and with good right. The merit of thy consort and of thy son hath reached to all: by the aid of thy consort and of thy son, O Livia, thou didst survive. Refrain at last thy tears: they will not call him back whom once the ferryman has borne in the ghost-laden skiff.
