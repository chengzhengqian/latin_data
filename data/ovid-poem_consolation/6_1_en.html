The rods that I see for the first time, I see when thou art dead; I see them reversed, significant of evil. Who would believe it? can this be the gladdest day that has dawned for thy mother, that whereon she sees her son in highest honour? Can I be no longer blest? can the half of the Neros now be taken from me, Drusus renowned for the name of his mother’s sire? Can he be mine no more, nor make me any more a parent? Am I no more the mother of Drusus? lives he now no more?
