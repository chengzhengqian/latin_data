she felt: lest anything escape her insatiate grasp, she rages, and everywhere makes injustice justice for herself. Forsooth, if Livia alone had been immune from grief, then Fortune’s realm had suffered! What if she had not so borne herself in all her ways that her blessings stirred no envy? Think too of Caesar’s house, which surely should have been exempt from death and higher than human ills. He, our guardian, set consecrated on the highest citadel, was worthy to regard the affairs of men from a place of safety, nor to be wept for by his own, nor weep for any of his kin, nor to endure himself what we, the common folk, endure; we have seen him mourning for his sister’s offspring snatched away: that grief, as in Drusus’ case, was shared by all; he buried Agrippa in thy sepulchre, Marcellus, and already that place held his two sons-in-law;
scarce was the tomb’s door fast closed upon Agrippa’s corpse, lo! his sister receives the rites of death.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_329_1" id="target_note_LCL232_329_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Lo! thrice has the tribute been paid,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_329_2" id="target_note_LCL232_329_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Drusus, the latest loss, is the fourth to draw tears from mighty Caesar. Shut now, ye Fates, shut the tomb too oft unlocked! more already than is right has that house of yours been opened. Drusus, thou goest; and fruitlessly is thy name called for the last time:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_329_3" id="target_note_LCL232_329_3"><sup>3</sup></a> let this be the last complaining for thy fate. Sorrow for thee can fill whole ages, and take rank as a mighty mourning: many men were lost in thee, nor wert thou, so great a multitude of virtues, the only one in whom all excellence was found,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_329_4" id="target_note_LCL232_329_4"><sup>4</sup></a>
