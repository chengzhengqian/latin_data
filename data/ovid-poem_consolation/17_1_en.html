with titles; as ‘consul’ dost thou read of me, as conqueror of Germany, a world unknown, who died, alas! in his country’s cause: my victorious temples are wreathed in Apollo’s laurel, and I have felt the obsequies of my own funeral, and the familiar solemn march of men, and the gifts of kings, and all the cities read upon their placards<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_357_1" id="target_note_LCL232_357_1"><sup>1</sup></a>; and with what dutifulness those youths carried me, who stood so nobly born before my pyre. Last, I have meed of praise from Caesar’s sacred lips, and drew tears from a god. And shall I need any’s pity? Refrain at last thy weeping. This I ask, who am thy weeping’s cause.” This does Drusus feel, if he feels aught in the shadows, nor believe thou less of so great a hero. Thou hast, and mayst thou ever have, I pray, a son who is a pattern to many; may the elder part of thy offspring be preserved to thee. Thou hast a spouse, the guardian of mankind, and while he lives, it becomes not thy house, O Livia, to mourn.</p>
