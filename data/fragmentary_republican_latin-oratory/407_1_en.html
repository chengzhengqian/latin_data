<p class="noindent">Then, lecturing on rhetoric, he [M’. Otacilius Pitholaus (restored name)] taught Pompey and outlined the deeds of that man’s father and also of [Pompey] himself in several books ...</p>

<p class="noindent">You ought to know by now what reply L. Caesar [L. Iulius Caesar, proquaestor in Africa in 47/46 BC] is taking back from Pompey, what letter he is carrying from the latter to Caesar [C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)]; for it was written and dispatched in such a way that it would be displayed in public. For that, in my own mind, I blamed Pompey, who, although he is a splendid writer, granted to our Sestius [P. Sestius (<span class="bold">135</span>)] to write up such great matters and of such a kind that will come into the hands of everyone. And so I have never read anything written “in a more Sestian style.”</p>

<p class="noindent">For there are many speeches composed by Greeks and Romans for others to deliver, to whose circumstances and way of life what was said had to be adapted. Did Cicero think in the same way or assume the same character when he wrote for Pompey and for T. Ampius [T. Ampius Balbus; cf. F 27] or others, and did he not consider the fortune, position, and achievements of each single one of them, and thus produce also an image of all those to whom he was lending his voice, so that they seemed to speak better, but still as themselves?</p>
