<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] Both men [Rutilius and Scaurus] were by nature forceful and sharp. Thus, when they had been candidates for the consulship at the same time [in 116 BC], not only did that one who had experienced a defeat accuse his rival, the consul designate, of bribery, but even Scaurus, on acquittal, took Rutilius to court.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 4</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">On the Orator</span></p>
<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Caesar Strabo</span>:] Also effective are those comments that, by conjecture, explain matters in a completely different way from what they are, but sharply and wittily; as, when Scaurus prosecuted Rutilius for bribery, when he himself had been elected consul and the other had experienced a defeat, and pointed out the letters A.F.P.R. in the other’s account books, and said that this meant “transacted on credit for Publius Rutilius,” whereas Rutilius [said] “first done, then registered,” C. Canius, a Roman knight, who supported Rufus, called out that none of these was expressed by those letters. “What then?” said Scaurus;—“Aemilius did it, punished is Rutilius.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_233_1" id="target_note_LCL540_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
