<p class="noindent">Many other things concerning particularly the end of Scipio’s life and his trial, death, funeral and tomb go in opposite directions, so that I do not know which tradition, which writings I should subscribe to. [2] There is no agreement as regards the accuser (some write that M. Naevius, some that the Petillii called him to court), neither about the time for which the appearance in court was set, nor about the year in which he died, nor where he died or was buried.... [5] And there is a discrepancy not only among historiographers, but also the speeches (provided that those that are in circulation are works of these men themselves) of P. Scipio and Ti. Gracchus [Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">10</span>), F 1A] are inconsistent with one another. [6] The title of the speech by P. Scipio contains the name of M. Naevius, Tribune of the People; the speech itself is without the name of the accuser; it calls him now a scoundrel, now a trifler.</p>

<p class="noindent">The author [Valerius] Antias [Roman historian of 1st cent. BC; <span class="italic">FRHist </span>25] is refuted [as regards his view on the date of Scipio’s death] by the Tribune of the People M. Naevius, against whom an oration by P. Africanus exists entitled after him.</p>
