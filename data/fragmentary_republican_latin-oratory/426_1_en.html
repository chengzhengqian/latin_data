<p class="noindent">You were, then, at the house of Laeca [M. Porcius Laeca] on that night [November 6–7, 63 BC], Catiline, you allocated the regions of Italy, you decided where you wanted each man to go, you chose those whom you were leaving at Rome and those whom you were taking with you, you assigned the parts of the city to be burned, you confirmed that you were on the point of departure yourself, you said that even now there was a little delay for you because I was alive.</p>

<p class="noindent">Finally, when his many efforts came to naught, with the help of M. Porcius Laeca he summoned the leaders of the conspiracy again in the dead of night, [4] and there, after having made many complaints about their lethargy, he informed them that he had sent Manlius [C. Manlius, follower of Catiline] on ahead [to Etruria] to the large throng that he had prepared for taking up arms, that likewise he had sent to other suitable places other men who were to start the fighting, and that he himself was eager to set out for the army if only he had first crushed Cicero; that man was a major obstacle to his plans.</p>
