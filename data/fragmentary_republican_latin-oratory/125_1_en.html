Gracchus (<span class="bold">48</span>), F 54–55]. There are also [speeches] of Tubero against Gracchus; he was mediocre in speaking, but very skilled in debating.” [118] Thereupon <span class="sc">Brutus</span> [said]: “Remarkable: I see the same thing applying to our countrymen as to the Greeks, that practically all Stoics are very able in precise exposition, and they do that with art and are almost architects of words; but when the same people are transferred from debating to speaking, they are found to be deficient. One exception I make for Cato [M. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">126</span>), T 1], in whom, though a most accomplished Stoic, I feel no desire for the most perfect eloquence, which I regard as slight in Fannius, even in Rutilius [P. Rutilius Rufus (<span class="bold">44</span>)] as not great, in Tubero as nonexistent.”</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] Your kinsman too, Brutus, M. Pennus, in his Tribunate, wittily harassed C. Gracchus [C. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">48</span>)], Pennus being a little more advanced in age. For in the consulship of M. Lepidus and L. Orestes [126 BC] Gracchus was quaestor, and Pennus, son of that Marcus who was consul with Q. Aelius [167 BC], was Tribune; but he, hoping for all the highest honors, died after his aedileship.</p>
