this kind at a meeting of the People, Memmius induced the People to send L. Cassius [L. Cassius Longinus, pr. 111, cos. 107 BC], who was praetor at the time, to Jugurtha and to have him bring the king to Rome under pledge of public protection, so that through the king’s testimony the offenses of Scaurus [M. Aemilius Scaurus (<span class="bold">43</span>)] and the rest whom he was accusing of having accepted money might the more readily be disclosed.</p>

<p class="noindent">But when C. Memmius had called a public meeting, while the commons were hostile to the king (some demanding that he be imprisoned, others that he be punished by death as a public enemy after the custom of the ancestors, if he did not reveal the accomplices in his crime), he, taking thought for worthy behavior rather than anger, quieted their outbursts of feelings and soothed their spirits; finally he confirmed that the pledge of public protection would be inviolate as far as he was concerned. [4] Afterward, as soon as silence had set in and after Jugurtha had been brought before the meeting, he [Memmius] gave a speech, recalled his [the king’s] actions at Rome and in Numidia, and pointed out his crimes against his father and his brothers. He said that, although the Roman People knew by whose aid and by whose complicity he had done these things, they nevertheless wanted to have clearer signs from him; that, if he revealed the truth, he could place much hope in the good faith and mercy of the Roman People; but if he kept silence, he would not save his accomplices, but would ruin himself and his hopes.</p>
