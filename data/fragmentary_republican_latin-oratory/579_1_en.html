<p class="noindent">By this he [Cicero] means that on that day on which Clodius [P. Clodius Pulcher (<span class="bold">137</span>)] was killed a Tribune of the People in his pay delivered a speech before the People. And on that day, as is clear from the records, Sallust [C. Sallustius Crispus (<span class="bold">152</span>), F 1] and Q. Pompeius delivered speeches at a public meeting, both enemies of Milo [T. Annius Milo (<span class="bold">138</span>)] and rather restless. But to me he seems to mean Q. Pompeius; for his speech to the People was more seditious.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 2</span> Asconius on Cicero, <span class="italic">Pro Milone</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Q. Pompeius Rufus, a Tribune of the People, who had been on the friendliest terms of all with P. Clodius [P. Clodius Pulcher (<span class="bold">137</span>)] and declared openly that he was an adherent of that gang, had said at a public meeting a few days after Clodius had been killed: “Milo [T. Annius Milo (<span class="bold">138</span>)] has given you someone to cremate in the Senate house; he will give you someone to bury on the Capitol.” In the same speech to the People the same man had said—for he delivered it on the eighth day before the Kalends of February [January 23, 52 BC]—that, when on the preceding day, that is the ninth day before the Kalends of February [January 22], Milo had wished to come to Pompeius in his gardens, Pompeius had sent him a message through a relative that he should not come to him.</p>
