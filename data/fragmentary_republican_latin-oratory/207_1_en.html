away of Caepio [Q. Servilius Caepio (<span class="bold">62</span>)], into a lament for the destruction of the army. In this way, by my speech I both excited afresh the pain of those who were mourning their own folk and renewed and rekindled the feelings of the Roman knights, by whom as judges the case was then handled, into hatred of Q. Caepio, from whom they had been estranged over [the composition of] the criminal courts [see <span class="bold">62</span>]. [200] As soon as I felt I had set up a firm hold on the court and on my line of defense, when I had won for me the goodwill of the People, whose claims I had upheld even when involved with civil discord, and had also turned the minds of the judges entirely in favor of our cause, by reason either of the calamity of the community, or of yearning grief for relatives, or of private hatred of Caepio, then I began to blend with this impetuous and violent type of oratory that other type, of which I spoke earlier [Cic.<span class="italic"> De or.</span> 2.183â€“84], characterized by mildness and gentleness: I said that I was fighting for my comrade, who, for me, should have the place of children according to ancestral tradition, and for all my own fair reputation and general welfare as it were; nothing more disgraceful could happen to my reputation, nothing bitterer for my distress, than if I, who was thought to have often saved complete strangers to myself, though nonetheless my fellow citizens, had been unable to aid my own comrade. [201] I begged the judges, if they saw me affected by justifiable, loyal distress, to excuse this in consideration of my years, my official career, my achievements, particularly if, in other trials, they had realized that I always made my petitions on behalf of friends in danger, never for myself.</p>
