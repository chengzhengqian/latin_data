Ligarius was in Africa; and C. Pansa, a man of outstanding ability, fortified possibly by that intimacy that he has with you, was bold enough to admit this. So, where I should turn I do not know. For, since you could not have known this at first hand nor heard of it from somewhere, I had come prepared to take advantage of your lack of knowledge to save an unfortunate man. But now that what was hidden has been revealed by the diligence of an opponent, one has to admit it, I suppose, especially as my friend Pansa has brought about that it is no longer a debatable question ...</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">When consul in 43 BC, Pansa gave a number of speeches (F 3–6) in the Senate and at public meetings (Cic. </span>Phil.<span class="italic"> 12.2, 12.15; </span>Fam.<span class="italic"> 12.7.1; </span>CCMR<span class="italic">, App. A: 365), in the context of the conflict with M. Antonius (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">159</span></span><span class="italic">).</span></p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">In the Senate on January 1, 43 BC (F 3)</span></span>

<p class="noindent">Nothing has ever seemed to me longer in the coming than these Kalends of January [January 1, 43 BC], Members of the Senate ... But all complaint [about delay] of days past has been set aside by the speech of the consuls [cf. <span class="bold">161</span> F4], who have spoken in such a manner as to make the Kalends seem eagerly awaited rather than too long delayed. And as the speech of the consuls raised my spirits and gave me hope not only of preserving safety but also of recovering former dignity, so the proposal of the gentleman first called [Q. Fufius Calenus, cos. 47 BC] would have perturbed me, if I did not have confidence in your courage and resolution.</p>
