<p class="noindent">Glaucia, an abominable man, but shrewd nevertheless, used to warn the People, when some law was being read out, to pay attention to the opening phrase. If it was “dictator, consul, praetor, master of the horse,” they should not worry; for they would know that it did not affect them; but if it was “whosoever after the passing of this law,” then they were to see to it that they were not made liable to any new form of inquiry.</p>
