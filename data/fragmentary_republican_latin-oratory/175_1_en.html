<p class="noindent">But that “honor” was also a neutral word and was used as such, so that people even spoke of “bad honor,” thereby signifying “injury,” is indeed very rare. [4] Quintus Metellus Numidicus, however, in the speech that he delivered on his triumph, used these words: “In this affair, by as much as the whole of you are more important than I alone, by so much he [probably C. Marius; cf. Sall. <span class="italic">Iug.</span> 73.2–7, 84.1] inflicts upon you greater insult and injury than on me, Romans; and by as much as honest men are more willing to suffer wrong than to do it to another, by so much has he shown ‘worse honor’ to you than to me; for he wishes me to suffer injustice and you to inflict it, Romans, so that on the one side there will be complaint and on the other reproach.” [5] He says, “he has shown ‘worse honor’ {favor} to you than to me,” and the meaning of this expression is as he himself too says earlier: “he has afflicted you with a greater injury and insult than me.” [6] Besides the meaning of this word, I thought I ought to quote this statement from the speech of Quintus Metellus, so as to mark out a precept of Socrates [cf. Plat. <span class="italic">Gorg.</span> 473a5, 489a3–4, 508b8–9]: “that it is worse to be unjust than to suffer injustice.”</p>
