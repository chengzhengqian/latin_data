Marcus Crassus [M. Licinius Crassus Dives (<span class="bold">102</span>)], an ex-consul, likewise with Publius Sulla [P. Cornelius Sulla] and L. Autronius [i.e., P. Autronius Paetus], who, after their election to the consulship [for 65 BC], had been found guilty of bribery; their plan was to attack the Senate at the beginning of the year and, having killed those whom they had resolved to kill, Crassus was to usurp the dictatorship, he himself was to be named by him as master of the horse, and, when they had organized the Republic according to their pleasure, the consulship was to be restored to Sulla and Autronius. [2] This plot is mentioned by Tanusius Geminus in his history [<span class="italic">FRHist</span> 44 F2], by Marcus Bibulus in edicts [M. Calpurnius Bibulus (<span class="bold">122</span>), F 2–6], and by C. Curio the father in speeches. Cicero too seems to hint at it in some letter to Axius [not preserved], where he says that Caesar in his consulship established the kingly rule that he had had in mind as aedile. Tanusius adds that Crassus, out of conscience or fear, did not appear on the day appointed for the massacre and therefore Caesar then did not give the signal that, as had been agreed, was to be given by him; and Curio says that it was agreed that he should let his toga fall from his shoulder. [3] The same Curio, but also M. Actorius Naso [<span class="italic">FRHist</span> 43 F1] are witnesses that he [Caesar] also made a plot with the young Gnaeus Piso [Cn. Calpurnius Piso, quaestor pro praetore in Hispania citerior in 65/64 BC], to whom, because he was suspected of political intrigues in the city [of Rome], the province of Hispania had been assigned unasked and out of the regular order; and that it was agreed to rise in revolt at the same time, the latter abroad and he himself at Rome, aided by the Ambrani [?] and the Transpadani;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL541_137_1" id="target_note_LCL541_137_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that the designs of both of them were rendered void by Piso’s death.</p>
