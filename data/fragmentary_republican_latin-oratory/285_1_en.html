his delivery was rapid and impetuous, which was a matter of his nature, while his diction was agitated and a little too exuberant, which was a matter of his age. I did not object to it; for I am well content that fecundity should come to the fore in a young man.... [89] I instantly perceived his natural qualities and did not miss the opportunity; I urged him to regard the Forum as his school of instruction and to choose what master he pleased, though if he listened to me, L.
