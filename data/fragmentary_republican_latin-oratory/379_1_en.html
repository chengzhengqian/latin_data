<p class="noindent">But Crassus was more continuously ready with his services, and not aloof nor difficult to access, instead always moving in the thick of things, and so through his universal kindness prevailed over the other’s [Cn. Pompeius Magnus (<span class="bold">111</span>)] solemn bearing. But they say that dignity of person, persuasiveness of speech, and pleasantness of features were equally present in both [Crassus and Pompey].</p>

Licinius Murena, cos. 62 BC] would not have someone to defend him in that community in which our ancestors did not wish anyone, even the humblest man, ever to be without an advocate.</p>
