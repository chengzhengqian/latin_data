 of the same type I regard as not at all as worthy of the ears of a cultivated audience, but as very well suited to turbulent meetings of the People. Of this type, to disturb the chronological order with respect to these, was recently L. Quinctius; Palicanus [M. Lollius Palicanus (<span class="bold">117</span>)], too, was better suited to the ears of the ignorant.</p>

<p class="noindent">Once you had gotten to know the fellow’s insolence, you had gotten to know his pride and his airs as a Tribune. By the gods, what odious behavior there was! What haughtiness, what lack of knowledge of himself, what troublesome and unendurable arrogance! ... [110] For as to Quinctius, what case had he ever undertaken before, although he had lived to an age of almost fifty years? Who had ever seen him not just in the role of a pleader, but in that of a more respected legal adviser? Because he had seized upon the Rostra, long unoccupied, and upon that place abandoned by a Tribune’s voice since the arrival of L. Sulla [L. Cornelius Sulla], and had recalled the populace, now unused to public meetings, to a semblance of its former practice, for that reason he was rather popular with a certain class of people for a short while. And the same person, how much hatred he later experienced from those very men through whom he had climbed to a higher place! Nor was this an injustice. [111] For make an effort to recall not only his manners and arrogance, but also his expression and clothing, and even that purple robe running down to his heels.</p>
