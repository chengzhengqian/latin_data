<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Q. Hortensius Hortalus (114–50 BC; cos. 69 BC; </span>RE<span class="italic"> Hortensius 13) was regarded as the greatest orator before Cicero and as his only rival (T 1, 9–10). According to ancient authorities, mainly Cicero, Hortensius was a promising orator from an early age (T 1–2). He trained assiduously, but he relaxed this regime after his consulship; the lack ofexercise and the fact that the Asiatic style of speaking was seen as more appropriate for young men meant that the elder Hortensius was less highly regarded (T 2, 4–5). Hortensius’ style is described as full and elaborate, in line with the Asiatic genre, and characterized by an immaculate structure, comprehensiveness, and energetic delivery (T2–3); elsewhere, he is seen as the representative of a single type of style, the middle style (Cic. </span>Orat.<span class="italic"> 106). He had an excellent memory (T 2; Cic. </span>De or.<span class="italic"> 3.230; Sen. </span>Contr.<span class="italic"> 1, </span>praef.<span class="italic"> 19).</span></p>
