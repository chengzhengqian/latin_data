that those who eat the upper parts of such birds and fatted fowl have &lt;no&gt; taste. If luxury continues to increase in this proportion, what remains but that men should ask for part of their feasts to be removed, so that they may not fatigue themselves by feeding, when the couch is more profusely adorned with gold, silver, and purple for some mortals than for the immortal gods?”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic"> (</span>LPPR<span class="italic">, p.324), put forward by the Tribune of the People C. Mamilius Limetanus in 109 BC (Sall. </span>Iug.<span class="italic"> 40), Galba was accused of having accepted money from King Jugurtha; despite the speech in his own defense, he was found guilty and went into exile (</span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 52).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 1</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Brutus</span></p>
<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] Upon this period followed C. Galba, son of Servius [Ser. Sulpicius Galba (<span class="bold">19</span>)], that very eloquent man, and son-in-law of P. Crassus [P. Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus (<span class="bold">31</span>)], also eloquent and an expert in law. Our fathers praised him [Galba]; they liked him too for the memory of his father, but he fell on the path. For he was convicted as a result of the proposal of Mamilius, through odium aroused in relation to a conspiracy with Jugurtha, though he had spoken in his own defense. His peroration, which is called epilogue, is extant; it was held in such honor when we were boys that we even learned it by heart. He was the first man since the foundation of Rome, though belonging to a priestly college, to be found guilty by a public court of law.</p>
