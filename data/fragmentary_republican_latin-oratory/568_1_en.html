about him, he was taken to court by P. Valerius Triarius, a young man ready to speak and of known industry—the sonof the man [C. Valerius Triarius; <span class="italic">RE</span> Valerius 363] who had taken up arms against M. Lepidus [M. Aemilius Lepidus (<span class="bold">95</span>)] in Sardinia and later in Asia and Pontus had been legate of L. Lucullus [L. Licinius Lucullus (<span class="bold">90</span>)], when the latter waged war against Mithridates—before M. Cato, the praetor in charge of the extortion court [M. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">126</span>), praet. 54 BC], as is written in the records, on the day before the Nones of Quintilis [July 6], on the third day after C. Cato [C. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">136</span>)] had been acquitted.</p>

Aemilius Scaurus, too, prosecuted for extortion, brought a hopeless and lamentable defense into court, so much so that, when the prosecutor said that under the law he was permitted to call one hundred and twenty witnesses and that he would not object to his acquittal if he [Scaurus] had named that number of persons from whom he had taken nothing in the province, he [Scaurus] was unable to take advantage of so fair an offer. All the same, because of his age-old nobility and the recent memory of his father [M. Aemilius Scaurus (<span class="bold">43</span>)], he was acquitted.</p>
