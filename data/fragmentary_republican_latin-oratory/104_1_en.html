<p class="noindent">L. Opimius, accused before the People by Q. Decius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_209_1" id="target_note_LCL540_209_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a Tribune of the People, on the grounds that he had thrown uncondemned citizens into jail, was acquitted.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 3</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">On the Orator</span></p>
<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Antonius</span>:] ...next, what will come before the court, which those men [teachers] order to investigate as follows: Opimius killed Gracchus. What is the issue of the case? That he did so in the interest of the country, after he had issued a call to arms on the basis of a Senate decree. Remove this [proposition], and there will be no case. Decius, however, denies that this very matter was allowed, as being against the laws. So this will come before the court: was it allowed on the basis of a Senate decree for the sake of saving the Republic?</p>
