When Pompey was offered the command in the fight against the pirates in 67 BC, Cassius Dio puts a long deceptive speech into his mouth, so that accepting it would appear to be thrust upon him (Cass. Dio 36.25–36; </span>CCMR<span class="italic">, App. A: 246). Pompey may not have delivered public speeches as frequently as other Republican politicians because of his focus on military exploits. According to Plutarch, Pompey had prepared a speech in Greek for addressing Ptolemy XIII in 48 BC, but was murdered before he was able to deliver it (Plut. </span>Pomp.<span class="italic">79.2–4).</span></p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] And my contemporary Pompey, a man born to all the most outstanding achievements, would have enjoyed greater glory for eloquence had not ambition for still greater glory drawn him off to military fame. In his language he was sufficiently elevated, he saw matters sagaciously; his delivery, indeed, possessed much splendor in his voice and great dignity in his movement.</p>

<p class="noindent">How great his [Pompey’s] powers are in counsel, how great in the weight and command of eloquence, which itself contains a certain dignity belonging to a commander, you have often observed, Romans, from this very place [the Rostra in the Forum].</p>
