<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Laelius</span>:] With what flattering words C. Papirius [C. Papirius Carbo (<span class="bold">35</span>), F7] not long ago tried to penetrate the ears of a meeting of the People, when he attempted to carry a law about making the Tribunes of the People eligible for reelection! We spoke against it, but nothing about myself; I will talk about Scipio [P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus minor (<span class="bold">21</span>), F28–29] more happily. What great weight, by the immortal gods, what great majesty there was in his speech, so that one would easily say that he was the leader of the Roman People, not one of their group! But you [the interlocutors, C. Fannius (<span class="bold">32</span>) and Q. Mucius Scaevola (<span class="bold">50</span>)] both were present, and the speech is in everyone’s hands. As a result, this “People’s law” was rejected by the People’s votes.</p>
