<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] To about the same time, a little younger than Iulius [C. Iulius Caesar Strabo (<span class="bold">73</span>)], but almost contemporary, belong C. Cotta [C. Aurelius Cotta (<span class="bold">80</span>)], P. Sulpicius, Q. Varius [Q. Varius Hybrida (<span class="bold">88</span>)], Cn. Pomponius [Cn. Pomponius (<span class="bold">72B</span>)], C. Curio [C. Scribonius Curio (<span class="bold">86</span>)], L. Fufius [L. Fufius (<span class="bold">75</span>)], M. Drusus [M. Livius Drusus (<span class="bold">72</span>)], P. Antistius [P. Antistius (<span class="bold">78</span>)]; in no period was the brood of orators more copious. [183] Of these Cotta and Sulpicius easily achieved the first place, both in my judgment and also in that of everyone.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] “Sulpicius, in fact, was of all whom I at least have heard the most elevated in style, and, so to speak, the most theatrical orator. His voice was strong and at the same time of pleasing and brilliant timbre; his gesture and bodily movement was graceful, in such a way, though, that it seemed made for the Forum, not for the stage; his language was swift and of easy flow and still not redundant or overflowing. He wished to imitate Crassus [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>)]; Cotta [C. Aurelius Cotta (<span class="bold">80</span>), T 2] preferred Antonius [M. Antonius (<span class="bold">65</span>)]. But the latter lacked the force of Antonius, the former the charm of Crassus.” [204] ... “Yes, and in these orators this is to be noticed, that those may be supreme who are unlike each other. For nothing was so unlike as Cotta to Sulpicius, and each of them surpassed their contemporaries by far.”</p>
