<p class="noindent">This other passage also from the same speech of Q. Metellus we regard as deserving of constant reading, no less, by Hercules, than what has been written by the most serious philosophers. [8] The words of Metellus are these: “The immortal gods have the greatest power, but they are not expected to be more indulgent to us than parents. Yet parents, if their children persist in wrongdoing, disinherit them from their fortune. What then are we to expect differently from the immortal gods, unless we put an end to our evil ways? It is fair that the gods are favorable only toward those who are not enemies to themselves. The immortal gods ought to approve, not supply, virtue.”</p>
