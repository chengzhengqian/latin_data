<p class="noindent">The commanders [Scipio and Mummius] had different characters, different interests. Indeed, Scipio was such a cultivated patron and admirer of liberal studies and every form of learning that he kept constantly with him, at home and in the field, Polybius and Panaetius, men outstanding by their intellect. For nobody punctuated the intervals between the duties of active life with leisure in a more refined way than this Scipio, and he always served the arts of either war or peace: always engaged in the pursuit of arms and studies, he was either training his body by dangers or his mind by studies.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Marcus Aurelius</span> to Fronto:] Yet throughout these days I have made excerpts for myself from sixty books in five volumes; but when you read “sixty,” there are included both brief Atellanae by Novius and little orations by Scipio, so that you should not become too frightened at the number.</p>
