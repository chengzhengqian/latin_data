<p class="noindent">More often, however, it is the prosecutor’s business to turn the judge away from an appeal to pity that the defendant may be about to make, and incite him to give a strong verdict. This point includes also anticipating what you think the opponent will say or do. For it both strengthens the judges’ scruples about observing their oath and takes away the attractiveness of those who are going to reply, because points &lt;that&gt; have been anticipated by the prosecutor are then not new if they are repeated on behalf of the defendant: thus [Messalla speaking] against Aufidia warns Servius Sulpicius [Ser. Sulpicius Rufus (<span class="bold">118</span>), F7– 10] not to use against him the argument of the jeopardy of the witnesses and of [Aufidia] herself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL542_437_1" id="target_note_LCL542_437_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
