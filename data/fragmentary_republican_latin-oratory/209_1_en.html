<p class="noindent">M. Marius Gratidianus, a kinsman of ours, had sold back to C. Sergius Orata the house that he himself had bought from that same person a few years earlier. It was subject to an easement {to Sergius}, but Marius had not mentioned this in the sale. The matter was carried to the courts; Crassus [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>), F 42] defended Orata, Antonius Gratidianus. Crassus pleaded the letter of the law: that with regard to a defect the vendor had knowingly not declared there was bound to be responsibility for making good. Antonius laid stress upon equity: since this defect had not been unknown to Sergius, as he had sold that same house, it had in no way been necessary to mention it, and that man had not been deceived, who was aware of the legal status of what he had bought.</p>
