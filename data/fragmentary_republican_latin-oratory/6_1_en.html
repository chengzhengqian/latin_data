<p class="noindent">Equal to Furius [M. Furius Camillus] in moderation was Marcius Rutilus Censorinus: for, when elected censor for the second time, he summoned the People to a public meeting and rebuked them in as stern a speech as he possibly could since they had conferred upon him twice that power whose duration their ancestors had thought proper to be curtailed because it seemed too great. Each was in the right, both Censorinus and the People: for the former advised them to entrust offices moderately, the latter entrusted itself to a man of moderation.</p>
