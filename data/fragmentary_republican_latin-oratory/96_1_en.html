<p class="noindent">...for Tiberius, fighting for a good and just measure [his agrarian bill] with an eloquence able to adorn even worse causes, was formidable and invincible, whenever, with the People crowding around the Rostra, he rose and pleaded for the poor: [5] that the wild beasts roaming over Italy have even a den, and that there is a place to sleep and to hide for every one of them; but that the men who fight and die for Italy have a share of air and light, but nothing else; instead, houseless and homeless, they wander about with their children and wives. And the generals lie, when they exhort the soldiers in their battles to ward off the enemy from sepulchers and shrines; [6] for none of all these many Romans has a hereditary altar, none an ancestral tomb, but they fight and die for the wealth and luxury of others, and though they are said to be masters of the world, they have not a single clod of earth as their own.</p>
