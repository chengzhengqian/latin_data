<p class="noindent">There was some slight lifting of his [Cn. Pompeius Magnus (<span class="bold">111</span>)] hair and suppleness of a well-proportioned shape around the eyes that produced a resemblance of his face, more talked about than actually apparent, to the portrait statues of king Alexander. Therefore, since many also applied the name to him in his earlier years, Pompey did not decline it, so that some now called him Alexander in derision. Hence, too, Lucius Philippus, a man of consular rank, when pleading on his behalf, said that he was doing nothing strange if, being Philip, he was a friend of Alexander.</p>
