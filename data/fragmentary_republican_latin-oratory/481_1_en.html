<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">more than one speech against Catiline; not all of them, however, need to be connected with this trial (</span>TLRR <span class="italic">217).</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But Catiline endured the peril of this charge, which Cicero brings up against him, a few months later. For after the election assembly for the consulship had taken place and after Catiline’s defeat [in 64 BC], L. Lucceius, a trained and educated man, who later stood as a candidate for the consulship too [in 60 BC], prosecuted him in the court for murder cases.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 4</span> Asconius on Cicero, <span class="italic">In Toga Candida</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Catiline is said to have committed adultery with that woman who later was his mother-in-law and to have married the woman who was born from this illicit relationship although she was his daughter. Lucceius too reproached Catiline with this in the speeches that he wrote against him. I have not yet found out the names of these women.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL541_459_1" id="target_note_LCL541_459_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
