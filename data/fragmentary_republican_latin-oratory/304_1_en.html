<p class="noindent">I can say that a man distinguished for his outstanding wisdom, C. Cotta, himself brought the matter of the annulment of his laws before the Senate.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">b</span> Asconius on Cicero, <span class="italic">Pro Cornelio</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This is the Cotta about whom we have already spoken frequently; he was regarded as a great orator and comparable in reputation for that with P. Sulpicius [P. Sulpicius Rufus (<span class="bold">76</span>)] and C. Caesar [C. Iulius Caesar Strabo (<span class="bold">73</span>)] &lt;...&gt; And those laws that he, although he had proposed them, put forward for annulment in the Senate seem to have concerned minor matters. For neither in Sallust nor in Livy nor in Fenestella is there mention of any second law proposed by him except for that one that he proposed during his consulship, against the wishes of the nobility and with much support of the People, that it should be allowed for those who had been Tribunes of the People to take up other magistracies too; this was forbidden by a law carried by the dictator L. Sulla a few years previously: he [Cicero] does not indicate that this law of Cotta’s was annulled.</p>
