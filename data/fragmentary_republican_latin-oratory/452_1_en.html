Caelius Rufus (<span class="bold">162</span>)] and Brutus [M. Iunius Brutus (<span class="bold">158</span>)] are rightly classed above both their predecessors and their successors. [4] And it does not matter that they differ among themselves in the species while they agree in genus. Calvus is more concise, Asinius more vigorous, Caesar brighter, Caelius more pungent, Brutus more dignified, Cicero more impassioned, fuller, and more forceful: yet they all exhibit the same healthiness of style, so that, if you took up the volumes of all of them at the same time, you would find that, in spite of their diverse talents, there is a certain family likeness in opinion and inclination.</p>

<p class="noindent">Here he [an admirer of brevity in oratory] produces his authorities to me and shows me from the Greeks the orations of Lysias and from our countrymen those of the brothers Gracchi [Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">34</span>) and C. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">48</span>)] and Cato [M. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">8</span>)], of whom most are indeed short and concise: I, for my part, counter Lysias with Demosthenes, Aeschines, Hyperides, and many others besides, and the Gracchi and Cato with Pollio [C. Asinius Pollio (<span class="bold">174</span>)], Caesar, Caelius [M. Caelius Rufus (<span class="bold">162</span>)], and above all M. Tullius [Cicero], whose best speech is generally thought to be the one that is longest.</p>
