<p class="noindent">...and at the same time I have noticed your ready and eager spirit in the defense of the Republic.... So keep the books on augury until both of us have time to spare. For when I demanded from you the fulfillment of your pledge in a letter, I imagined you near the city [of Rome] with lots of time to spare. But now I will expect, as you yourself promise, the edition of your complete speeches instead of the books on augury.</p>

<p class="noindent">I have a real regard for Appius, as I have often told you, and I perceived that I began to be respected by him as soon as we buried our hatchet. For as consul [54 BC] he was conferring honors upon me, a pleasant friend, and even keen on my literary pursuits. In fact, that friendliness toward him on my side was not wanting you can testify ... What reason is there that it should not be desirable for me to embrace a man flourishing in the prime of life, wealth, offices, ability, children, connections of blood and marriage, friends, in particular a colleague of mine [as augur] and [showing himself] devoted to me precisely by the learned praise of our college? ... The character of my ordinances and principles has some dissimilarity to his administration of the province [Cilicia]. Hence perhaps some have suspected that I differ from him out of personal animus, not from theoretical disagreement. But I have never said or done anything out of a desire to injure his reputation; and after this recent trouble and our friend Dolabella’s precipitate behavior [P. Cornelius Dolabella (<span class="bold">173</span>), prosecuting Pulcher <span class="italic">de maiestate</span>], I am ready with my intercession on his behalf in the hour of danger.</p>
