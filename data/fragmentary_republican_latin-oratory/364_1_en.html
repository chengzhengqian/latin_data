<p><span class="italic">During his consulship (78 BC), Lepidus disagreed with his colleague Q. Lutatius Catulus (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">96</span></span><span class="italic">) (Cic. </span>Cat.<span class="italic"> 3.24). He delivered speeches to the People, in which, among other things, he argued for a repeal of some of Sulla’s laws, but rejected a restitution of tribunician powers (F 1–2; </span>CCMR<span class="italic">, App. A: 233). The only “example” of a consular </span>contio<span class="italic"> is aspeech put in M. Aemilius Lepidus’ mouth by Sallust (F2A). Toward the end of his consulship, Lepidus joined those dissatisfied with Sulla’s land distributions in Etruria; in 77 BC he marched on Rome and was defeated by Q. Lutatius Catulus.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But as soon as the Tribunes of the People had agreed that the consuls should reinstate tribunician powers, first Lepidus rejected it, and at a public meeting a large proportion agreed with him when he said that it was not useful to reinstate tribunician powers. And his speech is extant. And he defended the grain law with nobody in opposition, so that grain for subsistence to the amount of five pecks would be given to the People, and he promised many other things: to recall exiles, to abolish arrangements introduced by Sulla, to reinstate those in whose lands he [L. Cornelius Sulla] had settled soldiers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL541_225_1" id="target_note_LCL541_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
