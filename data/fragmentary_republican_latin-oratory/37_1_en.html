proposed that all should be forced to take wives in order to produce children. [9] His speech is extant; Augustus Caesar read it out in the Senate as though written for that time, when he was leading discussions about marriage within classes.</p>

<p class="noindent">He [Augustus] even both read out entire volumes to the Senate and frequently made them known to the People by an edict, like the speeches of Q. Metellus on increasing [the number of] offspring and of Rutilius on the size of buildings [P. Rutilius Rufus (<span class="bold">44</span>), F 2], so as to convince them all the more that neither matter was picked up by him as the first person to do so, but that they had already at that time been a concern for the men of the past.</p>

<p class="noindent">While many learned men were listening, there was a reading of a speech by Metellus Numidicus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_75_1a" id="target_note_LCL540_75_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> an earnest and eloquent man, a speech that he delivered to the People during his censorship, on taking wives, whereby he urged them to enter marriages. [2] In that speech the following was written: “If we could [produce offspring] without a wife, Romans, all of us would avoid that annoyance; but since nature has ordained it in such a way that one can neither live sufficiently comfortably with them nor in any way without them, we must take thought for our lasting preservation rather than for short-lived pleasure.”</p>
