<p class="noindent">But I pardon Atratinus, a very cultured and excellent young man, a friend of mine; he can plead as an excuse either filial affection or necessity or his age. If he was willing to bring the accusation, I put it down to affection; if he was under orders, to necessity; if he had any hopes, to his youth.... [7] I was surprised and annoyed that this part of the accusation [criticism of Caelius’ life] was entrusted to Atratinus of all people. For it was not appropriate, nor did his age call for it, nor, as you could observe, did this excellent young man’s sense of propriety allow him to be busy with such a speech.</p>

<p class="noindent">But the blame for the part you [Atratinus] have played rests with those who desired you to play it [cf. F 3]; the credit belongs to your scruples, because we saw that you said this against your will, and to your ability, because you spoke with grace and refinement.</p>

<p class="noindent">For you [the prosecutors] have alleged, although indeed with hesitation and hints, that he was a partner in the conspiracy on account of his friendship with Catiline [L. Sergius Catilina (<span class="bold">112</span>)]; as regards this point there was not only no crime attached, but the speech of the eloquent young man [Atratinus] hardly hung together.</p>
