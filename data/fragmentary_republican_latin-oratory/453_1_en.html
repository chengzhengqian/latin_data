<p class="noindent">In eloquence and in the art of war he [Caesar] either equaled or surpassed the fame of the most eminent men. After the prosecution of Dolabella [F 15–23] he was without question numbered among the leading advocates. At all events, when Cicero reviews the orators in the work dedicated to Brutus [M. Iunius Brutus (<span class="bold">158</span>)], he states that he does not see to whom Caesar ought to yield [T 2], and he says that he has an elegant, also bright, and even grand and in some sense noble way of speaking. And to Cornelius Nepos he [Cicero] writes about him again as follows [letter fragment]: [2] “Come now, what orator would you rank above him of those who have done nothing else? Who has cleverer or more frequent pointed statements? Who is more elaborate or more elegant in diction?” At least while still a young man, he [Caesar] appears to have imitated the manner of speaking of Caesar Strabo, from whose speech that is entitled “On behalf of the Sardinians” [C. Iulius Caesar Strabo (<span class="bold">73</span>), F 7–10] he even transferred some passages word for word to a speech of his own in which he presented himself as an advocate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL541_403_1" id="target_note_LCL541_403_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He is said to have declaimed in a high-pitched voice with impassioned movement and gestures, not without grace. [3] He left several speeches, including some that are referred to as his on insufficient evidence [cf. F 48].</p>

Since this procedure is different from the prosecution of Dolabella (F 15–23), this must therefore be a reference to another speech by Caesar, also dating to his youth.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL541_403_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
