<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 6</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Pro Cornelio</span> (quoted by Asconius)</p>
<p class="noindent">“Cornelius,” he says, “gave the law about the voting rights of freedmen to C. Manilius [tr. pl. 66 BC].”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL542_137_1" id="target_note_LCL542_137_1"><sup>1</sup></a> What does this “gave” mean? He brought it with him? Or he asked for approval? Or he urged the passage? That he brought it with him [as a draft] is ridiculous, as if it were some law either difficult to compose or obscure to think out: for the last few years this law had not only been written down, but also been passed.</p>

Cluentius [Habitus]; he spoke both painstakingly and with tolerable eloquence; and he was trained, moreover, in the rules of Hermagoras, which, though they do not supply sufficiently the richest embellishments of oratory, yet, like spears fitted with throwing straps for the light-armed, thus furnish some outlines of argument ready for use and available for every single type of case [cf. <span class="bold">141</span> T 1].</p>
