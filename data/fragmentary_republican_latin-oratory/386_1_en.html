<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] Q. Pompeius, Aulus’ son, who was called Bithynicus, perhaps two years older than me, had great eagerness to study, much training, and incredible application and industry. And I should know: for he was associated with me and with M. Piso [M. Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus (<span class="bold">104</span>)] both in friendship and also through studies and exercises. His delivery did not do justice to his style; for in the latter there was sufficient fullness, but in the former there was little charm.</p>
