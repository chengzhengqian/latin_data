<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] To the same time [as C. Sextius Calvinus (<span class="bold">70A</span>) and other orators of the late 2nd century BC] belonged M. Brutus, who was a great stain on your family, Brutus, in that, although he had such a distinguished name and a father who was a very good man and a most knowledgeable legal expert, he regularly undertook prosecutions, like Lycurgus at Athens.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_339_1" id="target_note_LCL540_339_1"><sup>1</sup></a> He did not seek public office, but was a vehement and annoying prosecution lawyer, so that you could readily see how a certain natural gift derived from his stock had degenerated through the vice of depraved intention.</p>
