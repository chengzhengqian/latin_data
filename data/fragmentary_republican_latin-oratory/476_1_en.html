<p class="noindent">He [Caesar] left several speeches, including some that are referred to as his on insufficient evidence [cf. T 10]. Augustus believes, not without reason, that [the speech] on behalf of Quintus Metellus [Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos, cos. 57 BC] was rather taken down by shorthand writers, who were scarcely following the words he was speaking, than published by the man [Caesar] himself; for in some copies I find even that it is not entitled “For Metellus,” but “Which he wrote for Metellus,” although the discourse purports to be from Caesar’s lips, defending Metellus and himself against the charges of their shared detractors. [4] Augustus also believes that [the address] to the soldiers in Hispania is hardly his; this speech, however, circulates in two versions, one purporting to have been spoken at the first battle, the other at the second, about which Asinius Pollio [C. Asinius Pollio (<span class="bold">174</span>), <span class="italic">FRHist</span> 56 F6] says that, because of the sudden onslaught of the enemy, he did not even have time to deliver a speech.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL541_449_1" id="target_note_LCL541_449_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
