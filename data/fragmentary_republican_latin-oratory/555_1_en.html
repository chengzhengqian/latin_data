year, in the consulship [65 BC] of L. Cotta [L. Aurelius Cotta] and L. Torquatus [L. Manlius Torquatus (<span class="bold">109</span>)], when this speech was delivered by Cicero, after he had recently completed his praetorship [66 BC], when Manilius [tr. pl. 66 BC], who had disturbed the trial through the leaders of gangs, had first appeared, then, since according to a decree of the Senate both consuls &lt;...&gt; were overseeing that trial, had not answered and had been convicted [in absence], Cominius recovered himself, so that he removed the defamation of having accepted money, and charged Cornelius again under the law of treason. The proceedings were carried out amid great expectation. Cornelius brought few companions to court, terrified by the outcome for Manilius &lt;...&gt;, so that not even a shout arose from his advocates.... The matter was carried out amid a large mass of people and great expectation as to what the result of the trial would be. &lt;...&gt; They noted that testimonies were given by the most distinguished men and that the defendant admitted what they said. The speech of the prosecutor Cominius is extant; and it is worth taking into one’s hands, not only because of Cicero’s orations that we have on behalf of Cornelius, but also for its own sake.</p>
