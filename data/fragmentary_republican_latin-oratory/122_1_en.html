<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">exile in Asia (</span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 94; Posid. </span>FGrHist<span class="italic"> 87 F 27; Ath. 4, p.168d). The trial came to be seen as an example of a wrongful condemnation of a virtuous and innocent person (Cic. </span>Font.<span class="italic"> 38; Val. Max. 6.4.4; Vell. Pat. 2.13.2). Cicero visited Rutilius in Smyrna in 78 BC and allegedly learned from him stories about orators and politicians of an earlier generation (Cic. </span>Rep.<span class="italic">1.13; </span>Brut<span class="italic">. 85 [</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">19</span></span><span class="italic"> F 16]).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 3</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Brutus</span></p>
<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] When he [Rutilius], though perfectly innocent, had been brought to that trial by which, as we know, the Republic was profoundly rent asunder, while at that time L. Crassus [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>)] and M. Antonius [<span class="bold">65</span>], ex-consuls, most eloquent men, were around, he did not wish to invoke the aid of either of them. He spoke himself in his own defense, and C. Cotta [C. Aurelius Cotta (<span class="bold">80</span>), F 8–9], since he was the son of his sister, added a few words ...and Q. Mucius [Q. Mucius Scaevola (<span class="bold">67</span>), F 7–8] spoke, precisely indeed and in a carefully finished manner, as he was accustomed to, but in no way with that fire and fullness that this kind of trial and the significance of the case demanded.</p>
