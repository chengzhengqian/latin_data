<p class="noindent">With reference to his [Scipio’s] eulogy there is extant the speech by C. Laelius Sapiens, which Q. Fabius Maximus [Q. Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus (<span class="bold">49</span>), F2–3] seems to have used in the eulogy of the dead Scipio, in the finalsection of which the following words can be found: “Therefore, neither so much gratitude can be offered to the immortal gods as should be offered, because this man was born with that mind and intellect in this community out of all, nor can it be borne with grief and pain as it should be borne, because he died in that way and perished at the very same time when both for you and for all who wish this Republic safe there is very much the need for him to be alive, Romans.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 23</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Pro Murena</span></p>
<p class="noindent">...when on that man’s last day Maximus [Q. Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus (<span class="bold">49</span>), F2–3] eulogized him [Africanus], he gave thanks to the immortal gods because that man had been born in this Republic out of all; for it had been necessary for the world’s government to be where he was.</p>
