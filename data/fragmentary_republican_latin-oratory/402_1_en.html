<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] C. Macer was always deficient in authority, but as a pleader he was almost the most diligent. If his way of life, if his character, if even his mien had not taken away any recommendation of his talent, he would have had a greater name among the pleaders. His language was not copious, yet not meager; not too brilliant, not completely crude; his voice, his gesture, and his whole delivery were without charm; but in collection and arrangement of material there was an amazing care, so that I have scarcely seen it more diligent and greater in anyone, but of such a kind that you would rather call it characteristic of adroit routine than oratory. Though he won recognition also in criminal cases, he nonetheless held a more conspicuous place in civil suits.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Atticus</span>:] For why should I mention &lt;M&gt;acer [in a list of historiographers]? His loquacity has some adroitness of expression, and that not from that wealth of knowledge of the Greeks, though, but from the Roman copyists; yet in his speeches there are many absurdities and even the greatest impudence.
