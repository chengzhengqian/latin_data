<p class="noindent">In the first place, then, as regards cast of features and look and bearing, Tiberius was gentle and sedate, while Gaius was high-strung and vehement, so that, even when speaking to the People, the one stood composedly in one spot, while the other was the first Roman to walk around on the Rostra and pull his toga off his shoulder as he spoke ... [3] In the second place, the speech of Gaius was awe-inspiring and passionate to exaggeration, while that of Tiberius was more agreeable and more conducive to pity. And that man’s style was pure and carefully elaborated, while that of Gaius was persuasive and ornate. [4] ... [5] And in their tempers they were different as in their speech: the one [Tiberius] was reasonable and gentle, the other [Gaius] harsh and fiery, so that against his better judgment he was often carried away by anger when speaking, raised his voice to a high pitch, uttered abuse, and threw the oration into disorder. [6] Therefore, he even created a remedy against such digressions: Licinius, a not-unintelligent slave, who stood behind Gaius when he was speaking, with a sounding instrument by which one gives the tones of the voice their pitch; whenever he noticed that he [Gaius] was getting harsh and broken in his voice because of anger, he would give out a soft note, whereupon he would at once remit the vehemence of his passion and of his speech, grow gentle, and show himself easily reined in.</p>
