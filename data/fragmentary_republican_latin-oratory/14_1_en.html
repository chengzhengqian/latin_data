<p class="noindent">I would be making many twists and turns around a single matter, if I wished to go through everything in which writers differ concerning the death of Marcellus. [13] Not to mention others, Coelius [L. Coelius Antipater, Roman historian at end of 2nd cent. BC; <span class="italic">FRHist</span> 15] provides a threefold record of the event: one as transmitted by tradition, a second the eulogy, written down, by the son, who was present at the event, a third that he himself adds as investigated and discovered by him. [14] In any case, the reports vary in such a way that, still, most writers relate that he [Marcellus] left the camp to explore the locality and all that he was overwhelmed by an ambush.</p>
