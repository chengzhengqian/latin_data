<p class="noindent">I have read the letter [from C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>) to L. Herennius Balbus (<span class="bold">163</span>)]. A good deal about my <span class="italic">Cato</span>; he [Caesar] says that by reading it very often his diction has become fuller, whereas after reading Brutus’ <span class="italic">Cato</span> he seemed eloquent to himself.</p>

<p class="noindent">Our Brutus has sent me his speech delivered to a public meeting on the Capitol and asked me to correct it candidly before he publishes it. And the speech is indeed written most elegantly, with sentiments and wording so that nothing could be better. Still, if I had dealt with that matter, I would have written with more fire. You see what the nature of the theme &lt;and&gt; the person of the speaker is.
