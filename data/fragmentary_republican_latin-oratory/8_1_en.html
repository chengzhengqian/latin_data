<p class="noindent">Seeing both the greatness of the task of running the Republic and the large number of wars, he [Fabius Maximus] trained his body for the wars like natural armor and his speech as an instrument of persuasion with the People, thus shaped in a way right well befitting his manner of life. [8] For there was no affectation nor any empty and forensic grace, but a mind having a peculiar form and weight in an abundance of maxims, which, they say, most resembled those of Thucydides. [9] And a speech of his is preserved, which he delivered before the People, as a eulogy of his son, who had died after his consulship.</p>

<p class="noindent">And the son of Fabius happened to die, and this affliction he bore with the greatest equanimity, like a wise man and a good father. The funeral eulogy, which the kinsmen offer at the obsequies of illustrious men, he delivered himself, standing in the Forum, and then he wrote out the speech and published it.</p>
