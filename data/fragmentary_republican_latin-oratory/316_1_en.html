<p class="noindent">And the whole matter stands as follows: therein that point has to be explained first, about which Metellus he [Cicero] says this. For at that time there were several Quinti Metelli, of whom two were ex-consuls, Pius and Creticus, about whom it is clear that he is not talking, and two young men, Nepos and Celer, of whom he now means Nepos. For his father Q. Metellus Nepos, son of Baliaricus, grandson of Macedonicus, who was consul with T. Didius [98 BC], was accused by the Curio about whom he talks; and that Metellus, on his deathbed, entreated his son, this Metellus, that he should accuse Curio, his own accuser, and he bound him by oath that he would do so.</p>
