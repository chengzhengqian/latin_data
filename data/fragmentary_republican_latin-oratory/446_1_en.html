planning the entire endeavor of his Tribunate [62 BC] for my destruction, I addressed myself to Claudia, your wife, and to your [half-]sister Mucia, whose friendly disposition toward me on account of my friendship with Pompey [Cn. Pompeius Magnus (<span class="bold">111</span>), husband of Mucia] I had noticed in many matters, so that they should deter him from that injurious design. [7] And yet, as I believe you have heard, on the day before the Kalends of January [last day of December 63 BC] he laid an insult that has never been laid upon anyone in any magistracy, even the most disloyal citizen, upon me, a consul, although I had saved the Republic: he deprived me of the opportunity to address a public meeting when retiring from office. His affront, however, was a source of the greatest honor to me: for, when he permitted me nothing except my taking the oath, I swore in loud tones the truest and finest oath, and the People likewise in loud tones swore that I had sworn the truth. [8] Even after receiving so signal an insult, still, on that very same day, I sent mutual friends to Metellus, who were to negotiate with him so that he might drop this attitude. He replied to them that his hands were no longer free; and, in fact, he had declared at a public meeting a little earlier that one who had punished others without a hearing ought not to be given the opportunity to speak himself.</p>
