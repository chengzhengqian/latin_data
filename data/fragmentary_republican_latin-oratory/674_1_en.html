<p class="noindent">But when matters at Rome came to a crisis, with the aristocratic party attaching itself to Pompey [Cn. Pompeius Magnus (<span class="bold">111</span>)], who was present, and the popular party summoning Caesar [C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)] from Gaul, where he was in arms, [2] Curio, the friend of Antony [M. Antonius (<span class="bold">159</span>)], now favoring the cause of Caesar, as a result of a change of sides, brought Antony over to it. And having great influence with the masses from his eloquence and making lavish use of money that Caesar had supplied, he [Curio] got Antony appointed Tribune of the People [for 49 BC], then one of the priests who observe the birds and who are called augurs [in 50 BC].</p>

<p class="noindent">...and Curio [was elected] Tribune of the People [for 50 BC], he too a bitter enemy of Caesar [C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)], and extremely charming toward the People, and a most accomplished speaker.</p>

<p class="noindent">Meanwhile [in 50 BC], wishing to arrange matters at home beforehand in some fashion so as not to seem to be using violence indiscriminately, but also persuasion, he [C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)] decided to reconcile himself with Curio.
