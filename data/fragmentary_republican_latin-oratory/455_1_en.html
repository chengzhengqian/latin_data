<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Messalla</span>:] In the nineteenth year of his life L. Crassus [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>), F 13–14] prosecuted C. Carbo [C.

Asinius Pollio (<span class="bold">174</span>), F 15–18] all undertook very important cases long before the age of the quaestorship, it is attested that some pleaded while wearing boys’ clothing, and Caesar Augustus gave the funeral eulogy of his grandmother from the front of the Rostra at the age of twelve.</p>
