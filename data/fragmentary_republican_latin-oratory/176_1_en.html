<p class="noindent">In Q. Metellus Numidicus, in the third book of his accusation of Valerius Messalla, we have noted something said in a novel way. [2] The words from his speech are as follows: “when he knew that he had incurred so grave an accusation and that the allies had come to the Senate in tears, to complain that they had been exacted enormous sums of money.” [3] He says “that &lt;they&gt; had been exacted &lt;enormous&gt; sums of money,” instead of “that enormous sums of money had been exacted from them.” [4] This seemed to us said with a Greek construction; for the Greeks say: εἰσεπράξατό με ἀργύριον; this means “he exacted me money.” If this can be said, it can also be said “someone to have been exacted money”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_353_1" id="target_note_LCL540_353_1"><sup>1</sup></a> ...</p>
