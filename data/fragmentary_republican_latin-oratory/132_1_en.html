<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Aper</span>:] ...if I have first said this, that the forms and types of oratory also change with the times. Thus, compared with the old Cato [M. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">8</span>)], C. Gracchus is fuller and richer; thus Crassus [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>)] is more finished and ornate than Gracchus; thus Cicero is more lucid, more elegant, and more profound than either of them; compared with Cicero, Corvinus [M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus (<span class="bold">176</span>)] is mellower, sweeter, and more elaborate in the choice of words.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Messalla</span>:] Moreover, if, with that supreme and perfect form of eloquence discounted, a style of speaking were to be chosen, I should indeed prefer the vigor of C. Gracchus or the maturity of L. Crassus [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>)] to the curling tongs of Maecenas or the jangling sound of Gallio [L. Iunius Gallio, senator and friend of Seneca the Elder]: for it is so much better to clothe the speech even in a shaggy toga than to adorn it with the gay-colored garments of a courtesan.</p>
