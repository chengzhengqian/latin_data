<p class="noindent">Now arriving quickly, since he [Cicero] saw that this was being aimed for, namely that from the praetor &lt;M’.&gt; Glabrio [M’. Acilius Glabrio, praet. urb. 70, cos. 67 BC] and from those judges who were in post at the time the whole matter was to be deferred to another year and another praetor and the defendant to be snatched away from him through the support of Hortensius and Metellus, who were then future consuls [for 69 BC] (on account of them Verres had assumed complete confidence of evading the trial), he devised this plan, namely that he forwent a long speech and did not take up time on piling up reproaches in a set speech, but merely called witnesses for each crime listed and presented them to Hortensius for questioning: by this artifice Hortensius was so worn out that he could not find anything to say in opposition; even Verres himself, despairing of his support, went off into exile of his own accord.</p>
