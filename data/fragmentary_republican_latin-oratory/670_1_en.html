<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Q. Pilius Celer (</span>RE<span class="italic"> Pilius 2) is often mentioned in Cicero’s letters (esp. Cic. </span>Att.<span class="italic"> 10.1.4; </span>Ad Brut.<span class="italic"> 2.5.3–4). He fought for C. Iulius Caesar (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">121</span></span><span class="italic">) in Gaul and was on his side in the civil war.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">rit<span class="italic">” (cf. Cic. </span>Rab. post.<span class="italic"> 9) since he probably assumed that Servilius had received the money; his application for prosecution was not accepted by the praetor M. Iuventius Laterensis (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">167</span></span><span class="italic">) (</span>TLRR <span class="italic">337). Thereupon, Pilius proceeded toprosecute Servilius for extortion, when Ap. Claudius Pulcher (son of C. Claudius Pulcher) intervened; he asserted that Servilius had received a bribe of three million sesterces from his father. As a result of a procedural error of Laterensis, Servilius was neither acquitted nor convicted. Yet, Ap. Claudius Pulcher did not pursue the matter further; thus, Pilius was able to go ahead with the prosecution.</span></p>
