[6] He says that I am not showing the same severity in speaking now on behalf of L. Murena that I used in expelling Catiline from the city [of Rome] through my words [cf. Cic. <span class="italic">Cat.</span> 1] and virtually through my magisterial power when he was contriving the destruction of the Republic inside the city walls....

And of these three parts, that first one, which should have been the most serious, was so feeble and trivial that a sort of convention of accusers rather than any true opportunity for abuse compelled them to say something about L. Murena’s private life. For Asia was laid to his charge ... [13] Cato calls L. Murena a dancer. This is a reproach, if the criticism is true, from a forceful prosecutor; if it is false, from an abusive slanderer....
