fact that he censures my gloom as well as my jesting is a weighty argument that I was moderate in both. You said that bequests do not come my way.... [42] ... Was it to gather together these points [allegations against Cicero], you madman, that you spent all these days declaiming in a country house that does not belong to you? ... [48] He who is reminding me of the favors he has done for me was rather intimate with Clodius during the latter’s tribunate [58 BC].... [49] ... I wonder why, therefore, you say that Milo committed that deed at my prompting, since, when you offered me the same service of your own accord, I never encouraged you.... [70] But how frequently he employs the phrase “both the consul and Antony”! This is to say “both the consul and an utterly shameless fellow,” “both the consul and a completely worthless fellow.” For what else is Antony? ... [76] ... He was even asking why I turned back so suddenly in the middle of my journey [cf. F 14].... [111] You ask whether the sacred couch, the gable, the special priest [honors for Caesar; cf. Suet. <span class="italic">Iul.</span> 76] have my approval. Certainly not; none of this has my approval. But you, who defend Caesar’s acts, what can you say as to why you defend some acts and do not care for others? ... [112] But let us leave aside what is past: this one day, this single one, I say, the present day, this point of time in which I speak: defend it if you can. Why is the Senate surrounded by a circle of armed men, why do your henchmen hear me with swords, why are the doors of the Temple of Concord not open, why do you bring into the Forum the most barbarous men of all nations, Ituraeans, with arrows? He says he does it for his protection.</p>
