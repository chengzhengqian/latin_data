<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] But by far the greatest rascal in the memory of mankind was C. Servilius Glaucia, yet very shrewd and clever, and particularly good at provoking laughter. Rising from the lowest condition of fortune and circumstances of life, he would have been made consul while still praetor if it had been held that his candidacy could be legally considered. For he both held sway over the People and had the equestrian order bound to him through the benefits resulting from the law. While praetor, he was put to death in the name of the state, on the same day as Saturninus [L. Appuleius Saturninus (<span class="bold">64A</span>)], the Tribune of the People, in the consulship of Marius and Flaccus [100 BC]. [He was] a man very similar to the Athenian Hyperbolus [Athenian politician, ostracized in 416 or 415 BC], whose shamelessness old Attic comedies have branded [e.g., Ar. <span class="italic">Eq.</span> 1304, 1362–63; <span class="italic">Nub.</span> 551–62, 623–26, 1065–66; <span class="italic">Pax</span> 681–92, 921, 1319; <span class="italic">Ach.</span> 845; <span class="italic">Ran. </span>570; <span class="italic">Vesp.</span>1007].</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Crassus</span>:] I do not approve of it being said that by Africanus’ [P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus minor’s (<span class="bold">21</span>)] death the Republic was “castrated,” I do not approve of Glaucia being called “the excrement of the Senate house” [cf. F 4]: however much of a similarity there is, still, in both cases, the thought of the similarity is unseemly.</p>
