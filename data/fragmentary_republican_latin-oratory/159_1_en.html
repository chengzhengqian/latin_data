<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Cicero trained with Scaevola (T 2; Cic. </span>Amic. <span class="italic">1); Scaevola is an interlocutor in Cicero’s </span>De re publica<span class="italic"> (Cic. </span>Rep.<span class="italic">1.18) and in the first book of </span>De oratore<span class="italic"> (Cic. </span>Att.<span class="italic"> 4.16.3).</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">In Cicero, Scaevola is said not to have been an outstanding orator and to have often obtained the Senate’s approval in important matters when he spoke briefly and in a fairly unpolished way (T 1, 5).</span></p>

Albucius [<span class="bold">64</span>]. He was not reckoned among the orators; but in understanding of civil law and in all kinds of knowledge he was supreme.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero:</span>] In the study of civil law, however, I devoted much attention to Q. Scaevola, Quintus’ son, who, though he offered himself to nobody as a teacher, still, by the legal replies given to people consulting him, taught those eager to listen to him.</p>
