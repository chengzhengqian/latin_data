<p class="noindent">Gracchus [Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">34</span>)], keen to win the favor of the People by a payment, put forward a law, that the money that had belonged to Attalus [king of Pergamum, d. 133 BC] was to be distributed among the People [see <span class="bold">17</span> F 3]. When Nasica [P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio (<span class="bold">38</span>)] opposed it, Pompeius too pledged that he would prosecute Gracchus as soon as he had resigned from office.</p>

<p class="noindent">...the defeated ones [citizens unhappy with Gracchus’ agrarian law] still remained [in Rome], feeling aggrieved, and claimed that, as soon as Gracchus should become a private citizen, he would be sorry that he had insulted the sacred and inviolable office and had brought so great a source of strife into Italy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_171_1" id="target_note_LCL540_171_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

Sempronius Gracchus’ actions and implies plans to oppose him once this has become possible after he has stood down from office (as in Q. Pompeius’ announcement). There is no mention of Q. Pompeius, however, and the dissatisfaction concerns the agrarian law rather than the funds from King Attalus.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL540_171_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
