provided against Staienus by those who served under Mam. Aemilius [Mam. Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, cos. 77 BC], a very distinguished man, as generals, prefects, and military tribunes; by their evidence it was made obvious that it was chiefly through his [Staienus’] activity, when he was quaestor [77 BC], that mutiny was stirred up in the army. I do not even read out the evidence that was given about the 600,000 sesterces that he had accepted on behalf of Safinius’ trial [76 BC; cf. Cic. <span class="italic">Clu.</span> 68; <span class="italic">TLRR</span> 142] and then, as afterward at Oppianicus’ trial [74 BC; <span class="italic">TLRR</span> 149], kept secret and concealed. [100] I pass over this and very many other things that were said against Staienus at that trial. I say this, that P. and L. Cominius, Roman knights, honorable and eloquent men, then had the same quarrel with Staienus, whom they were accusing, that I now have with Attius [T. Accius Pisaurensis (<span class="bold">145</span>), the prosecutor]. The Cominii said the same that I say, that Staienus took money from Oppianicus to bribe the court; Staienus said that he took it to effect a reconciliation. [101] There was laughter at this reconciliation of his and his assuming the role of an honest man, as he had done in the matter of the gilt statues that he erected in the Temple of Iuturna [in Rome] and to which he added an inscription at the foot, recording the kings whom he had restored to friendship [with Rome]. Then all his dishonest practices and impostures were driven out; a whole lifetime spent in pursuits of that kind was disclosed; his personal poverty and his source of income from the courts were brought to light; his pose as the paid agent of peace and goodwill did not win approval. Thus at the time Staienus, when answering the same charge as Attius is now, was found guilty. [102] The Cominii, doing what I have been doing all through the case, proved their point.</p>
