What Quintilian refers to might be a separate, written version, perhaps not even by Hortensius himself.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] Thus, after I had been involved in very many cases and been among the leading pleaders for about five years, then, in support of the Sicilians, as aedile designate [70 BC], I entered a duel of the highest magnitude with the consul designate, Hortensius.</p>

<p class="noindent">To these [reasons for asking Cicero to act as the prosecutor] was added that a victory [by Cicero] concerning Verres would not be undistinguished for the reason that he was defended by the Metelli, the Scipiones and many other noblemen and especially by Hortensius himself, easily both the foremost man in the Senate because of his nobility and the king of trials in the Forum because of his eloquence, and also a consul designate with Q. Metellus [Q. Caecilius Metellus Creticus, cos. 69 BC], the brother of the Metelli, of whom one was praetor in Sicily and the other praetor in the city.</p>
