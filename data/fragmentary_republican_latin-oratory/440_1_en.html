 your own.... [18] ... “He was a candidate for the quaestorship at the same time, and I was elected first [alleged statement of Sulpicius; quaest. prob. 74 BC].” ... [21] The highest distinction, the greatest prestige can be found in both of them [Sulpicius and Murena]; for my part, if Servius permitted me to do so, I should assign the same and equal praise. But he does not permit it; he ridicules the profession of arms, he attacks the whole of this legateship, he thinks that the consulship is a matter of persistent attention to these daily tasks. “You [Murena] have been away with the army,” he [Sulpicius] says; “for so many years you have not approached the Forum; you have been away for such a long time and, now that you have come after such a long gap, are you competing for office with these men who have made their homes in the Forum?” ... [35] “But in the election for the praetorship [of 65 BC] Servius was declared elected first.” [alleged objection] Are you going to suggest to the People that they are obliged, as if under contract, to give a man &lt;in&gt; all subsequent magistracies the same position for a magistracy that they have given him once? ... [73] ... These charges relating to retinues, shows, dinners, have all alike been put down by the population to your excessive officiousness, Servius; yet, as regards those, Murena is defended by the authority of the Senate. What then? Surely the Senate does not regard it as a crime to go out to meet a candidate? “No; only for payment.” Prove that it was. To have many escorting? “No; only if they were hired.” Show that they were. To provide a seat at a show or give an invitation to dinner? “Not at all; unless it was given indiscriminately, throughout the city.” What does “indiscriminately” mean? “To everybody.”</p>
