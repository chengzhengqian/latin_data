<p class="noindent">Or perhaps you [T. Labienus, the present prosecutor] believe that I should reply at some length to you concerning the holy places and groves that you have said had been violated by this man here [Rabirius]; as regards this charge nothing has ever been said by you, except that this charge was brought against C. Rabirius by C. Macer. With respect to this, I am amazed that you remembered what Macer, his enemy, charged C. Rabirius with but forgot what impartial judges decided under oath.</p>
