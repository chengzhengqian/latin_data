Lucullus also were sitting there! What enmities in this community were ever more bitter than those between the Luculli and Servilius? And yet, in such most worthy men, their regard for public &lt;benefit&gt; and their own honor not only extinguished those [enmities], but even transformed them into friendship and intimacy.</p>

<p class="noindent">“I shall do this &lt;not&gt; as something novel, but it has previously been done by those who are now leading men in our community.” He [Cicero] says what is true; for L. Lucullus and equally M. Lucullus [M. Licinius Lucullus (<span class="bold">91</span>)] were both ex-consuls, and Marcus was also a former triumphator. When these men accused L.

Servilius, but Gruen (1971, 54–55) argues that it is unlikely to be a scribal error and that other details in this note are correct. Gruen therefore assumes another prosecution by the brothers Luculli, perhaps of the L. Cotta who was a Tribune of the People in 103 and a praetor in the 90s BC (see also Schütz 1994, 49–50). Such a trial would  have to be dated to a later stage in the careers of the Luculli since according to F 5 Lucullus was not active in the Forum or even in Rome for some time as a younger man, apart from the personally motivated prosecution of Servilius. That Lucullus is seen as a forensic speaker and as someone appearing in the Forum (T 1, 2, 3) might suggest that he was involved in more than the single trial securely attested.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL541_157_1-1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL541_157_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL541_157_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>Seen as a mistake for C.
