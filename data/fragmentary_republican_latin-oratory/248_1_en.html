<p class="noindent">And the censors [97 BC] M. Antonius [<span class="bold">65</span>] and L. Flaccus [L. Valerius Flaccus] expelled Duronius from the Senate because, as Tribune of the Plebs, he had revoked a law passed to limit money spent on dinner parties. A remarkable reason for a stigma: for how impudently does Duronius ascend the Rostra to speak as follows: “Bridles have been laid upon you, Romans, in no way tolerable. You have been bound and tied with a galling chain of slavery: for a law has been passed that orders you to be frugal. Let us then revoke that regulation, overlaid with the rust of rugged antiquity. For indeed, what use is liberty if those who want to are not allowed to go to perdition through luxury?”</p>
