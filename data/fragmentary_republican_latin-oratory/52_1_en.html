Scipio Aemilianus Africanus minor (<span class="bold">21</span>)], C. Laelius, and L. Furius [L. Furius Philus (<span class="bold">26</span>)], who had the most learned men from Greece about themselves at all times and in public.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Crassus</span>:] For my own part, when I listen to my mother-in-law Laelia—for women keep the old pronunciation unspoiled more easily, as they do not take part in the conversations of the multitude and so always retain what they learned initially—but I listen to her so that I believe I am listening to Plautus or Naevius; she has such an unaffected and natural sound of voice that she seems to introduce no trace of display or affectation; hence I infer that her father and her ancestors spoke like this: not harshly, like the person I mentioned [Q. Valerius Soranus], nor in a coarse manner, nor in a countrified way, nor with a jerky pronunciation, but neatly and evenly and smoothly.</p>

<p class="noindent">“You certainly have often defended, Laelius,” he [<span class="sc">Scipio</span>] said, “many cases in such a way that I [would not compare] with you not only Servius Galba [Ser. Sulpicius Galba (<span class="bold">19</span>)], our colleague [as augur], whom you put before everyone as long as he was alive, but not even any of the Attic orators either in cha&lt;rm...&gt;.”</p>
