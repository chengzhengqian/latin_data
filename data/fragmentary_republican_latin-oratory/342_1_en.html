defending the life, the good name, and the property of another, should have to plead my cause first—above all, when Q. Hortensius, who &lt;in&gt; this trial fulfills the part of the prosecutor, upon whom nature has lavishly bestowed the greatest command of the resources of oratory and the greatest ability to speak, is going to speak against me?</p>
