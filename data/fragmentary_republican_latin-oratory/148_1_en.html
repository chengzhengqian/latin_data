<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">C.

<p class="noindent">And so Gaius Gracchus was Tribune a second time [122 BC].... [92] He transferred the courts of justice, which had become discredited through bribery, to the knights from the senators, reproaching them especially with the recent examples, namely that Aurelius Cotta [L. Aurelius Cotta, cos. 144 BC; cf. P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus minor (<span class="bold">21</span>), F 23–26], Salinator [otherwise unknown, ca. 130 BC], and, the third after them, Manius Aquillius [cos. 129 BC; cf. P. Cornelius Lentulus (<span class="bold">15</span>), F2], who conquered Asia, manifest bribe-takers, had been acquitted by the judges, while ambassadors sent to complain about them were still present and, going round, uttered bitter accusations. The Senate was extremely ashamed of these things and yielded to the law, and the People ratified it. [93] And in this way the courts were transferred to the knights from the Senate. They say that soon after the passage of this law Gracchus remarked that he had broken the power of the Senate completely, and the statement of Gracchus came to the test more strongly as events progressed.</p>
