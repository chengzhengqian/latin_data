<p class="noindent">Q. Servilius Caepio [<span class="bold">85</span> F 3] took Scaurus to court, because of the resentment on account of the Asian embassy, for taking money against the law, under the law on the recovery of extorted money that Servilius Glaucia [C. Servilius Glaucia (<span class="bold">58b</span>)] put forward [<span class="italic">Lex Servilia repetundarum</span>: <span class="italic">LPPR</span>, p.322]. Scaurus was of such self-control and greatness of mind that, in return, he charged Caepio and, having obtained an earlier date for the investigation, achieved that the other should plead his case first; he also urged M. Drusus, the Tribune of the People [M. Livius Drusus (<span class="bold">72</span>), tr. pl. 91 BC], to modify the courts [i.e., change the composition of juries].</p>
