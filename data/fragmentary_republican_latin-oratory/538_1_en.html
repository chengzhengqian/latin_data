<p class="noindent">On the seventh day before the Ides of February [February 7, 56 BC] Milo [T. Annius Milo (<span class="bold">138</span>)] appeared. Pompey [Cn. Pompeius Magnus (<span class="bold">111</span>)] spoke [in support of Milo] ...but when he came to the end, Clodius rose: he received such a clamor from our side (for it had been decided to repay the compliment), that he did not retain control of his thoughts, tongue, and countenance. That situation, with Pompey having finished just at the sixth hour, lasted until the eighth hour, when all manner of insults and, at the end, highly scabrous verses were uttered against Clodius and Clodia. That man, furious and pale, started to ask his followers, in the middle of the shouting, who it was who was starving the commons to death. The gang answered: “Pompey.” Who wanted to go to Alexandria. They answered: “Pompey.” Whom they wanted to go. They answered: “Crassus” [M. Licinius Crassus Dives (<span class="bold">102</span>)] (he was present at the time, not with a friendly mind toward Milo). At around the ninth hour the Clodians started spitting at our men, as though on a signal. Resentment flared up. They made a push to dislodge us from our place. There was a countercharge from our side. The flight of the gang; Clodius hurled from the Rostra. And we too then fled, fearing that something [might happen] in the mêlée.... Clodius had the trial postponed to the Quirinalia [February 17].</p>
