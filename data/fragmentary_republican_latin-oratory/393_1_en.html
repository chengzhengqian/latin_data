 that law. Quinctius should have waited a few days. But he did not wish to prosecute as a private person [after the end of his term of office] or when the popular prejudice had already subsided. So you see that the entire hope of the prosecutor relied not on the merits of his case, but on the timing and his power. [91] He demanded a fine. Under what law? Because he had not taken the official oath on the law, a matter that has never been held criminal in anyone, and because C. Verres, the city praetor [in 74 BC], an upright and scrupulous man, did not have a note of his having filled up a vacancy among the judges in that record that was then produced, full of erasures [cf. Cic. <span class="italic">Verr. </span>2<span class="italic">.</span>1<span class="italic">.</span>157<span class="italic">–</span>58]. For these reasons, very trivial and very insubstantial, C. Iunius was convicted, judges, reasons that ought not to have been admitted before the court at all.... [92] Do you think that this trial ought to do harm to Cluentius? For what reason? If Iunius had not appointed a substitute according to the law or if at some point he had not taken an official oath on some law, then, for that reason, by his conviction, was any judgment made about Cluentius? “No,” he [Quinctius] says; “but he [Iunius] was convicted under those laws for the reason that he had committed an offense against another law.” Can those who admit this maintain equally that this was a trial? “Well,” he says, “the Roman People were then hostile to C. Iunius for the reason that this court [at Oppianicus’ trial] was believed to have been corrupted through him.” ... [93] ... A Tribune of the People prosecuted him [Iunius], at public meetings as well as at the benches in court; he came into court not only straight from a public meeting, but even along with the meeting itself. Those Aurelian steps, new then, seemed to have been built as an auditorium
