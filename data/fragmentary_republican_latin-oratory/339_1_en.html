<p class="noindent">... and M. [Tullius] Cicero believes [like Demosthenes] that delivery alone rules in oratory [cf. Cic. <span class="italic">De or. </span>3<span class="italic">.</span>213]. [8] He transmits that therein ... Antonius [M. Antonius (<span class="bold">65</span>)] and Crassus [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>)] were very powerful, but Q. Hortensius most. Testimony to this matter is that his [Hortensius’] written works are far below the reputation on account of which he was long regarded as the leading orator, for a time as Cicero’s rival, and finally, for the rest of his life, as the second, so that it is obvious that there was something pleasing in his speaking that we do not find when we read him.</p>

<p class="noindent">Whatever oration Avitus [L. Hedius Rufus Lollianus Avitus, cos. 144 AD] has put together, it will be so perfectly executed in all its aspects that in it neither would Cato [M. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">8</span>)] miss dignity nor Laelius [C. Laelius Sapiens (<span class="bold">20</span>)] smoothness nor Gracchus [C. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">48</span>)] vigor nor Caesar [C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)] passion nor &lt;H&gt;ortensius arrangement nor Calvus [C. Licinius Macer Calvus (<span class="bold">165</span>)] wittiness nor Sallust [C. Sallustius Crispus (<span class="bold">152</span>)] economy nor Cicero sumptuousness. In fact, I say, so as not to run through all of them, if you should hear Avitus, you would not wish anything added or removed or indeed anything changed.</p>
