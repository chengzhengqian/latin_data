<p class="noindent">But what concerns Piso: many of this family bore the <span class="italic">cognomen</span> relating to worthiness, but L. Piso was the first to have deserved it, he who proposed the law on the recovery of extorted money and was the archenemy of C. Gracchus; against him there is a speech of Gracchus himself, full of abuse rather than charges.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">M</span>.:] “But he [Epicurus] often praises virtue.” [comment by a fictitious interlocutor] And so did C. Gracchus indeed: after he had handed out huge gifts and poured out the funds of the treasury, still, in his words, he was the protector of the treasury. Why should I listen to words when I can see the deeds? L. Piso, that well-known Frugi, had always spoken against the grain law. When the law had been passed, he, despite being a consular, had turned up to receive grain. Gracchus notices Piso standing in the throng; he asks him in the hearing of the Roman People how he acted consistently when he sought grain under that law that he had opposed. “I would not like it, Gracchus,” he said, “that you feel like dividing up my property among all citizens; but, should you do so, I should seek my share.” Did this serious and sagacious man show insufficiently that the public inheritance was squandered by the <span class="italic">Lex Sempronia</span>? Read Gracchus’ speeches: you will say he was the patron of the treasury.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_291_1" id="target_note_LCL540_291_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
