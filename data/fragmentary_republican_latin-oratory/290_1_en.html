 Strabo (<span class="bold">73</span>), F 14] for the consulship. And this all the more because, while his colleague, the famous Sulpicius himself [<span class="bold">76</span> F 17–18] pleaded the same case, he [Antistius] said more and more penetrating things. Therefore, after his Tribunate, first many cases were brought to him, at that time all the most important of whatever sort. [227] He found the point at issue acutely, arranged his argument carefully, and had a strong memory. He used words not at all embellished, yet still not commonplace; and his speech was unencumbered and easily flowing; and its entire appearance, as it were, was not without a certain urbanity; his delivery was hampered a little by a flaw in his voice and especially from some tasteless mannerisms. He flourished in the period [87–82 BC] when, between the departure and the return of L. Sulla [L. Cornelius Sulla], the Republic was without law and without any dignity.

Papirius Carbo Arvina (<span class="bold">87</span>)] and Pomponius [Cn. Pomponius (<span class="bold">72B</span>)], both of whom he surpassed easily.</p>
