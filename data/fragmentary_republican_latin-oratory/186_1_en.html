<p><span class="italic">Catulus delivered the funeral eulogy of his mother Popilia (F 5; </span>CCMR<span class="italic">, App. A: 209). In addition, brief witty remarks have been transmitted (Cic. </span>De or.<span class="italic"> 2.220, 2.233, 2.255; Quint. </span>Inst. <span class="italic">6.3.81).</span></p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] “Now Q. Catulus, a man accomplished, not in that old style, but in our modern fashion, unless anything can be more perfect. Wide reading, a courtesy, not only in life and nature, but also in speech, a certain untainted purity of Latin diction: this can be seen both from his orations and most easily from that book that he wrote on his consulship and his own deeds, in a smooth and Xenophontic style of expression, and dedicated to the poet A. Furius, his friend [<span class="italic">FRHist </span>19 T 1]; this book is no better known than those three of Scaurus about which I have spoken before [M. Aemilius Scaurus (<span class="bold">43</span>), T1].” [133] ... “Indeed, Catulus had a pure Latin diction; such a not inconsiderable merit of style is neglected by most orators. For about the sound of his voice and the charm of his pronouncing the letters, do not expect me to say anything, since you knew his son [Q. Lutatius Catulus (<span class="bold">96</span>), T 1].... [134] Nor was the father, Catulus himself, in spite of that [his qualities as a speaker], regarded as the first among the pleaders either; instead, he was such a one that, when you heard some speak who were outstanding at the time, he seemed to be inferior, but when you heard him alone without comparison, you would not only be satisfied, but would not seek anything better.”</p>
