<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] His movement was of a kind that both C. Iulius [C. Iulius Caesar Strabo (<span class="bold">73</span>), F 12] branded it forever, when, as he [Curio] was reeling and swaying his whole body from side to side, he asked him “who is talking from a skiff?” and Cn. Sicinius [<span class="bold">98</span> T 1], a coarse man, but rather funny—and nothing else resembling an orator in him—made a jest to the same effect. [217] When, as Tribune ofthe People, he [Sicinius] had presented the consuls Curio and Octavius [76 BC] to a meeting of the People, and Curio had spoken at great length, while his colleague Cn. Octavius sat by, who was swathed in bandages and anointed with many medicinal salves because of the pain in his joints, he said: “You, Octavius, will never repay the debt to your colleague: if he had not moved about in his way, the flies would have eaten you here and now.”</p>
