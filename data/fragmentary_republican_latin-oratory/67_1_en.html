<p class="noindent">In books that we read composed about the life of P. Scipio Africanus, we have noticed it written that P. Scipio, Paulus’ son, after he had celebrated a triumph over the Carthaginians and had been censor [142 BC], was accused before the People by Claudius Asellus, a Tribune of the People, whom he had degraded from knighthood during his censorship; and that he [Scipio], although he was under accusation, neither ceased to shave his beard nor indeed not to wear white clothes, nor appeared in the usual garb of the accused. [2] But since it is certain that at that time Scipio was less than forty years old, we were surprised that this was written about shaving his beard. [3] We have learned, however, that other noblemen too in those same times were in the habit of shaving their beards at an age of that kind, and therefore we see that many portraits of the ancients, not only of old men, but in middle age, have been made in that way.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_135_1" id="target_note_LCL540_135_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p class="noindent">P. Africanus [in the speech] in his own defense against Tiberius Asellus in the matter of a fine before the People [said]: “All the evils, shameful deeds, and crimes that men commit can be assigned to two things, malice and wickedness.

Dio 48.34.3); wearing a full beard became popular again under the emperor Hadrian (Cass. Dio 68.15.5; see Mau 1897).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL540_135_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
