<p class="noindent">Nothing damaged his reputation for chastity except his intimate companionship with Nicomedes [king of Bithynia], though that was a deep and lasting reproach and exposed to insults from everyone.... I pass over the speeches of Dolabella [Cn. Cornelius Dolabella (<span class="bold">94</span>), F1] and of Curio the father, in which Dolabella calls him [Caesar] “the queen’s rival, the inner side of the royal couch,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL541_139_1" id="target_note_LCL541_139_1"><sup>1</sup></a> but Curio “the stable of Nicomedes and the brothel of Bithynia.”</p>

<p class="noindent">But so that there is no doubt at all for anyone that he was ablaze with a bad reputation for both sexual impurity [with men] and adultery, Curio the father, in some oration, calls him [Caesar] “every woman’s man and every man’s woman.”</p>

<p class="noindent">Curio the father: “under no circumstances is he removed, under no circumstances is he relieved of [paying / accepting] the money,” <span class="italic">demolitur</span> [“is removed”] he used in passive sense [normally deponent with active meaning].</p>
