<p class="noindent">But indeed, a very distinguished man, a great lover of the Republic, honored with the greatest benefits from you [the People], Q. Catulus [Q. Lutatius Catulus (<span class="bold">96</span>), F7–8], and also a man endowed with the highest gifts of position, fortune, character, and talent, Q. Hortensius, disagree with this measure. I admit that the authoritative opinion of these men has had on many occasions and ought to have the greatest weight with you; but in this case, although you have noticed that the authoritative opinions of the bravest and most illustrious men are opposed, still, we can set authoritative opinions to one side and find out the truth by considering the actual facts, and this the more easily because even these very men admit that everything that I have said hitherto is true, namely that the war is necessary and great and that in Pompey [Cn. Pompeius Magnus (<span class="bold">111</span>)] alone are all the highest qualifications. [52] What then does Hortensius say? That if the entire power is to be given to a single man, the worthiest man is Pompey; but that nevertheless the entire power ought not to be given to one man. That line of argument is now out of date, refuted by the situation far more than by words.</p>
