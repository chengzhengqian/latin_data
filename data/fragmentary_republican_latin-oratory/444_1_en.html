<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Cn. Sergius Silus, possibly an official mentioned by Cicero (Cic. </span>Verr.<span class="italic"> 2.3.102), was prosecuted by a Metellus Celer (</span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 371), who may have been this Metellus or his adoptive father, Metellus Celer (tr. pl. 90 BC).</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Metellus Celer too appeared as a stern chastiser of lascivious intent by summoning Cn. Sergius Silus to trial before the People on account of money promised to the matron of a household and convicting him on this sole charge: for not an act, but a state of mind was then brought to the judicial investigation, and having wished to do wrong hurt more than not having done wrong helped.</p>
