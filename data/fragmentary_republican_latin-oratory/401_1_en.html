<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">As consul in 65 BC, Torquatus spoke in support of L.

<p class="noindent">Furthermore, your father, Torquatus [L. Manlius Torquatus (<span class="bold">146</span>)], when he was consul [65 BC] defended Catiline—an immoderate man, but a suppliant; reckless perhaps, but once a friend—concerning a charge of extorting money.

In Cicero, Macer is described as an able pleader, while his fame wasmarred by his character. His language was unremarkable, and his delivery was not particularly impressive; his speeches were characterized by careful collection and arrangement of the material (T 1).</span></p>
