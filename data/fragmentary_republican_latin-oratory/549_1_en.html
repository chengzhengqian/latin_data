<span class="label"><span class="italic">On Cn. Pompeius Magnus in the Senate (F 12A)</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In 49 BC Calidius put forward a motion concerning Cn. Pompeius Magnus (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">111</span></span><span class="italic">) at a meeting of the Senate.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Some had made milder proposals [than Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica (<span class="bold">154</span>)], such as...M. Calidius, who proposed that Pompey [Cn. Pompeius Magnus (<span class="bold">111</span>)] leave for his provinces so that there should not be any cause for fighting; Caesar [C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)] was afraid, he said, after two of his legions had been snatched away by him, that Pompey might seem to be holding them in reserve and keeping them near the city [of Rome] as a threat against him. Or such as M. Rufus [M. Caelius Rufus (<span class="bold">162</span>)], who supported Calidius’ proposal with just a few amendments. [4] All these men, rebuked with abuse from L. Lentulus, the consul [L. Cornelius Lentulus Crus (<span class="bold">157</span>), F 5], had strong feelings aroused. [5] Lentulus refused outright to ask for a vote on Calidius’ proposal.</p>
