<p class="noindent">M. Tullius [Cicero in] <span class="italic">De re publica</span> 6 [?]: “the speech of Laelius, which we all have in our hands, [mentions] how pleasing to the immortal gods the pontiffs’ ladles are, and, as he writes, the Samian vessels.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">obsidium</span> [“blockade,” “protection”] is rightly used like <span class="italic">praesidium</span> [“bulwark”] or <span class="italic">subsidium</span> [“support,” “shelter”]. An authority for this is also C. Laelius [in the speech] on his own behalf before the People: “so that with us they created protection on land and on sea simultaneously.”</p>
