bought by Fannius and was his property. Of course, Fannius, that generous man, careless about money, overflowing with kindness, made a present of him to Roscius. I suppose so! [28] Since that man [Saturius] dwelt on this point for a little bit of time, I also must linger a little. You say, Saturius, that Panurgus was the private property of Fannius.... [51] ... You can now understand, C. Piso [C. Calpurnius Piso (<span class="bold">108</span>), the judge], that Roscius claimed for himself alone, nothing for the partnership [in compensation from Q. Flavius for the killing of Panurgus]. Since Saturius feels that this is clear, he does not venture to resist and fight against the truth; he discovers another byway for fraud and treachery in the same vein. [52] “I admit,” he says, “that Roscius claimed his share from Flavius; I grant that he left Fannius’ share free and untouched. But I maintain that what he obtained for himself became the common property of the partnership.” ... [56] ... Saturius persistently maintains the view that whatever a partner claims for himself becomes the property of the partnership.</p>
