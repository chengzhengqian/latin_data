<p class="noindent">Accordingly, I stood up to Metellus, your brother, face to face. For in the Senate on the Kalends of January [January 1, 62 BC] I argued with him about the state of the Republic in such a way that he felt that he had to fight with a man of courage and resolution. In a speech on the third day before the Nones of January [January 3], when he had started to argue, he named me at every third word of his speech, he threatened me; for nothing was more certainly decided for him than to bring me down, in whatever way he could, not through due process of law, but by aggressive violence.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Kalends of January [January 1, 57 BC] arrive. You can know this better. I say what I have heard: what the turnout of the Senate then was; how great was the expectation of the People; what a gathering of delegates from all of Italy; what courage, delivery, and weighty words from P. Lentulus, the consul [P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, cos. 57 BC]; what moderation also from his colleague [Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos] toward me; when he [Metellus Nepos] had said that his enmity against me had arisen from differences in political opinion, he said that he would give it up for the sake of the senators and the condition of the Republic.</p>
