<p class="noindent">I return to our altercation. The beautiful little boy [Clodius] gets to his feet; he accuses me of having been at Baiae. False, but still. “Well,” I say, “is that like saying I have been in a secret place?” “What business,” he says, “has a man from Arpinum with the warm springs?” “Tell that to your counsel,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL542_95_1" id="target_note_LCL542_95_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I say, “who was keen to get an Arpinum man’s waters” (you know Marius’ place, of course). “How long,” he says, “are we going to put up with this king [<span class="italic">rex</span>]?” “You talk about a king,” I say, “when Rex made no mention of you?” (he had devoured Rex’ inheritance in anticipation).<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL542_95_2" id="target_note_LCL542_95_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “You have bought a house,” he says. “You might think,” I say, “he is saying: ‘you have bought judges.’” “They did not credit you on oath,” he says. “On the contrary,” I say, “twenty-five judges gave me credit, and thirty-one gave you none, as they received money in advance.” Affected by roars of applause, he fell silent and collapsed.</p>
