words in their proper meanings, but also many in a metaphorical sense, yet in such a way that you would say, not that they had usurped an alien place, but rather that they had moved into their own; furthermore, these [words] were not left loose and disjointed, but were bound together by rhythms, constructed not obviously and not in always the same manner, but rather in varied and disguised ways. [275] There were also those highlights of words and ideas that the Greeks call <span class="italic">schemata</span> [“figures”], with which, like decorations on a garment, his entire speech was embellished. Moreover, he saw clearly “the point at issue,” that [phrase] that is included in the formulae of legal experts in many places. [276] In addition there was an arrangement of subject matter full of technical skill, a gentlemanlike delivery, and, overall, a quiet and sincere manner of speaking. If then it is best to speak with charm, you should think that there is nothing better that needs to be sought than him. But since it was said by us a little while ago that there seem to be three things that the orator must effect, to teach, to please, and to move, two of these he mastered to the highest degree, so that he lucidly explained a matter in exposition and bound the minds of those who listened by charm. That third merit was absent, that by which one moves and arouses emotions, which we have described as being most powerful; there was no force and vigor: be it due to deliberate choice, since he believed that those whose language was more elevated and whose delivery was more vehement were in frenzy and delirium, or because he was not predisposed to this by nature, or because he was not used to it, or because he did not have the knowledge. The absence of this one quality for him was, if it was of no use, a lack, if it was essential, a defect. [continued by F 3]</p>
