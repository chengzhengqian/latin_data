Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">8</span>)], and other similar men; for they will only become uncouth and jejune: for, on the one hand, they will not yet be able to grasp these men’s force with their understanding, and, on the other hand, content with the style that was doubtless excellent then, but is alien to our times, they will see themselves as similar to the great men, which is the worst thing.</p>
