For thus we feel that we are praying for lasting prosperity of the Republic and happiness for this [city (?)]. The Senate in accord with the Roman People hails you Father of the Country.” To this Augustus, in tears, replied in these words—for I have given his exact words, as [I have those] of Messalla—“Having attained my highest hopes, Members of the Senate, what else have I to ask of the immortal gods than that I may retain this same unanimous approval of yours to the very end of my life?”</p>
