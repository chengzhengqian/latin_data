<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Caesar Strabo</span>:] Also, you may often humorously yield to your opponent the very point that he is making against you: for instance, C. Laelius, when some lowborn person told him that he was not worthy of his ancestors, said: “But, by Hercules, you are worthy of yours.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">from the library of King Perseus from the spoils (Plut. </span>Aem.<span class="italic"> 28.11). Africanus is a speaker in some of Cicero’s dialogues; in particular, he is the main figure in </span>De re publica<span class="italic"> (for a collection of utterances attributed to Africanus, see Astin 1967, 248–69 [with the corresponding numbers indicated here]; for a selection of fragments with commentary, see Courtney 1999, 119–24).</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">In Cicero, Africanus is described as an outstanding orator (T 1; Cic. </span>De or.<span class="italic"> 1.215; cf. T 9; Vell. Pat. 2.9.1), as someone whose utterances are characterized by pure Latinity (T 2; cf. Gell. </span>NA<span class="italic"> 2.20.5) and by </span>gravitas<span class="italic"> (T 7), and as a representative of charming language in his day (T3; cf. Quint. </span>Inst.<span class="italic"> 12.10.10). In the </span>Rhetorica ad Herennium<span class="italic"> Africanus is listed as one of the writers from whom examples for students could be drawn (</span>Rhet. Her.<span class="italic"> 4.7: </span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">25</span></span><span class="italic"> T5). Fannius is said to have described Africanus as “ironic” in the Socratic way in his </span>Annals<span class="italic"> (T 6; Cic. </span>Brut. <span class="italic">299; </span>Acad.<span class="italic"> 2.15; </span>FRHist<span class="italic"> 12 F 6). Speeches by Africanus were available in Cicero’s time (T 1).</span></p>
