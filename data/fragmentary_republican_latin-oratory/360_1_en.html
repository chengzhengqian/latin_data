<p class="noindent">[continued from T 5] Then <span class="sc">Brutus</span> said: “On the one hand I recognize indeed the nature of what you [Cicero] say; on the other hand I have always thought Hortensius a great orator, and I admired him particularly speaking on behalf of Messalla while you were away [as governor in Cilicia].” “So they say,” I [<span class="sc">Cicero</span>] said, “and the written speech, reproduced, as they maintain, exactly with the words as spoken, confirms this....”</p>

<p class="noindent">And Q. Hortensius, who in his day was an ornament of Roman eloquence, was admirable in his patience toward his son: for to such an extent did he regard the latter’s undutiful behavior as suspicious and his worthlessness as offensive that he intended to make his sister’s son, Messalla, his heir; in defending him, accused of bribery in the election campaign, he told the judges that, if they condemned that man, nothing would be left for him [Hortensius] except the kisses of his grandchildren, in which he found comfort. With that sentiment, which he also included in the published speech, he placed his son among his mind’s afflictions rather than its delights. Nonetheless, so as not to confuse nature’s order, he left not his grandsons, but his son as his heir, controlling his feelings with discretion, in that he both in his lifetime bore true testimony to his [the son’s] character and in death rendered due respect to the claims of blood.</p>
