<p class="noindent">Aelius [L. Aelius Stilo Praeconinus (<span class="bold">74</span>)] had two <span class="italic">cognomina</span>: for he was called both Praeconinus, since his father had done the job of a public announcer [<span class="italic">praeconium</span>], and Stilo, since he was in the habit of writing orations for the most noble men in particular [<span class="italic">stilus</span> = “pen”]; he was such a supporter of the <span class="italic">optimates</span> that he accompanied Metellus Numidicus into exile.</p>
