with the utmost credit thirty days previously [on August 1, 44 BC]—declared enmity to me; he ordered me to be present in the Senate on the thirteenth day before the Kalends of October [September 19, 44 BC]. Meanwhile he spent seventeen days [September 2–19] constantly declaiming about me on Scipio’s estate at Tibur, working up a thirst; for this tends to be his reason for declaiming. [20] When the day on which he had ordered me to be present had arrived, then he entered the Temple of Concord with his bodyguard in proper battle array and vomited from his utterly foul mouth a speech against me in my absence.</p>

<p class="noindent">You [Antony], injured not even by a word, have assailed me unprovoked with abuse, as though you wished to look more reckless than Catiline [L. Sergius Catilina (<span class="bold">112</span>)] and madder than Clodius [P.

[5] But [you say] I availed myself of a kindness from you.... [7] ... Then there is the letter he said I wrote to him: in his ignorance of civilized conduct and the usages of society, he even read it aloud.... [11]
