<p class="noindent">For as for P. Clodius, a friend of mine, although he threw himself into most impressive attitudes with the greatest energy and went through everything full of fire with the sternest language and a very loud voice, while I thought well of his eloquence, still, I did not become very scared; for in several suits I had seen him unsuccessful as a litigant.</p>

<p><span class="italic">The ancients praise Calvus as a great orator; he was particularly noted for his energetic delivery, his learning, and a carefully composed and Attic style, limited only by too much self-criticism (T 1–7, 10–11, 13; cf. </span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">158</span></span><span class="italic"> T 7). Cicero, focusing on Calvus’ Attic style, regards his oratory as not too effective with the public (T 1–2), while Seneca, describing the passionate delivery, highlights its impact (T3). Calvus’ oratory, like that of his contemporaries, seemed old-fashioned to some in Tacitus’ time (T9).</span></p>
