<p class="noindent">This [i.e., etymology] is sometimes necessary to use, whenever the matter that is being dealt with needs explanation, as when M. Caelius seeks to prove that he is a <span class="italic">homo frugi</span> [“an honest, frugal man”],<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL542_293_1" id="target_note_LCL542_293_1"><sup>1</sup></a> not because he is abstemious (for he could not put that forward even as a false statement), but because he is useful to many, that is <span class="italic">fructuosus</span> [“fruitful”], whence <span class="italic">frugalitas</span> [“sober habits, self-restraint”] has been derived.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL542_293_2" id="target_note_LCL542_293_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">On T. Annius Milo to the People (F 29–30)</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">As Tribune of the People in 52 BC, Caelius spoke (</span>CCMR<span class="italic">, App. A: 329) to the People in support of T.

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 30</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Pro Milone</span></p>
<p class="noindent">You have seen the Roman People massacred, a public meeting broken up by swords, though M. Caelius was heard in silence, a Tribune of the People, a most resolute man on behalf of the Republic, a staunch upholder of any cause taken on, a devoted champion of the aims of the loyal men and the authority of the Senate, and, in Milo’s present situation, be it caused by hatred or by bad fortune, a man of unique, superhuman, and unbelievable loyalty.</p>
