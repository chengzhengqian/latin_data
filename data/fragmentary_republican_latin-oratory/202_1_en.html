that famous case, when I had to retain Mâ€™. Aquillius as a member of the community. [195] For when I saw a man, whom I remembered having been consul, general, honored by the Senate, and mounting in an ovation up to the Capitol, now cast down, crippled, sorrowing, brought to the greatest crisis, I did not try to arouse compassion in others before I myself was overcome by compassion. I certainly felt that the judges were deeply moved when I called forward the unhappy old man in his garb of woe and when I did those things that you, Crassus, praise, not by way of an art, about which I do not know what to say, but out of a great movement of passion and distress, namely that I tore open his tunic to expose his scars. [196] When C. Marius, present and sitting in court, was strongly reinforcing, by his tears, the pathos of my speech, and I, repeatedly naming him, was committing his colleague to his care and calling upon him to speak himself in support of the common interests of generals, this lamentation, as well as the invocation of all gods and men, citizens and allies, was not without my tears, not without enormous distress. Had my distress been missing from all the words that I uttered on that occasion, my speech would not only not have inspired compassion, but would even have deserved ridicule. That is why I am telling you this, Sulpicius [P. Sulpicius Rufus (<span class="bold">76</span>)], the decent and accomplished teacher, obviously, that I am, so that you all can be wrathful, be indignant, and be tearful when speaking.</p>
