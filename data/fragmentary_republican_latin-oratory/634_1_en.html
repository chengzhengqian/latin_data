<p class="noindent">But an allegory that is rather obscure is called “<span class="italic">aenigma</span>” [“riddle”], a fault, at least in my opinion, if speaking lucidly is a virtue; still, both the poets use it [Verg. <span class="italic">Ecl. </span>3.104–5]: “Say in what land, and you will be the great Apollo to me, the space of heaven is not more than three cubits broad?”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL542_291_1" id="target_note_LCL542_291_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and sometimes the orators, like Caelius: “quarter-dollar Clytemnestra” and “Coa at dinner, Nola in the bedroom.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL542_291_2" id="target_note_LCL542_291_2"><sup>2</sup></a> To be sure, they are being solved even now and were then better known when they were uttered: still, they are “<span class="italic">aenigmata</span>” ...</p>

Metellus Celer. According to Plutarch (Plut. <span class="italic">Cic.</span> 29.5), Clodia was called <span class="italic">Quadrantia</span> since one of her lovers had sent her copper coins as if they were silver, and the smallest copper coin was called <span class="italic">quadrans</span>; Cicero alludes to the story thatClodia admitted lovers for a <span class="italic">quadrans</span> (Cic. <span class="italic">Cael.</span> 62). The “names” Coa and Nola are attested as designations for a female inhabitant of the Greek island of Kos and of a town in southern Italy, respectively. Here they are probably fictitious and may be intended to invoke associations of the fine and transparent Coan garments (e.g., Tib. 2.3.57–58; Prop.1.2.2) and a refusal (<span class="italic">nolo</span>).
