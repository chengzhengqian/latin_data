<p><span class="italic">Curio wrote a dialogue including an invective against Caesar (Cic. </span>Brut.<span class="italic"> 218; cf. </span>FRHist<span class="italic"> A 35), and seems to have discussed geographical matters, since Pliny the Elder lists him among the sources for his Book 3 (Plin. </span>HN<span class="italic"> 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">In Cicero, Curio is mentioned as a respectable orator in the first half of the first century BC (T 1). It is noted that he had little education in literature, history, and law, but spoke a polished and educated Latin, such as he might have learned at home; his memory and delivery are described as ridiculous and his arrangement as disorderly, but his speeches were regarded as worth reading because of their language and style (T 2; Cic. </span>De or.<span class="italic"> 2.98).</span></p>
