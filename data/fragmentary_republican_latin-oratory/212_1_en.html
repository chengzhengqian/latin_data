<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Antonius</span>:] And so, convinced by this very view [i.e., that nobody could be an eloquent orator who did not know about discussions among eminent philosophers; cf. Cic. <span class="italic">De or.</span> 2.93], I actually wrote down in some little treatise, which got about without my knowledge or consent and got into the hands of the public, that statement that I had known several accomplished speakers, but so far no one eloquent, since I judged anyone to be an accomplished speaker who was able to speak sufficiently to the point and clearly before an everyday audience and in line with some standard view of men, but that man to be eloquent who was able, in a style more admirable and more splendid, to amplify and adorn any subject he chose, and who encompassed in his mind and memory all the sources of all matters that are relevant to speaking.</p>
