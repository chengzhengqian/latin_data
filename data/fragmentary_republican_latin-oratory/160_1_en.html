<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Scaevola</span>:] What? As regards those rules of civil law that have long made their home in our family without any reputation for eloquence, were they ever invented or investigated or dealt with in any way by the tribe of orators?</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Crassus</span>:] For the house of a jurist is undoubtedly an oracle of the whole community. Evidence for this is the gateway and the forecourt of our friend here, Q. Mucius, since, notwithstanding his very poor health and already advanced age, they are thronged daily by a great crowd of citizens and the splendor of most distinguished men.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Antonius</span>:] Now our friend Crassus [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>)] seemed to me to mark out the scope of the orator, not by the bounds of that art, but by the almost infinite extent of his own talent. For by his verdict he even handed over to the orator the helm of running the community; and in that it seemed most amazing to me, Scaevola, that you should grant him this point, since the Senate has very often agreed with you on very important matters, when you spoke briefly and without ornament.</p>
