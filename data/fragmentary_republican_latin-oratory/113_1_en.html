“proved the son’s rashness.” There will not be any effect, although <span class="italic">temeritas</span> [“rashness”] consists of three shorts and a long [syllable], the foot [paeon] that Aristotle [cf. Cic. <span class="italic">Orat.</span> 192–93; <span class="italic">De or. </span>3.182–83] regards as the best (with whom I disagree).</p>

<p class="noindent">And indeed Livius himself, in his public speeches, always said that he drafted these [bills on settlement, opposed to C. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">48</span>)] as approved by the Senate, being concerned for the common people. And this in fact was the only advantage that resulted from his political measures.</p>

<p class="noindent">And when Rubrius [C.(?) Rubrius, tr. pl. 122 BC], one of his colleagues, had brought in a bill for the founding of a colony in Carthage, which had been destroyed by Scipio [P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus minor (<span class="bold">21</span>)], Gaius [C. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">48</span>)], selected by lot, sailed off to Africa for the foundation. In his [Gaius’] absence, Drusus assaulted him even more, made the People defect [from Gaius], and attached them to himself, particularly through his slanders against Fulvius [M. Fulvius Flaccus (<span class="bold">40</span>)].</p>

<p class="noindent">...hence the followers of Drusus found fault with him [C. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">48</span>)] because he bought silver dolphins at a price of twelve hundred and fifty drachmas for each pound.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_227_1" id="target_note_LCL540_227_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
