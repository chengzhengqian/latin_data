<p class="noindent">...whereas of your [Antony’s] wife [Fulvia], the good lady, rich at least, the father is a certain Bambalio [M. Fulvius Bambalio], a person of no consequence. There is nothing more contemptible than that man who got his name from his stammering tongue and dull wits by way of insult. “But the grandfather was a nobleman.” Of course, that Tuditanus [Fulvia’s maternal grandfather], who used to scatter coins from the Rostra among the People, dressed in an actor’s robe and buskins. I would wish that he had passed on to his family his contempt for money! Here you have a noble family to boast of! [17] But how is it that the daughter of a Iulia [Octavian’s mother] seems of humble background to you when you constantly brag of coming from the same family on your mother’s side? What folly, again, this talk about lowborn wives from a man whose father [Antony’s father] had as his wife Numitoria of Fregellae, the daughter of a traitor, and who himself acknowledged children by the daughter [Fadia, Antony’s former partner] of a freedman? ... He further rebukes Q. Cicero, my brother’s son, in an edict and does not perceive that a rebuke coming from him is a commendation.... [18] But this gladiator even dared to write that he [Quintus] had contemplated the murder of his father and his uncle.... And in the same edicts he mentions me, without knowing whether he is praising or attacking me: when he threatens most loyal citizens with the punishment that I inflicted on the worst and the most criminal, he seems to be praising me, as though he wished to imitate me; but when he renews the memory of that most glorious act, then he thinks that he is stirring up some odium against me on the part of persons like himself.</p>
