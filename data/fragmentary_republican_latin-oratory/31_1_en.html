<p class="noindent">L. Cornelius, Gnaeus’ son, the praetor, consulted the Senate on the third day before the Nones of May [May 5] in the Temple of Castor. To write up [the decree] there were A. Manlius, Aulus’ son, Sex. Iulius ...L. Postumius, Spurius’ son. As regards the fact that you, people of Tibur, gave a speech and the matters concerning which you exonerated yourselves, the Senate gave heed to it in such way as was appropriate. And we had heard those things in such a way as you said they had been reported to you. We were not of the view that it had been done thus, for the reason that we knew that you had not been able to do it in line with what we deserve, nor that it would be appropriate for you to do this, nor that this was useful to do for you or your state. And after the Senate has heard your speech, all the more we are of the opinion, just as we thought previously, that with regard to these matters no fault was committed by you. And since you have been cleared of these matters in the eyes of the Senate, we believe that you must be of the opinion that you will have been equally cleared in the eyes of the Roman People.</p>
