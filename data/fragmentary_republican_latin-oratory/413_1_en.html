<p class="noindent">Pompey then very gladly said: “It is not I alone, Romans, who approve this measure, but also all the rest of the Senate, inasmuch as it has voted for land to be given not only to my soldiers but also to those who once fought with Metellus [Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius, cos. 80 BC, who fought with Pompey in the Sertorian War]. [2] On the former occasion (for the treasury had no great means) its granting was naturally postponed; but at present (for it has become exceedingly rich through me) it is right that the promise made to those [soldiers] be fulfilled and that the rest also reap the fruit of the common toils.” [3] After having said this, he went over the details of the measure, and he praised them all, so that the crowd was mightily pleased. Seeing this, Caesar [C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)] therefore asked him if he would willingly assist him against those who were working in opposition, and he also urged the populace to join in asking him for aid for this purpose. [4] When this had happened, Pompey felt elated over the fact that both the consul [Caesar, 59 BC] and the multitude desired his help, although he was holding no position of command, and so, with an added opinion of his own worth and assuming much dignity, he spoke at some length, and he said at the end: “If anyone dares to raise a sword, I alsowill snatch up my shield.” [5] Crassus [M. Licinius Crassus Dives (<span class="bold">102</span>)] too approved of what was thus said by Pompey.</p>
