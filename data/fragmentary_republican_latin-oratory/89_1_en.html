<p class="noindent">From the consequence in an inference, what the Greeks call “from the outcome”: ... and as was said by Gaius Fannius against Gracchus [C. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">48</span>)]: “if you [i.e., the Romans] should give citizen rights to the Latins, I believe, you suppose that you, in such a way as you have assumed your place now, will have a place in the public meeting or participate in games and festive days. Don’t you think that they [the Latins] will seize everything?” For he inferred that they [the Latins] should not be received among the citizenry from what would happen. “I am condemned for having wished to betray the country. What then?

That the second example might be another fragment of Fannius was suggested by Giomini (1978). But the sentence “For ... happen.” sounds like a concluding comment on the passage from Fannius’ speech, and the next example seems to come from the discussion of a different situation. Therefore, it is rather a further example, for which the author is not mentioned.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL540_179_1-1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
