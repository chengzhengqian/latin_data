It attests an additional statement outside court: Calvus, though defending Cato, intervened when Asinius Pollio was attacked by Cato’s supporters.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">[cf. T 3] The same man [Calvus], later, when he saw Asinius Pollio [C. Asinius Pollio (<span class="bold">174</span>), F 15–18] surrounded and beaten up in the Forum by clients of Cato [C. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">136</span>)], a man defended by him [Calvus], ordered himself put up on a pillar—for he was short of stature, whence Catullus too describes him as an “eloquent manikin” in his hendecasyllables [F 21]—and swore that, if Cato had done any injury to Asinius Pollio, his [Cato’s] accuser, he would initiate a justified accusation against him [Cato]. And never after that was Pollio harmed in word or deed by Cato and his supporters.</p>
