<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] When only a young man, he [Crassus] prosecuted C. Carbo, a most eloquent man; he won not only the highest reputation for his talent, but also great admiration.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Antonius</span>:] [Arguments are developed] from consistent elements, from preconditions, and from contradictions, as Crassus once [did] as a young man: “Not just because you defended Opimius [L. Opimius, cos. 121 BC], Carbo [C. Papirius Carbo (<span class="bold">35</span>), F 8–11], for that reason will these men deem you a loyal citizen. It is clear that you were pretending and aiming for something, since in your speeches to the People you frequently lamented the death of Ti. Gracchus [Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">34</span>)], since you were a party to the murder of P. Africanus [P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus minor (<span class="bold">21</span>)], since you brought in that law [cf. <span class="bold">35</span> F 7] during your Tribunate [131 or 130 BC] and since you always disagreed with the loyal men.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_435_1" id="target_note_LCL540_435_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">34</span>) and was involved in the murder of P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus minor (<span class="bold">21</span>), who was critical of Gracchus. A precondition for this attitude is that Carbo always disagreed with the loyal men. Such actions, however, contradict Carbo’s defense of L. Opimius, responsible for killing C. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">48</span>) and many of his supporters.
