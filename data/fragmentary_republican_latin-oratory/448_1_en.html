<p><span class="italic">In Cicero, Caesar is praised for his pure and elegant Latinity and well-chosen vocabulary (T 1–2; cf. T 4, 13). He was regarded as a great and gifted orator, renowned for his style, delivery, and force, and as almost as accomplished in this area as in the field of war (T 2–8, 10–13; Quint. </span>Inst.<span class="italic"> 12.10.11).</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">In addition to numerous routine announcements during his consulships, Caesar is attested as having made various utterances as a politician and general (for speeches in the Senate, see, e.g., Vell. Pat. 2.50.2; in public meetings, see, e.g., Plut. </span>Caes.<span class="italic"> 55.1; Vell. Pat. 2.50.2; Cass. Dio 41.16.1; to soldiers, see, e.g., Cass.

Caesar is also attested as having spoken in support of Cn. Pompeius Magnus (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">111</span></span><span class="italic">) being given extraordinary powers (Plut. </span>Pomp.<span class="italic">25.8; Cass. Dio 36.43.2). He clashed with Q. Lutatius Catulus (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">96</span></span><span class="italic">) on several occasions (Vell.
