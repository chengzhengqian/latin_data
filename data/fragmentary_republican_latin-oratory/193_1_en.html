 Still, he did not speak in a completely impure way, but [he lacked] that distinction that is specifically that of the orator in the use of words.... But, still, in choosing words (and indeed not so much for charm as for weight) and placing them and binding them together in periods, Antonius controlled everything by purpose and by art, as it were; and the same quality was still more noticeable in the embellishment and figurative expression of his sentiments. [141] ... But while in these respects Antonius was great, his delivery was outstanding; if this is to be divided into gesture and voice, his gesture was not expressive of [single] words, but agreed with the course of his thought: hands, shoulders, chest, stamp of the foot, posture, pacing about, and all movement were in harmony with his words and thoughts; [his] voice [was] remaining steady, though of a somewhat hoarse nature. But for him alone this defect turned to an advantage. [142] For in complaints it had something plaintive and well-suited to winning confidence and also to stirring compassion ... [144] For as Antonius possessed incredible skill in creating an inference, in provoking or allaying a suspicion, so in interpretation, in definition, in unfolding the implications of equity nothing was more resourceful than Crassus ... [165] And, indeed, he [Crassus] was also outstanding in the manner of speaking for addressing the People; Antoniusâ€™ manner of speaking was much better suited to the courts than to popular assemblies.</p>
