<p class="noindent">You posit two conspiracies, Torquatus [L. Manlius Torquatus (<span class="bold">146</span>)]: one that is said to have been formed in the consulship of Lepidus and Volcatius [66 BC], when your father [L. Manlius Torquatus (<span class="bold">109</span>)] was consul designate, the other during my consulship [63 BC]. You say that Sulla was involved in both of them.... [12] Who, then, was party to your [the Torquatii] deliberations? All these men whom you see here present in support of him [Sulla] and especially Q. Hortensius; because of his high office, his prestige, and his exceptional devotion to the Republic, as well as particularly because of his very close friendship and very great affection for your father, he was moved by the dangers affecting all and especially by those confronting your father individually. So the charge of that earlier conspiracy has been refuted by a man [Hortensius] who was party to it, who got to know it, who shared both your deliberations and your fear. While his speech in repelling this charge was very detailed and very elaborate, yet there was no less authoritativeness in it than technical skill.... [14] And since you heard Hortensius with attention on the charges relating to the earlier conspiracy, now, concerning the later conspiracy that was formed during my consulship, first listen to this.</p>
