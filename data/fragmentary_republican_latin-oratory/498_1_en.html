Now that third item of the speech remains for me, about the charges of bribery; it has been fully dealt with by those who have spoken before me [the other advocates for the defense]; it must be examined again by me since this is what Murena wished. In this context ... I will reply to M. Cato, a man outstanding in every virtue, on his charge, on the decree of the Senate, on the state of the Republic.... [56] ... A prosecutor is M. Cato, who was never estranged from Murena in any matter, who, moreover, was born in this community for us into such a position that his resources and talent should offer protection to many, even strangers, destruction rarely, even to an enemy.... [58] I come now to M. Cato, who is the root and core of the whole prosecution; he is, indeed, so authoritative and forceful a prosecutor that I fear his prestige far more than his charges. In the case of this prosecutor, judges, I shall first offer this prayer, that his authority, that his expectation of the Tribunate [62 BC], that the luster and dignity of his whole life may not do any harm to L. Murena; secondly, that he may not be the only man to be harmed by those resources that M. Cato has acquired so that he could help many.... [66] ... Can you think of anyone more affable, more sociable, more inclined to every consideration of humanity than Cato, your great-grandfather [M. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">8</span>)]? When you spoke of his outstanding virtue truthfully and seriously, you said that you had an example to imitate in your own family.... [67] ... What accusation do you make, Cato, what allegation do you bring to court, what is your charge? You make an accusation of bribery; I do not defend it. You censure me for defending the very offense that I have punished by my law. I punished bribery, not innocence. I shall certainly prosecute
