<span class="label"><span class="italic">Against Antony’s Insults (F 40)</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The piece against Antony’s insults may not have been a delivered oration, but rather an edited text.</span></p>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 40</span> Charisius</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">catinus</span> [“large bowl”] is used in the masculine gender, as ... and hence <span class="italic">catillus</span> [“small bowl”] comes about as a diminutive, as Asinius [says] against Antony’s insults: “and in the entire city small bowls flit about.”</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Against Valerius (F 41)</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Whether the piece against Valerius, apparently the poet Catullus, is an extensive speech or a grammatical work is unclear (cf. </span>GRF<span class="italic">, F 5, p.499).</span></p>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 41</span> Charisius</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">hos pugillares</span> [“this set of writing tablets”] you should say, both in the masculine gender and always in the plural, as Asinius [does] [in his work] against Valerius, in book one, since a <span class="italic">pugillus</span> [“a handful”] is what includes several tablets sewed in sequence. But still the same Catullus says <span class="italic">haec pugillaria</span> in the neuter gender rather frequently in his hendecasyllables [Catull. 42.5]. Likewise Laberius, in <span class="italic">Piscator</span> [Lab. <span class="italic">Mim. </span>71<sup>1</sup> R.<sup>2–3</sup>], says <span class="italic">hoc pugillar</span> in the singular.</p>
