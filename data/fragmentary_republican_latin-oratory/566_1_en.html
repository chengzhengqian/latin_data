<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] And Epicurus’ views on pleasure were once defended meticulously by L. Torquatus [L. Manlius Torquatus (<span class="bold">146</span>)], a man well versed in all kinds of learning; a reply to him was given by me, while C. Triarius, a particularly serious and learned young man, took part in that discussion. [14] When both of them had come to pay me their respects at my place at Cumae, there were first a few remarks among us about literature, of which both were enthusiastic students. Then Torquatus said: “As we have for once found you at leisure, I am resolved to hear the reason why it is that you regard our Epicurus, not indeed with hatred, as those who disagree with him mostly do, but certainly with disapproval: I myself consider him as the one person who has discerned the truth and who has delivered the minds of men from the gravest errors and imparted to them everything that concerns living well and happily. But I believe that you, like our friend Triarius, are less pleased by him because he has neglected those ornaments of speech found in Plato, Aristotle, and Theophrastus.
