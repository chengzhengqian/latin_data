 of the Roman People? [4] He [Caesar] cites his own patience, since of his own accord he had proposed that the armies be dismissed, a matter in which he would experience the loss of dignity and prestige. [5] He shows the harshness of his enemies, who were refusing for themselves what they asked from the other side and preferred creating total confusion to giving up power and armies. [6] He singles out the injury done in depriving him of his legions, and the brutality and highhandedness in obstructing the Tribunes of the People. He recounts the terms proposed by him, the negotiations requested and refused. [7] For all these reasons he exhorts and asks that they take charge of the state and administer it with him; but if they are shirking their duty out of fear, he will not be a burden to them and will administer the Republic on his own. [8] Envoys, he says, ought to be sent to Pompey about a settlement; he does not fear what Pompey had mentioned in the Senate a little earlier: that authority was granted to those to whom envoys were sent, and the fear of those who sent them was demonstrated. [9] This looked like a sign of a petty and feeble character, but he, just as he had made an effort to get ahead in resources, so he wished to outdo others in justice and equity.</p>
