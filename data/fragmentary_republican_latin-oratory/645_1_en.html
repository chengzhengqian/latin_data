<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] “Yet mention ought to be made, as it seems to me at least, of two young men who, had they lived longer, would have obtained great renown for eloquence.” [280] “You are referring to C. Curio [C. Scribonius Curio (<span class="bold">170</span>)] and C. Licinius Calvus, I guess,” said <span class="sc">Brutus</span>. “...[<span class="bold">170</span> T1] ... [283] But let us return to Calvus—for he had been proposed by us—he was an orator more trained in scholarship than Curio, and in particular he presented a style of speaking more carefully elaborated and more recherché. Although he handled it in a knowledgeable and elegant fashion, yet examining and observing himself too much and fearing lest he might include anything faulty, he alsolost true vitality. Therefore, his language, attenuated through too much scrupulousness, was great for the learned and for careful listeners, but &lt;by&gt; the multitude and by the Forum, for which eloquence is born, it was merely swallowed.” [284] Here <span class="sc">Brutus</span> said: “Our friend Calvus wished to be called an Attic orator; that was the reason for that meagerness of style, which he cultivated deliberately.”</p>

For, first, I sent that letter to Calvus, not thinking that it would get into circulation any more than the one you are reading at this moment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL542_313_1" id="target_note_LCL542_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For we write in one way what we believe only the addressees will read, in another way what many will read. Secondly, I praised his talent more generously
