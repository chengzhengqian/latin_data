past.” “Why, then?” I [<span class="sc">Cicero</span>] said. “Are you waiting for what I think about those men who are as well known to you as to me?” “Well,” he said, “Marcellus is sufficiently known to me, but Caesar too little: for, the former I have heard often; in the time when I was able to form some judgment of my own, the latter was away [from Rome].” [249] “Well, what is your judgment,” &lt;I said&gt;, “about that man whom you have heard often?” “What do you think,” he said, “other than that you will have him similar to yourself?” “Indeed,” I said, “if this is the case, I should wish him to please you as much as possible.” “But it is like that,” he said, “and he pleases me very much, and indeed not without good reason. For he has both studied hard and, omitting all other studies, worked toward this one goal, and by daily exercises he has trained most energetically. [250] As a result of this, he uses carefully chosen words and a wealth &lt;of pointed statements&gt;, and through the brilliance of his voice &lt;and&gt; the dignity of his movements what he says becomes attractive and brilliant; and all this is at his disposal to such an extent that I believe that he lacks no quality belonging to an orator. And he is to be praised most of all because at this very time, as far as possible in this our general and almost fatal misfortune, he consoles himself with the consciousness of his excellent attitude and particularly with the constant attention to and renewed uptake of scholarly pursuits. For I recently saw the man at Mytilene, and, as I have said, I saw a man indeed. Therefore, while before I have seen him comparable to you in speaking, so now, after he had been instructed by a very learned man and a very good friend of yours, as I learned, Cratippus [Peripatetic philosopher, 1st cent. BC], in all resources, I saw him much more comparable.”</p>
