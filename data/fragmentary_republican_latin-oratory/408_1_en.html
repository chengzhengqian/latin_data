<span class="label"><span class="italic">On Tribunician Powers to the People (F 12–14)</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">When consul designate for his first consulship (71 BC), Pompey delivered a speech (</span>CCMR<span class="italic">, App. A: 241) to a public meeting on the restitution of tribunician powers (App. </span>B Civ.<span class="italic"> 1.121.560).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 12</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Verrine Orations</span></p>
<p class="noindent">For no other reason [viz., distrust of courts] have the Roman People requested tribunician power with such eagerness. When they demanded this, they appeared to demand that nominally; in fact, they demanded law courts. And this fact did not escape Q. Catulus [Q. Lutatius Catulus (<span class="bold">96</span>), F 4], that very wise and very eminent individual: when Pompey, that very valiant and very distinguished man, was putting forward a proposal on tribunician power,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL541_313_1" id="target_note_LCL541_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he [Catulus], when he was asked for his opinion, had recourse to this opening with the greatest authority; ... [45] Finally, when Pompey himself, as consul designate [end of 71 BC], for the first time addressed a public meeting near the city [of Rome], where, in accordance with what appeared to be very widely expected, he indicated that he would restore tribunician power, upon that, a murmuring noise of grateful approval arose from the meeting. When, in the same speech to the People, he had said that the provinces had been wasted and laid desolate, that the law courts had become scandalous and wicked, that he intended to take measures and to deal with this matter, then it was with no mere murmur, but with a mighty roar that the Roman People showed their favorable attitude.</p>
