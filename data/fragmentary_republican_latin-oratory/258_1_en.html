<span class="label"><span class="italic">On Behalf of Sex. Naevius (F 14)</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In 81 BC Philippus appeared on behalf of Sex. Naevius, whose advocate was Q. Hortensius Hortalus (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">92</span></span><span class="italic"> F 16–18), while the opponent P. Quinctius was defended by Cicero (Cic. </span>Quinct.<span class="italic"> 77, 80; </span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 126).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 14</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Pro Quinctio</span></p>
<p class="noindent">[Sex. Naevius envisaged to be speaking:] “...for me L. Philippus will fight, a man of the greatest eminence in the community for his eloquence, dignity, and position; Hortensius [Q. Hortensius Hortalus (<span class="bold">92</span>), F 16–18] will speak, a man distinguished for his talent, nobility, and reputation; there will also be men of the highest rank and the greatest power, so that not only P. Quinctius, who is fighting for his life [as the accused], trembles at their numbers and presence, but even anyone who is beyond such danger.”</p>

Claudius Pulcher (cos. 79, interrex 77 BC), the proconsul Q. Lutatius Catulus (cos. 78 BC), and others with military power provide protection for the city and see to it that the Republic suffers no harm.</span></p>
