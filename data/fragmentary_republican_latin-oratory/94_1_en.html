<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Scaevola</span>:] ...of all men to whom I have listened except the two of you [M. Antonius (<span class="bold">65</span>) and L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>)], Crassus, it seems to me that the most eloquent were Ti. and C. Sempronius, whose father [Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">10</span>)], a sagacious and dignified man, but in no way eloquent, was often on other occasions and particularly when censor instrumental for the welfare of the Republic.... But his sons, accomplished speakers and equipped for speaking with all advantages of nature or training, after they had taken over a community flourishing exceedingly because of their father’s counsels or their ancestors’ military achievements, shattered the Republic by that outstanding guide of communities, as you call it, eloquence.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">T 6</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">De Haruspicum Responsis</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Ti. Gracchus shattered the stability of the community, a man of what authority, what eloquence, what standing! So that he had not swerved at all from the eminent and remarkable qualities of his father [Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">10</span>)] and his grandfather Africanus [P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus maior (<span class="bold">4</span>)], except for the fact that he had turned away from the Senate.</p>

<p class="noindent">Being descended from a distinguished family on both sides, in his own right he [Ti. Gracchus] towered above his contemporaries in sagacity, in skill as a speaker, and, in short, in every accomplishment; and he was able to maintain frankness of speech against the preeminence of his opponents.</p>
