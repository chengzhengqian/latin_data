exhibited games at Praeneste [modern Palestrina, near Rome].” ... “That at Cyrene [in Africa] he [Laterensis] was generous to the tax collectors, just to the business partners.” ... [66] ... For those speeches, Cassius, which you tell us it is your custom to read when you are at leisure, I have written during festivals and holidays, so that I would never be entirely at leisure.... [68] For, as to your assertion, Cassius, that I am under no deeper obligation to Plancius than to all loyal men, because to them my wellbeing was equally dear, I admit that I am in debt to all loyal men.... [69] You ask me, Cassius, what I could do for my brother, who is very dear to me, what for my children, compared to whom nothing can be sweeter for me, more than I am doing for Plancius ... You remind us that even Opimius [L. Opimius, cos. 121 BC], that savior of the Republic, was condemned; you mention Calidius [Q. Calidius, tr. pl. 98, praet. 79 BC], too, by whose law [<span class="italic">Lex Calidia de Q. Caecilio Metello revocando</span>: <span class="italic">LPPR</span>, p.334] Q. Metellus [Q. Caecilius Metellus Numidicus (<span class="bold">58</span>)] was restored to civil rights; you blame my intercession on behalf of Plancius, since on his own account Opimius was not acquitted, nor Calidius by that of Metellus.... [71] But I am turning Plancius’ kindness [during Cicero’s exile] into something too great and, as you say, am magnifying it by my words, as though I ought to be grateful according to your decision and not mine. “What is that man’s great service?” he says; “perhaps that he did not strangle you?” On the contrary, that he did not suffer me to be strangled. In this context, Cassius, you even whitewashed my enemies and denied that any plot against my life had been laid by them.</p>
