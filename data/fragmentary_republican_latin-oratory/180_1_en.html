Aurelius Scaurus, a legate of the consul, was captured by the Cimbri after the army had been routed, and when he, called into council by them, deterred them from going over the Alps to aim for Italy, for the reason that he said that the Romans could not be defeated, he was killed by Boiorix, a ferocious young man.</p>
