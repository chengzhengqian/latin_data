our times, but Cicero and Caesar [C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)] and Caelius [M. Caelius Rufus (<span class="bold">162</span>)] and Calvus [C. Licinius Macer Calvus (<span class="bold">165</span>)] and Brutus [M. Iunius Brutus (<span class="bold">158</span>)] and Asinius and Messalla [M.

Claudius Caecus (<span class="bold">1</span>)]. At all events he expressed himself with Pacuvius and Accius as his models, not only in his tragedies, but also in his speeches: so stiff and dry is he.</p>
