<p class="noindent">Therefore, immediately, Cn. Lentulus and L. Gellius [L. Gellius Poplicola (<span class="bold">101</span>), F 4], the consuls [72 BC], moved the following resolution in the Senate to be approved, if it seemed good to the senators, that people should not be prosecuted in the provinces for capital charges in their absence; they gave the Senate a full account of the case of Sthenius [of Thermae, wronged by C. Verres] and the iniquitous cruelty of that man [Verres].</p>
