<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] But Cn. Lentulus won a much higher reputation for eloquence through his delivery than by the amount of ability he had. He was neither very acute, though he seemed to be on the basis of his expression and of his countenance, nor resourceful in language, even though he deceived in that very matter: thus, by pauses, exclamations, a voice agreeable and sonorous, he caused admiration [?] and was fiery in delivery, so that what he lacked was not missed. Thus, as Curio [C. Scribonius Curio (<span class="bold">86</span>)], by some wealth of diction, without any other good quality, held the rank of orator, so Lentulus, by his delivery, in which he was excellent, cloaked his mediocrity in the other virtues of speaking.</p>
