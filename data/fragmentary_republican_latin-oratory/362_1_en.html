<p class="noindent">Hortensia, the daughter of Q. Hortensius [Q.

For reviving her father’s eloquence, she achieved that the greater part of the money requested was remitted for them. Q. Hortensius then lived again in his female progeny and inspired his daughter’s words; if his male descendants had chosen to follow his force, the great heritage of Hortensian eloquence would not have been cut short with a single speech by a woman.</p>
