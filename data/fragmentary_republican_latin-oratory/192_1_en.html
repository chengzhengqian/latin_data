for competition. What is so dissimilar as I [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>)] and Antonius in speaking? While he is such an orator that nothing could be more outstanding than him, I, although I am dissatisfied with myself, am nevertheless especially coupled with him for comparison. Do you see what this style of Antonius is? Bold, vehement, vigorous in delivery, carefully prepared and safeguarded in respect of every aspect of the case, sharp, penetrating, precise, dwelling upon each separate point, making courteous concessions, offering sharp attacks, intimidating, imploring, with a vast variety of styles, never filling our ears to satiety.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] ...so now we come to Antonius and Crassus [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>)]! For I am of the opinion that these men were the greatest orators and that in them for the first time oratorical fullness in speaking Latin was put on a level with the glory of the Greeks. [139] Everything [that was relevant] came to be noticed by Antonius; and each thing was set by him in its own place, where it could be most effective and be most powerful, like cavalry, infantry, and skirmishers by a general, in the most opportune parts of the oration. His memory was outstanding, there was no suggestion of previous rehearsal; he always gave the appearance of coming forward to speak without preparation, but he was so well prepared that, when he spoke, the judges sometimes seemed not sufficiently prepared to maintain their guard. [140] The words themselves, admittedly, were not of the most elegant diction; therefore, he lacked the distinction of speaking painstakingly.
