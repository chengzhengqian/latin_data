come now to that argument of yours: “I did not drive him out; for I did not let him draw near.” I believe you realize yourself, Piso, how much more quibbling and inequitable such a defense is than if you used that one: “they were not armed; they had sticks and stones.” ... [65] And that point seemed to me the most astounding in the whole of your defense, that you said that we ought not to defer to the authority of legal experts.... [66] But in this case of yours, when you are the one who uses a defense based upon the words and the letter [of the law], when this is your position: “Whence were you driven out? From a place which you were prevented from reaching? You were driven away, not driven out,” while this is your speech: “I admit that I collected men together; I admit that I armed them; I admit that I threatened you with death; I admit that I am liable under this praetorian interdict if its intention and fair interpretation prevail; but I find a single word in the interdict where I can find shelter: I have not driven you out of that place that I have prevented you from entering”—in that defense are you accusing those who are being consulted because they believe that account should be taken of equity, not of a word?</p>
