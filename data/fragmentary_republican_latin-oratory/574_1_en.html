<p class="noindent">But, so as to satisfy [the needs of] your age more thoroughly, I have even gone through the records of that entire period; in these I have discovered that on the day before the Kalends of March [Intercal. 27, 52 BC] a decree of the Senate was passed that the assassination of P. Clodius [P. Clodius Pulcher (<span class="bold">137</span>)], and the burning of the Senate house, and the besieging of the house of M. Lepidus [M. Aemilius Lepidus, <span class="italic">interrex</span> 52, cos. 46 BC] were done against the Republic; that nothing further was noted in the records for that day; that on the following day, that is, on the Kalends of March [March 1], &lt;T.&gt; Munatius explained to the People at a public meeting what had been transacted in the Senate on the previous day; at this meeting of the People he said this verbatim: “that Q. Hortensius [Q. Hortensius Hortalus (<span class="bold">92</span>), F 50] had spoken in favor of the matter being investigated by a special court before a quaesitor; that he [Hortensius] believed that it would happen that, after he had given a little bit of sweetness, they [Clodius’ followers] would swallow sharpness in great quantity: against this clever man we used our own cleverness; we found Fufius [presumably Q. Fufius Calenus, cos. 47 BC] to say ‘divide’;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL542_171_1" id="target_note_LCL542_171_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the remaining part of the motion was vetoed by myself and Sallust [C. Sallustius Crispus (<span class="bold">152</span>), tr. pl. 52 BC].”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL542_171_2a" id="target_note_LCL542_171_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> This speech before the People, as I believe, explains what the Senate wanted to decree, and who requested the division, and who vetoed and why.</p>
