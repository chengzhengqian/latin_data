<p class="noindent">That one should not vie with the basest men in abusive language nor have skirmishes of foul words against the shameless and wicked, since you become similar and equal to them for as long as you say identical and similar things to what you hear: this may be perceived no less from a speech by Q. Metellus Numidicus, a wise man, than from the books and teachings of the philosophers. [2] These are the words of Metellus against C. Manlius, a Tribune of the People, by whom he had been assailed and taunted with aggressive words in a speech before the People: [3] “Now, as far as that man is concerned, Romans, since he thinks that he will be a greater man if he keeps calling me his enemy, I, who neither count him as my friend nor take account of him as an enemy, I will not say anything further against him. For I consider him not only wholly unworthy to be well spoken of by good men, but unfit even to be reproached by the upright. For if you should name an insignificant fellow of his kind at a time when you cannot punish him, you would confer more honor upon him than ignominy.”</p>
