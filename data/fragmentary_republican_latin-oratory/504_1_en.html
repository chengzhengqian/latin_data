<p class="noindent">When the day had come for the bill to be put forward [to the meeting of the People] according to the decree of the Senate... But the consul Piso [M. Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus (<span class="bold">104</span>)], the proposer of the bill, also spoke against it. Clodius’ [P. Clodius Pulcher (<span class="bold">137</span>)] roughs had taken possession of the gangways [leading to the voting compartments]; the voting tablets were being distributed in such a way that none saying “aye” were given out. At this point Cato rushes &lt;to&gt; the Rostra, he gives consul Piso a spectacular dressing-down, if a speech full of dignity, full of authority, indeed full of salvation is a dressing-down. Our friend Hortensius [Q. Hortensius Hortalus (<span class="bold">92</span>)] also joined him, many honest men besides; Favonius’ effort [M. Favonius (<span class="bold">166</span>), F 2] in fact was especially notable.</p>
