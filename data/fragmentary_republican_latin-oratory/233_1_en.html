[6] That oration and utterance was the swan song of the divine man, as it were, which we almost expected to hear when we used to come into the Senate house after his death in order to gaze upon that spot in which he had stood for the last time. For while speaking on that occasion, we used to be told, he was seized with a violent pain in the side, followed by profuse perspiration; then, after he had trembled all over, he returned home with a fever and on the seventh day was carried off by pleurisy.</p>

Marius Gratidianus had sold a house to Orata and had not declared in the conditions of sale that a certain part of that building was subject to an easement, we maintained that the vendor must make good any defect in the property sold, if he had known of this and not disclosed it.</p>
