<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In January 49 BC, having just entered the consulship (along with C. Claudius Marcellus, brother of M. Claudius Marcellus [</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">155</span></span><span class="italic">]), Lentulus spoke in the Senate about Cn.

<p class="noindent">The consuls initiate a general debate about the political situation [in response to a letter received from C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)]. L. Lentulus, the consul, promises that he will not fail the Senate and the Republic if they are willing to put forward proposals boldly and forcefully; [3] but if they should look to Caesar and chase after his favor, as they have done on previous occasions, he will make a plan with himself and not comply with the Senate’s authority; he too has a refuge in Caesar’s favor and friendship.... [2.4] All these men [who had made milder proposals], rebuked with abuse from L. Lentulus, the consul, had strong feelings aroused. [5] Lentulus refused outright to ask for a vote on Calidius’ proposal [M. Calidius (<span class="bold">140</span>), F 12A]. Marcellus [M. Claudius Marcellus (<span class="bold">155</span>)], thoroughly alarmed by the derision, abandoned his proposal. [6] Thus, prompted by the consul’s language, fear of the nearby army [of Pompey], and threats from Pompey’s [Cn. Pompeius Magnus (<span class="bold">111</span>)] friends, the majority, forced, unwilling, and coerced, support Scipio’s proposal [Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica (<span class="bold">154</span>), F 3]: that Caesar must dismiss his army by a set date; if he does not do so, he will clearly have acted against the Republic.... [4.1] All these [proposals] are resisted, and they all are opposed
