<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Caesar Strabo</span>:] For, what you give me credit for, Antonius [M. Antonius (<span class="bold">65</span>)], ought, by unanimous verdict, to be yielded to Crassus. For scarcely anyone will be found apart from him who is outstanding in both kinds of humor, both the one that is present all through a continuous discourse and the other that is present in instantaneous puns.</p>

<p class="noindent">Then <span class="sc">Antonius</span> said: “I should certainly have done so [i.e., declare Crassus as most accomplished in using witticisms], were I not sometimes a little envious of Crassus in this respect. For to be as witty and shrewd as you like is not by itself something to be overly envied; but that he who is the most graceful and polished of all should both be and be seen as the most impressive and austere of all, that this was granted to him alone, this seemed hardly bearable to me.”</p>
