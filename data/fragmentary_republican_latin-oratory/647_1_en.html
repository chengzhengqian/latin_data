<p class="noindent">In a similar hurry to death [as Herennius Siculus, the preceding example] was C. Licinius Macer, an ex-praetor, Calvus’ father; when on trial for extortion, he climbed up to a balcony while the votes were being sorted. When he had seen Cicero, who was president of that court [as praetor in 66 BC], taking off his toga praetexta [in preparation of pronouncing the verdict], he sent him someone to say that he had died, not as a man convicted, but as a defendant, and that his property could not be put to public auction. And immediately, he blocked his mouth and throat with a handkerchief that he happened to have in his hand and, having stopped his breathing, anticipated sentence by death. When Cicero learned of this, he pronounced no verdict about him. So an orator of shining talent was saved from lack of property and the reproach of a conviction in his family by his father’s unusual mode of death.</p>

<p class="noindent">I have found some who prefer Calvus to all others; I have found some who believe Cicero [T 1] that he lost true vitality by too much criticism of himself. But his oratory issolemn, serious, controlled, and often also energetic. Moreover, he is an imitator of the Attic writers, and his untimely death did him an injury, if he was on his way to add something to himself, not to take away anything.</p>
