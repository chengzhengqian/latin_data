<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Crassus</span>:] In fact, those who bring their lawsuits to us themselves usually inform us in such a way that you would not want more to be said. But as soon as Fufius or your contemporary Pomponius [Cn. Pomponius (<span class="bold">72B</span>)] has begun to plead the same cases, I do not understand equally well what they are saying, unless I pay close attention; their speech is so muddled up, so confused that there is no first point, no second point, and there is such a flood of unusual words that the speech, which should throw light on the facts, brings darkness and shadows, and that they seem somehow to be shouting themselves down when speaking.</p>
