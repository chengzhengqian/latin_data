<p class="noindent">They [the Romans] were uncertain for a long time, intimidated by the prestige of Pyrrhus and by the calamity that had befallen them, until Appius Claudius, with the nickname Caecus, who had already gone blind by that time, ordered his sons to lead him into the Senate house and said: [5] “I was grieved that I cannot see, now that I can hear. For never did I expect to see or hear deliberations of this kind from you, who, as a result of a single misfortune, immediately have so forgotten yourselves that you wish to take the man who brought it upon you and those who called him hither for friends instead of enemies, and to give the possessions of your ancestors to Lucanians and Bruttians [tribes in southern Italy]. What is this other than Romans becoming servants of Macedonians? And some dare to call this peace instead of servitude.” [6] Voicing many other points similar to these and rousing their spirit, Appius proposed that, if Pyrrhus wanted the friendship of the Romans and alliance, he should withdraw from Italy and send an embassy; as long as he remained, he should be considered neither friend nor ally, neither judge nor arbitrator of the Romans. And the Senate replied to Cineas [Pyrrhus’ envoy] what Appius had said.</p>
