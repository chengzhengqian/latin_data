<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">A little later in November 63 BC, Catiline gave a speech in the Senate in response to Cicero’s </span>First Catilinarian Oration<span class="italic">. The contents of Catiline’s speech can be inferred from the summary given by Sallust.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Finally, in order to conceal his designs or to clear himself, as though he had been provoked by abuse, he came into the Senate. [6] Then M. Tullius [Cicero], the consul [63 BC], whether fearing his presence or roused by indignation, delivered a speech brilliant and of great service to the Republic, which he later circulated in written form [Cic. <span class="italic">Cat. </span>1]. [7] But as soon as he [Cicero] took his seat, Catiline, prepared as he was to conceal everything, with downcast face and suppliant voice, began to beg the senators not to believe rashly anything concerning him: he was sprung from such a family, had so ordered his life from youth up that he had all the best prospects; they should not suppose that he, a patrician, from whom and from whose forefathers there were a great many good services to the commons of Rome, had any need for the overthrow of the Republic, while its savior was M. Tullius, a resident alien in the city of Rome. [8] When he tried to add other insults on top of this, everyone raised an uproar, called him traitor and assassin. [9] Then in a rage he said: “Since I have been cornered and am being driven to desperation by my enemies, I shall put out the fire besetting me with demolition [cf. F 6].”</p>
