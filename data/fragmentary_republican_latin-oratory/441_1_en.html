<p class="noindent">In fact, a remark turned away from the judge [i.e., apostrophe] sometimes makes a point more briefly or proves it more cogently: about this matter I am of the same opinion that I expressed with respect to the prooemium [Quint. <span class="italic">Inst. </span>4<span class="italic">.</span>1<span class="italic">.</span>63<span class="italic">–</span>64], as also with respect to prosopopoeia, which was used, however, not only by Servius Sulpicius on behalf of Aufidia: “Am I to think that you were drowsy with sleep or weighed down by some heavy lethargy?”, but also by M. Tullius [Cicero] in the passage about the ships’ captains (for this too is a narrative of the matter): “to be admitted, you must give so much” and so on [Cic.<span class="italic"> Verr. </span>2<span class="italic">.</span>5<span class="italic">.</span>118].</p>
