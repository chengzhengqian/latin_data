<p class="noindent">[continued from F 5] On the following day, then, in a well-attended Senate, I called upon Catiline to rise and asked him, if he wished, to speak about those matters that had been reported to me. And he, absolutely frank as he always was, did not justify himself, but rather incriminated and entangled himself. For he then said that there were two bodies of the Republic [i.e., Senate and People], one frail with a weak head, the other strong but without a head; and the latter, if it behaved accordingly toward him, would not lack a head while he was alive. The well-attended Senate groaned, but still did not pass a decree sufficiently severe in relation to the vileness of the matter; for some senators were not firm in passing decrees for the reason that they did not fear anything, others because [they feared] everything. He [Catiline] dashed from the Senate triumphant with delight although he should not have left from there alive at all, especially because in this same Senate, a few days previously, he had replied to Cato [M. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">126</span>)], a very courageous man, who was threatening and announcing to bring him to court, that, if any fire was set to his property, he would put it out not with water, but bydestroying everything [cf. F 9; Val. Max. 9.11.3; Flor. 2.12.7].</p>
