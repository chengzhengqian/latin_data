<p class="noindent">For Caesar [C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)], on returning from his praetorship in Hispania [61 BC], wanted to be a candidate for the consulship and at the same time asked for a triumph. [4] But since by law candidates for a magistracy must be present, while those about to celebrate a triumph must remain outside the walls, [5] he asked permission from the Senate through others to stand for the office. While many were willing, Cato opposed it; when he noticed that they were ready to appease Caesar, he consumed the whole day in speaking and thus adjourned the Senate. [6] Accordingly, Caesar gave up his triumph, entered the city, and at once attached himself to Pompey [Cn. Pompeius Magnus (<span class="bold">111</span>), with whom Caesar became allied in 60 BC] and the consulship [for 59 BC].... [continued by F 22]</p>
