prosecutors very insistently demanded a slave for interrogation, since they asserted that he had carried a lantern in front when he [Antonius] went to the defilement. And he [the slave] was still beardless at the time and stood there &lt;among&gt; the spectators, and he realized that the matter pertained to his own torture; yet he did not run away from it. Indeed, as soon as they had got home, he spontaneously urged Antonius, who was rather upset and worried on this account, to hand him over to the judges for torture, affirming that no word would pass his lips whereby the other’s case might be weakened, and he kept faith with his promise with marvelous endurance: for lacerated with very many lashes, put on the rack, burned even with hot plates, he guarded the defendant’s safety and destroyed all the force of the prosecution. Fortune can deservedly be blamed that it enclosed so loyal and so brave a spirit in the body of a slave.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_397_1" id="target_note_LCL540_397_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
