<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Shortly before his death in 91 BC, Crassus delivered an impressive and passionate speech against the behavior and policies of consul L. Marcius Philippus (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">70</span></span><span class="italic">) in the Senate.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 41</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">On the Orator</span></p>
<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] For that genius so deserving of immortality, that humanity, that virtue of L. Crassus was extinguished by a sudden death just ten days after that day that is described in this and the preceding book. [2] For when he had returned to Rome, on the concluding day of the dramatic festival, deeply moved by that speech that was reported to have been delivered at a meeting of the People by Philippus [L. Marcius Philippus (<span class="bold">70</span>)] (who was known to have said that he would have to look for another council, that with the present Senate he was not able to carry on governing), on the morning of the Ides of September [September 13], at the summons of Drusus [M. Livius Drusus (<span class="bold">72</span>)], he and many senators came to the Senate house. There, after Drusus had complained much about Philippus [<span class="bold">72</span> F 7], he [Crassus] raised for discussion in the Senate that very issue, namely that a consul had delivered such a violent attack upon this order at a meeting of the People.
