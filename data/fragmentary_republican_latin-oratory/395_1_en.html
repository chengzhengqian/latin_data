slightly quieter time than Iunius [cf. F 7], but under much the same law and on much the same charge. Because at his trial there was no unrest, violence, or disorder, he was very easily acquitted at the first hearing.... [104] What was Fidiculanius alleged to have done? To have accepted 400,000 sesterces from Cluentius. To what order did he belong? The senatorial. He was accused under the law by which a senator is usually brought to trial in such a case, that regarding the recovery of extorted money, and was very honorably acquitted under that law.... [108] ... But had he [Quinctius] chosen to accuse Fidiculanius during the days in which he accused Iunius, there would not have been the chance for Fidiculanius to make a reply. And indeed he began by threatening all those judges who had voted for Oppianicus’ conviction. [109] ... [112] ... But to return to that point in time at which Fidiculanius was acquitted, what do you [T. Attius Pisaurensis (<span class="bold">145</span>), the prosecutor in 66 BC] imagine to have been proved by theverdict then, you who are so fond of quoting verdicts made? Assuredly, that a verdict was reached without any money. [113] Yet he had voted for conviction; yet he had not listened to the whole case; yet at public meetings he had been assailed by L. Quinctius, a Tribune of the People, furiously and often. Thus, all those activities of Quinctius were decided by the &lt;judges&gt; to be unjust, false, riotous, designed to appeal to the People, and seditious.</p>
