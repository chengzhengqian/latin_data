<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] Whatever qualities M. Piso possessed, he had them as the result of formal learning, and of all who were before him he was most thoroughly versed in Greek doctrines. He possessed by nature a kind of acumen that he had sharpened also by training, that was adroit and skilled in criticizing words, but often ill-tempered, not infrequently frigid, sometimes also witty. The hard labor of the Forum {as if a race course} he did not endure for very long, because he both had a weak body and could not put up with the human ineptitude and stupidity that we [pleaders] have to swallow, and he rejected it rather angrily, whether from a temper naturally morose, as people believed, or from high-minded scorn and disgust. After he had succeeded quite well as a young man, he began to be less well regarded afterward. Then, as a result of the trial of the [Vestal] Virgins, he won great fame, and from that time, as if called back into the race, he held his position as long as he could bear the labor; afterward, as much as he relaxed in effort, so much he lost in renown.</p>
