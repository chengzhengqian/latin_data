as though I ought to be grateful according to your decision and not mine. “What is that man’s great service?” he says; “perhaps that he did not strangle you?” On the contrary, that he did not suffer me to be strangled. In this context, Cassius, you even whitewashed my enemies and denied that any plot against my life had been laid by them. Laterensis asserted the same.... [72] I will now reply to you, Laterensis, using less vehemence, perhaps, than I have been prompted to by you, but, indeed, with no less consideration and no less friendship. For that was, in the first place, somewhat harsh of you to suggest that what I said about Plancius I put forward as lies and inventions of opportunism....
