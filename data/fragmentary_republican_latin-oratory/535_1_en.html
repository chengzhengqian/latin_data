<span class="label"><span class="italic">As Quaestor to the People (F 1–2)</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">As quaestor in 61 BC, Clodius delivered speeches against his political opponents, including Cicero, before the People (Cic. </span>Att.<span class="italic"> 1.16.1; </span>CCMR<span class="italic">, App. A: 279).</span></p>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 1</span> Cicero,<span class="italic"> Letters to Atticus</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Clodius was delivering pitiful public speeches, in which he made abusive attacks on Lucullus [L. Licinius Lucullus (<span class="bold">90</span>)], Hortensius [Q. Hortensius Hortalus (<span class="bold">92</span>)], C. Piso [C. Calpurnius Piso (<span class="bold">108</span>)], and Messalla, the consul [M. Valerius Messalla Niger (<span class="bold">124</span>), cos. 61 BC]; me he merely accused of having fully informed myself.</p>

<p class="noindent">Thus, from then onward, he [Clodius] began to be carried away as a deadly enemy of M. Tullius [Cicero] and, since he was holding the office of quaestor in that year [61 BC], harangued him with very frequent speeches before the People; he declared threats, even alleging that he would make the transition to a plebeian family, so that he could become Tribune of the People.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Altercation with Cicero in the Senate (F 3)</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In his year as quaestor (61 BC) Clodius confronted his opponents, including Cicero, in the Senate. The altercation Cicero reports seems to have been a dialogue rather than a sequence of set speeches.</span></p>
