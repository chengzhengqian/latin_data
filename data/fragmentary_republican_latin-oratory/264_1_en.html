<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] ... M. Drusus, your great-uncle [of M. Iunius Brutus (<span class="bold">158</span>)], an orator of weight, at least when he spoke about political issues ...</p>

<p class="noindent">Then, after an interval of a few years, M. Livius Drusus entered the Tribunate, a very noble, very eloquent, and very upright man; in all his acts he had more talent and good intentions than success.</p>

<p class="noindent">When Livius Drusus, a bold and energetic man, had proposed new laws and Gracchan evils [i.e., measures reminiscent of Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">34</span>) and C. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">48</span>)], surrounded by a huge crowd drawn from all Italy...he is said to have cursed the life of unrest he had had from the beginning and to have said that he was the only person who had never had a holiday, not even as a boy. For, while he was still a ward and wearing the dress of a boy, he had had the courage to commend the accused to the favor of judges and to make his influence felt in the Forum, so powerfully indeed, that it is well known that certain trials were seized by him. [2] ... And so he complained too late that he had never had a holiday, when from boyhood onward he had been a troublemaker and a nuisance in the Forum. It is debated whether he laid hands on himself; for he fell from a sudden wound received in his groin, some doubting whether his death was voluntary, no one whether it was timely.</p>
