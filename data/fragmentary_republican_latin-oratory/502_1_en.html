(<span class="bold">121</span>), F 32–36A], who then spoke in the praetorian position [praet. 62 BC], was so severe, he [Brutus] thinks that those of the ex-consuls were more lenient [cf. Cic. <span class="italic">Phil.</span> 2.12]: those of Catulus [Q. Lutatius Catulus, cos. 78 BC], Servilius [P. Servilius Vatia Isauricus, cos. 79 BC], the Luculli [L. Licinius Lucullus (<span class="bold">90</span>), cos. 74 BC; M. Licinius Lucullus (<span class="bold">91</span>), cos. 73 BC], Curio [C. Scribonius Curio (<span class="bold">86</span>), cos. 76 BC], Torquatus [L. Manlius Torquatus (<span class="bold">109</span>), cos. 65 BC], Lepidus [M’. Aemilius Lepidus, cos. 66 BC], Gellius [L. Gellius Poplicola (<span class="bold">101</span>), cos. 72 BC], Vulcatius [L. Volcatius Tullus, cos. 66 BC], Figulus [C. Marcius Figulus, cos. 64 BC], Cotta [L. Aurelius Cotta, cos. 65 BC], L. Caesar [L. Iulius Caesar, cos. 64 BC], C. Piso [C. Calpurnius Piso (<span class="bold">108</span>), cos. 67 BC], M’. Glabrio [M’. Acilius Glabrio, cos. 67 BC], even Silanus [D. Iunius Silanus] and Murena [L. Licinius Murena], the consuls designate [for 62 BC]. Why then on Cato’s motion? Because it had comprised the same substance in more impressive and ample wording. And this man here [Brutus] praises me for bringing the question before the Senate, not for exposing the plot, for urging them on, finally for passing my own judgment before I asked their opinion. Because Cato had praised all this to the skies and asked for it to be officially recorded, therefore the vote was called on his motion. And this man here [Brutus] thinks he is even giving me a fine tribute because he has written “an excellent consul.”</p>
