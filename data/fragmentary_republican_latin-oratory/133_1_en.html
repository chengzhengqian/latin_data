<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">M. Aurelius</span> to Fronto:] To what extent reading those orations of Gracchus has pleased me is not necessary for me to say, since you know it very well, as you have encouraged me to read these with your very experienced judgment and very kind mind.</p>

<p class="noindent">C. Gracchus is regarded as a powerful and vigorous speaker. No one denies this. But how can this be tolerated that to some he seems to be more austere, more spirited, and more copious than M. Tullius [Cicero]? [2] ... [F 48] ... [4] With respect to such an atrocious matter, such a lamentable and sad manifestation of injustice committed by a public body, is there anything that he said either copiously and brilliantly, or in such a way as to arouse tears and pity, or with abundant and plentiful expression of indignation, and with an impressive and penetrating protest? Brevity there is, to be sure, and grace, and purity of speech, such as is usually found in the gaiety of comedies. [5] ... [6] Now this passage about such a violent and cruel misdeed certainly does not differ in the least from ordinary conversation.</p>

<p class="noindent">“having addressed the gods in prayer beforehand according to ancient custom”: For the ancestors did not open any speech without invoking the divinities, as is the case for all orations of Cato [M. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">8</span>)] and Gracchus; for we read a generic beginning in all of them.</p>
