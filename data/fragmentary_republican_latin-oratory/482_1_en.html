<p><span class="italic">In Cicero, Messalla is described as an orator of not particularly ornate diction, and as a shrewd, cautious, and industrious pleader, diligent in mastering and arranging the material (T 2).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">T 1</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Pro Sexto Roscio Amerino</span></p>
<p class="noindent">As for his [Sex. Roscius’] domestic affairs, they are settled by Caecilia [friend of Roscius’ father]; the conduct of his affairs in the Forum and in court, as you see, judges, has been undertaken by &lt;M.&gt; Messalla.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL541_461_1" id="target_note_LCL541_461_1"><sup>1</sup></a> If that man already had sufficient age and strength, he would plead himself for Sex. Roscius. Since his age and his modesty, which is an ornament to his age, prevent him from speaking, he has entrusted the case to me, whom he knew desired and was under an obligation to undertake it in his interest. Personally, by his constant presence, advice, influence, and unwearied attention, he succeeded in snatching away the life of Sex. Roscius from the hands of the brokers and handing it over to the verdict of the judges.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">T 2</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Brutus</span></p>
<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] M. Messalla, younger in age than us, not deficient in any way, but not very elaborate in diction; a sagacious, shrewd, and certainly not incautious pleader, diligent in mastering and arranging cases, with great industry, great devotion, and engaged in many cases.</p>
