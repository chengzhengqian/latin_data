187 BC], imposed a fine on L. Scipio Asiaticus, brother of P. Scipio Africanus the Elder [P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus maior (<span class="bold">4</span>)], and demanded guarantors from him for that matter. [3] Scipio Africanus appealed to the college of Tribunes in the name of his brother and asked them to defend a man who had been consul and triumphator against the violence of their colleague. [4] ... [6] When, after this decree [of the Tribunes], L. Scipio did not give guarantors, and Augurinus, the Tribune, had ordered him to be arrested and taken to prison, then Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, Tribune of the People [184 BC], the father of Tiberius and C. Gracchus [<span class="bold">34</span> + <span class="bold">48</span>], although he was a bitter personal enemy of P. Scipio Africanus because of numerous disagreements on political questions, publicly swore an oath that he had not won again the friendship and favor of P. Africanus, and thus read a decree from a tablet. [7] The words of that decree are as follows: “Whereas L. Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, celebrating a triumph, cast the leaders of the enemy into prison, it seems contrary to the dignity of the Republic that the Roman People’s commander should be consigned to the same place into which the leaders of the enemy had been thrown by him; therefore I protect L. Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus from the violence of my colleague.”</p>
