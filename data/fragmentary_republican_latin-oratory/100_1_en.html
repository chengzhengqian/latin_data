<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero:</span>] Would that Ti. Gracchus [Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="bold">34</span>)] and Gaius Carbo had possessed such an attitude to running public affairs well as they possessed talent for speaking well: surely none would have surpassed these men in renown....the other [Carbo], as a result of constant fickleness in policies appealing to the People, saved himself by a voluntary death from the severity of the judges. But both were orators of the first rank. [104] And we say this with the recollection of our fathers as evidence; for we have orations of both Carbo and Gracchus not yet sufficiently brilliant in language, but acute and very full of sagacity.... [105] Carbo, for whom life lasted long enough, came to be known by many public trials and civil suits. Those who had heard him were competent men; among them was our friend L. Gellius [L. Gellius Poplicola (<span class="bold">101</span>)], who used to comment that he had been his assistant during the consulship and said that he had been an orator of good voice, fluent, rather sharp, and likewise vehement, very charming, and with much wit; he added that he had been also industrious, painstaking, and in the habit of devoting much attention to declamatory exercises and compositions. [106] He was regarded as the best advocate in that time, and, while he was in control of the Forum, trials began to become more numerous.</p>
