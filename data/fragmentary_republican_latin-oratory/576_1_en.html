<p class="noindent">Calvisius [C. Calvisius Sabinus, cos. 39 BC], a companion of Caesar [C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)], brought forward against Antony [M. Antonius (<span class="bold">159</span>)] also the following charges concerning Cleopatra ... [11]... that while Furnius, who was a man of great worth and the ablest orator among the Romans was speaking, Cleopatra was carried through the Forum in a litter, and Antony, when he saw her, sprang up from the tribunal and abandoned the trial; that, hanging on to the litter, he escorted her on her way.</p>
