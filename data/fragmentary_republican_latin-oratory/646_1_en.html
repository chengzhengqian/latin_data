 than you believe could have happened truthfully; this was first and foremost because I was of that opinion. He was inspired by a keen intellect; he followed a certain style [i.e., Atticism] in which, though he failed in judgment, in which he was generally strong, he still achieved what he had approved; his reading was wide and recondite. There was no force; therefore I was urging him toward that. And in trying to rouse a man and spur him on, it is of the greatest effect if you praise him whom you admonish. You have my opinion of Calvus and my strategy: the strategy that I praised in order to exhort, the opinion that I thought very highly of his talent.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">Calvus</span>, who for a long time waged a most unequal contest with Cicero for the supremacy in oratory, was so violent and passionate a pleader that in the middle of a court speech of his the defendant Vatinius [cf.

Moreover, he used to leave his own benches and, carried by the impulse of the moment, would rush right to his opponents’ side. And his poetry, too, though it is lighthearted, is full of great spirit.... [8] Further, his style in court speeches is vigorous on the model of Demosthenes: there is nothing sedate, nothing gentle about it, everything excited and stormy. [continued by F 32]</p>
