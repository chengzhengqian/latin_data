instance, in my judgment at any rate, being that of L. Crassus and Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus. [2] Crassus was an orator among the first of those at Rome. He owned a splendid mansion, but it was considerably surpassed by another, also on the Palatine Hill, belonging to Q. Catulus, who defeated the Cimbri [Germanic tribe] with C. Marius; but by far the finest [house] in that period was by universal agreement the one on the Viminal Hill belonging to C. Aquillius, a Roman knight, more famous for that property even than for his knowledge of civil law; nevertheless, Crassus was criticized for his [house]. [3] Both men [Crassus and Domitius], from families of the highest distinction, after their consulship, held the censorship together in the 662nd year since the founding of the city; it was filled with quarrels owing to their dissimilarity of character. Then Cn. Domitius, as he was of a hasty temper by nature, moreover inflamed by that hatred that is extremely sour as a result of rivalry, rebuked [Crassus] severely for living on such an expensive scale while censor, repeatedly declaring that he would give six million sesterces for his mansion. [4] And Crassus, as he always had a ready wit, as he was good at clever repartees, replied that he agreed to the deal, with the exception of six trees. When Domitius did not want to buy the place even for a single denarius if these were excluded, Crassus said: “Well then, tell me, pray, Domitius, am I the one who is setting a bad example and deserves a mark of censure from myself, I who live quite unpretentiously in the house that came to me by inheritance, or is it you, who price six trees at six million sesterces?”</p>
