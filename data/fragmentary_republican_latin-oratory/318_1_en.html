<p class="noindent">Afterward P. Clodius was charged with sexual impurity, with L. Lentulus acting as the prosecution [L. Cornelius Lentulus Crus (<span class="bold">157</span>), F 3–4] and C. Curio the father as the defense. For in those times there were three men called Curio with an illustrious name, and they are still referred to in the books thus: Curio the grandfather [<span class="bold">47</span>] ... and this Curio the father, who assisted P. Clodius, and the third, that Curio of tribunician rank [<span class="bold">170</span>].</p>

Pompeius Magnus (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">111</span></span><span class="italic">) had married the daughter of C. Iulius Caesar (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">121</span></span><span class="italic">).</span></p>

<p class="noindent">For there is no doubt that Pompey was taken to task by Curio the father and Curio the son [<span class="bold">170</span> F11] as well as by many others, because, through a desire for power, he had later married the daughter [Iulia] of a man [C. Iulius Caesar (<span class="bold">121</span>)] on whose account he had divorced a wife [Mucia Tertia], after having had three children with her, and whom, with a groan, he had been accustomed to call Aegisthus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL541_133_1" id="target_note_LCL541_133_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
