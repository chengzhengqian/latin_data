<p class="noindent">In this as in other respects, C. Pansa, you have acted outstandingly in that you both urged us to honor Ser. Sulpicius [Ser. Sulpicius Rufus (<span class="bold">118</span>)] and yourself said much at length in his praise.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">In the Senate in Mid-February 43 BC (F 5)</span></span>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 5</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Philippics</span></p>
<p class="noindent">All of us, Pansa, ought to feel and express the greatest gratitude to you; for, although we were not expecting you to hold a meeting of the Senate today, nevertheless, after you had received a letter from Brutus [M. Iunius Brutus (<span class="bold">158</span>)], a most distinguished citizen, you did not let even the slightest of intervals delay our immediate enjoyment of so great a cause for happiness and congratulation. Your action should be welcome to everybody, and particularly the speech that you delivered after the letter had been read. For you proved true something that I have always observed, that a man who is confident of his own worth is never jealous of another’s.... [17] ... In fact, if there were anything that might seem to cause fear of Brutus, would not Pansa see that; or, seeing it, would he not be concerned? Who is either wiser in forecasting the future or more conscientious in warding off a threat? And yet you have seen his attitude toward Brutus and his support. In his speech he told us what we should decree concerning Brutus, what we should feel; and he was so far from thinking Brutus’ army a danger to the Republic that he placed in it the Republic’s strongest and weightiest protection.</p>
