<p class="noindent">...he [Cato] himself expelled from the treasury the chief [of the clerks], whom he found guilty of a breach of trust in the matter of an inheritance, and he brought a second one to trial for fraud. [6] This person Catulus Lutatius [Q. Lutatius Catulus (<span class="bold">96</span>)], the censor [in 65 BC], came forward to support, having great authority because of his office, but the greatest because of his virtue, being thought to surpass all Romans in justice and discretion; he was a eulogist of Cato and was intimate with him on account of his way of life. [7] Accordingly, when he [Catulus] had lost the case on its merits and began to beg openly for the acquittal of the man, Cato tried not to allow him to do this. When he [Catulus] was even more importunate, he [Cato] said: “It would be shameful, Catulus, if you who are censor and should scrutinize our lives were thrown out of court by our bailiffs.” [8] When Cato had uttered these words, Catulus fixed his eyes upon him as if he would make reply, but he said nothing; instead, either from anger or from shame, he went off in silence, much perplexed. However, the man was not convicted, [9] but when the votes for condemnation exceeded those for acquittal by a single vote, and one Marcus Lollius [quaest. 64 BC], a colleague of Cato, missed the trial because of illness, Catulus sent to him, begging him to help the man. And he [Lollius], having been brought in a litter to the trial, cast the vote that won acquittal. [10] Nevertheless, Cato did not employ the clerk, or give him his pay, or in any way take Lollius’ vote into his reckoning.</p>
