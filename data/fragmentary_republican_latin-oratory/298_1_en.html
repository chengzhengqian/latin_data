<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] As for Cotta, then, he was acute in invention, pure and facile in diction; and as he had very wisely learned to relax all exertion in relation to a weakness of the lungs, so he accommodated his style of speaking to his physical weakness. In his oratory there was nothing that was not genuine, nothing not sober and healthy; and that most of all that, since he was scarcely able to move the minds of the judges by the vehemence of the oration and indeed never used that style, he still swayed them by artful management, so that they did the same aroused by him as incited on by Sulpicius [P. Sulpicius Rufus (<span class="bold">76</span>), T2]. [203] ... He [Sulpicius] wished to imitate Crassus [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>)]; Cotta preferred Antonius [M. Antonius (<span class="bold">65</span>)]. But the latter lacked the force of Antonius, the former the charm of Crassus.</p>
