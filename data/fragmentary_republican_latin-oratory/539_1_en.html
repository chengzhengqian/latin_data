<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Also in 54 BC, Clodius spoke on behalf of M. Aemilius Scaurus (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">139</span></span><span class="italic">), who was accused of extortion by P. Valerius Triarius (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">148</span></span><span class="italic"> F 1–2) and defended by several advocates (</span>TLRR <span class="italic">295; cf. </span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">148</span></span><span class="italic">).</span></p>

<span class="label"><span class="italic">On Behalf of Lentulus (F 9A)</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Clodius spoke on behalf of one of the Lentuli (cf. </span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">157</span></span><span class="italic"> F3–4), who had previously prosecuted him in the Bona Dea scandal and was now charged with bribery (</span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 237).</span></p>

<p class="noindent">And Cicero’s action [to defend individuals who had previously acted against him] seemed so deserving of approval that even his greatest enemy, P. Pulcher, did not hesitate to imitate it. Accused on a charge of sexual impurity by three Lentuli, he protected one of them, accused of bribery, with his advocacy and brought himself to act as Lentulus’ friend, looking at the judges and the praetor and the Temple of Vesta, among which that man [Lentulus] had argued the case to the end with a hostile voice, seeking to overwhelm his safety with a foul charge.</p>
