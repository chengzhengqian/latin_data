Accordingly, each of them, as they were called upon for their view in their turn, spoke at length in favor of my case. When Clodius’ turn came, he intended to use up the entire day, and there was no putting a stop to him. But still, after he had spoken for something like three hours, he was finally forced to conclude his speech by annoyed noises from the Senate.</p>
