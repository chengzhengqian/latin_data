<p class="noindent">Were not Scipio [P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus minor (<span class="bold">21</span>)], Laelius, and Cato [M. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">8</span>)] like Attic orators of the Romans as regards their eloquence?</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] [continued from T1] But the speech of Laelius concerning the priestly colleges, however, is not better than any of the many speeches of Scipio [P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus minor (<span class="bold">21</span>)], not that anything could be more pleasing than that speech of Laelius, nor that anything more solemn could be said about religion, yet that man is much more archaic and harsher than Scipio. And, since in speaking there are varying preferences, Laelius seems to me to enjoy more what is ancient and also to use happily slightly more old-fashioned words.</p>
