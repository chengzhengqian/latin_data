But what words did Metellus [the presiding praetor, probably L. Caecilius Metellus, cos. 68 BC] use in making a decision &lt;and&gt; the others that you have called upon? Was not this the language of them all, that, even though what a household was said to have done by men armed and recruited, this could in no way be done rightly, still they would not add anything? ...

[48] ... Therefore, according to those laws that you have read out that man’s household could not kill the slaves of M. Tullius. [49] “Not,” he says, “for that reason have I read these out, but so that you understand this, that such a matter did not seem as scandalous to our ancestors as you think, that a man should be killed.”</p>
