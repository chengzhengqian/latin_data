<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In 76 BC Caesar supported some Greeks when they took C. Antonius Hybrida (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">113</span></span><span class="italic">) to court for appropriating assets and resources (</span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 141).</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But he [Cicero] denied that C. Antonius [C. Antonius Hybrida (<span class="bold">113</span>)] could have a client: for he had robbed many in Greece, after having obtained squadrons of cavalry from Sulla’s [L. Cornelius Sulla] army. Then the Greeks, who had been robbed, took Antonius to court before the praetor M. Lucullus [M. Licinius Lucullus (<span class="bold">91</span>)], who administered justice in cases involving foreigners. &lt;C. Caesar&gt;, then still a very young man, whom we have mentioned a little earlier, pleaded the case on behalf of the Greeks; and when Lucullus had decreed what the Greeks demanded, Antonius appealed to the Tribunes and swore that he rejected upon oath the court for the reason that he could not have a fair application of the law. This Antonius was removed from the Senate by the censors Gellius [L. Gellius Poplicola (<span class="bold">101</span>)] and Lentulus [Cn. Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus (<span class="bold">99</span>)] six years after this was said [censors in 70 BC], and they entered on the roll as explanations that he robbed the allies, that he rejected the judgment of the court, that he, because of the size of his debt, sold his estates and did not have any possessions in his power.</p>
