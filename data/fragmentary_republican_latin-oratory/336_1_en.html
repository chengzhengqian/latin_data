the man as you knew him, Brutus, in his decline, but livelier in the style of diction and delivery. Therefore, I felt that Hortensius rather was the man I had to do with, since in the ardor of speaking I was more like him and nearer in age. For indeed I had noted that in shared cases, such as for M. Canuleius [<span class="bold">80</span> F12] or for Cn. Dolabella, the ex-consul [<span class="bold">80</span> F13–14], though Cotta was called upon as thechief advocate, yet Hortensius [F20, 20A] played the leading role. For a great throng of people and the din of the Forum call for an orator of energy, of fire, of action, and of full voice.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] But since this entire conversation of ours aims not merely to enumerate orators, but to teach some lessons, let me point out briefly what little there is in Hortensius that may be open to criticism or censure. [320] For, after his consulship—because, I believe, he saw that no one from the ex-consuls was comparable with him, and he ignored those who had not been consuls—he relaxed that great eagerness of his by which he had been enflamed from his boyhood; and he wished, in an abundance of allthings, to live with greater enjoyment, as he himself thought, or at least in a more relaxed way. One year, a second, and a third had taken away something, as from the color of an old picture, not so much as any single person from the People, but as a trained and knowledgeable critic would be able to perceive. But continuing further in this way, coming to a standstill in all aspects of eloquence and especially in the swift and smooth flow of language, he seemed to become more unlike himself daily.</p>
