spoken above; for Antonius [M. Antonius (<span class="bold">65</span>)], who was most in demand, was always ready to undertake cases; Crassus [L. Licinius Crassus (<span class="bold">66</span>)] was harder to please, but still undertook them. Those who could get neither of them had recourse usually to Philippus [L. Marcius Philippus (<span class="bold">70</span>)] or to Caesar [C. Iulius Caesar Strabo (<span class="bold">73</span>)]; &lt;more rarely&gt; [?], Cotta and Sulpicius were sought.
