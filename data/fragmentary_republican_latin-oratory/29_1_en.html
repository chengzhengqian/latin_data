 the soldiers to an assembly, by permission of the consul [L. Aemilius Paullus (<span class="bold">12</span>)], and announced: [6] that no one should regard this as a bad omen when in the following night an eclipse of the moon would take place from the second to the fourth hour of the night. Since this occurred in the regular order of nature at fixed times, it could both be known in advance and be foretold. [7] Therefore, just as they were not surprised when they saw the moon shining now with its full circle, now during its wane with a narrow arc, since both the risings and the settings of the sun and the moon were certain, so they should not regard as a prodigy even that it was darkened when it was hidden by the shadow of the earth. [8] In the night that was followed by the day preceding the Nones of September [September 4], when the moon had been eclipsed at the predicted hour, the wisdom of Galus seemed almost divine to the Roman soldiers; [9] [the incident] moved the Macedonians like a dire portent, indicating the downfall of the kingdom and the ruin of the nation, and the soothsayers likewise. There was uproar and wailing in the camp of the Macedonians until the moon emerged back to its usual light.</p>
