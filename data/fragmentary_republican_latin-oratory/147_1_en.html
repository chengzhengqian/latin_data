words: [2] “For, Romans, if you wish to apply wisdom and virtue, even if you inquire into it, you will find that none of us comes forward here without a reward. All of us who deliver speeches are seeking something, and no one appears before you for any purpose except to carry something away. [3] I myself, who am now delivering a speech before you, arguing that you increase taxes, so that you may serve your own advantage and the Republic more easily, do not come here for nothing; but I ask of you, not money, but good reputation and honor. [4] Those who come forward to persuade you not to accept this law, do not seek honor from you, but money from Nicomedes [Nicomedes II, king of Bithynia]; those who advise you to accept it are not seeking good reputation from you either, but from Mithridates [Mithridates V Euergetes, king of Pontus] a reward and an increase of their possessions; those, however, of the same rank and order who are silent, these are even the fiercest, for they are taking money from all and deceiving all. [5] You, since you believe that they are removed from such matters, impart good reputation to them; [6] but the embassies from the kings, since they believe that it is for their sake that they are silent, offer them resources and very large amounts of money, in the same way as in the land of Greece, when a tragic actor regarded it as an honor for himself that he had received an Attic talent<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL540_295_1" id="target_note_LCL540_295_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for a single play, Demades, the most eloquent man of his country, is said to have replied to him: ‘Does it seem wonderful to you that you have gained a talent by speaking? I have received ten talents from the king [of Macedon] for being silent.’ Just so, those men now receive very high rewards because of being silent.”</p>
