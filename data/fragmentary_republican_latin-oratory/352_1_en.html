<p class="noindent">When he [Cicero] was supporting Licinius Murena in a case brought against him by Cato [M. Porcius Cato (<span class="bold">126</span>), F 11–12] and was ambitious to surpass Hortensius, who had made a successful plea, he did not rest for any part of the night before, so that he was harmed by his exceeding concern and lack of sleep and was thought inferior to himself.</p>

<p class="noindent">And that blow [i.e., preparing the prosecution and not focusing entirely on the election] was, as I pointed out, the greatest of all to be struck at your campaign [of Ser. Sulpicius Rufus (<span class="bold">118</span>)], about which a lot has been said by an extremely talented and very eloquent man, &lt;Q.&gt; Hortensius, with great authority. Therefore, an even harder position of speaking has been assigned to me, in the sense that, since both he and a man of immense prestige, diligence, and ability to speak, Crassus [M. Licinius Crassus Dives (<span class="bold">102</span>), F 8–9], have spoken before me, I, in the final position, am not dealing with any one part of the case but am saying about the whole matter what I feel is required. For that reason I am mostly dealing with the same matters and, as far as I can, judges, checking your boredom.</p>
