<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">When Tribune of the People in 52 BC, Sallust, like his colleagues (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">150</span></span><span class="italic"> F 2, 5, 6), delivered speeches before the People (</span>CCMR<span class="italic">, App. A: 331, 335) against T.

<p class="noindent">In the second place—for I do not see why I should not also carry out my business—you know, judges, that there were some who in arguing for this proposal said that the assassination was done by Milo’s hand [T. Annius Milo (<span class="bold">138</span>)], but according to the plan of someone more important. It was myself, obviously, whom these despicable and reckless men described as a highwayman and cutthroat.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">b</span> Asconius on this passage</p>
<p class="noindent">Q. Pompeius Rufus [<span class="bold">153</span>] and Sallust were the Tribunes whom he [Cicero] means. For these were the first to encourage the People over the passing of that law, and they said that Clodius [P. Clodius Pulcher (<span class="bold">137</span>)] was killed by Milo’s [T. Annius Milo (<span class="bold">138</span>)] hand, &lt;and the rest&gt;.</p>
