<p class="noindent">Witness statements against him [C. Cornelius] were made in hostile fashion by leaders of the community, who were very powerful in the Senate: Q. Hortensius, Q. Catulus [Q. Lutatius Catulus (<span class="bold">96</span>), F 8A], Q. Metellus Pius [Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius, cos. 80 BC], M. Lucullus [M. Licinius Lucullus (<span class="bold">91</span>), F 2B], Mam.
