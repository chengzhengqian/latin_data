<p><span class="italic">Staienus was active as a pleader (Cic. </span>Clu.<span class="italic"> 74) and is mentioned as an example of someone influencing trials by corrupt practices, particularly in the court case between A. Cluentius Habitus and Statius Albius Oppianicus (Cic. </span>Clu.<span class="italic"> 69–76; cf. </span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">107</span></span><span class="italic">, </span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">114</span></span><span class="italic">). In 76 BC Staienus took on the case concerning the property of Safinius Atella (</span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 142; Cic. </span>Clu.<span class="italic"> 68, 99).</span></p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] “... and C. Staienus, who had himself adopted and from a Staienus made himself into an Aelius, with a certain intense, insolent, and wild style of speaking; since that was welcomed and approved by many, he would have obtained higher honors if he had not been caught in an evident misdeed and paid the penalty exacted by the laws and the courts. [242]...” [244] Here <span class="sc">Atticus</span> said: “You are drawing from the dregs, and that for some time, but I have kept quiet. In fact, I did not think that you would get down to men like Staienus and Autronius [P. Autronius].”</p>

Earlier, Piso had been accused of misconduct in the campaign for the consulship, but the trial was abandoned owing to bribery (</span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 190). In 63 BC Piso supported the punishment of the Catilinarian conspirators (Cic. </span>Att.<span class="italic"> 12.21.1; </span>Phil.<span class="italic"> 2.12; Plut. </span>Cic.<span class="italic"> 19.1). Piso served as a judge in the trial of the actor Q. Roscius Gallus, when Cicero spoke for the defense (Cic. </span>Q Rosc.<span class="italic">; </span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 166).</span></p>
