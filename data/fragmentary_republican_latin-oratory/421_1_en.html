<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Pompey seems to have intervened on behalf of Manilius Crispus, prosecuted by Cn. Calpurnius Piso, promagistrate in Spain in 65–64 BC (</span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 188).</span></p>

<p class="noindent">When Cn. Piso [Cn. Calpurnius Piso] was prosecuting Manilius Crispus and saw that he, though evidently guilty, was being snatched away by Pompey’s influence, he [Piso], carried away by youthful impetuosity and accusatory zeal, put forward many grave charges against the overpowerful defender. Then asked by him [Pompey] why he did not prosecute him [Pompey] as well, he said: “Give sureties to the Republic that, if you have been challenged, you will not start a civil war, and I will now send judges to consider a capital indictment against you ahead of that against Manilius.” So, in the same trial, he coped with two defendants, Manilius by prosecution, Pompey by unfettered speech; and the former of these he dealt with by law, thelatter by declaration, the only way in which he could do so.</p>
