 even with you a true case of bribery, if you wish. You said that on my proposal a decree of the Senate was passed that it be deemed a contravention of the <span class="italic">Lex Calpurnia</span> [<span class="italic">Lex</span> [<span class="italic">Acilia</span>] <span class="italic">Calpurnia de ambitu</span>, 67 BC: <span class="italic">LPPR</span>, p.374] if men went to meet candidates for payment, if their companions were hired, if places were given tribe by tribe randomly at the gladiatorial games and if likewise dinners were given at random.... [68] ... “Crowds went out to meet him coming back from the province [after Murena’s provincial governorship in Gallia Transalpina in 64 BC].” [alleged point of opponent] That is the normal practice in the case of a consular candidate. And for whom do people not go out to meet them on their return home? “Who formed that large crowd?” ... [70] “But a large crowd accompanied him.” ... “What need is there,” he says, “of this retinue?” ... [72] “But shows were given tribe by tribe and invitations to dinner were given at random.” ... [74] Cato, however, deals sternly with me and like a true Stoic: he says that it is wrong to attract goodwill with food; he says that one ought not to seduce men’s judgment by means of pleasure in an election of magistrates. Thus, if anyone issues an invitation to dinner because of his candidacy, will he be condemned? “Indeed,” he says, “would you seek supreme power, supreme authority, the government of the Republic by pandering to men’s senses, bewitching their minds, and providing pleasures? Were you seeking,” he says, “a job as a pimp from a gang of spoiled youths or world dominion from the Roman People?” A horrible speech; but convention, way of life, customs, the community itself reject it.... [78] But [concern for] the Republic prompted you to prosecute. I believe, Cato, that you have come with such a mind and such an opinion; but you slip up through lack of consideration.</p>
