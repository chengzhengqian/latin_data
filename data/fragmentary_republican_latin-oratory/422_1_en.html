<h2><span class="ac"></span></h2><h2><span class="ac"><span class="bold">112</span> L. SERGIUS CATILINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="italic">Sallust describes Catiline as reasonably eloquent (T 1). Catiline was prosecuted on various occasions (</span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 212, 217, 222, 223, 379).</span></p>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">T 1</span> Sallust, <span class="italic">The War with Catiline</span></p>
<p class="noindent">His mind was reckless, cunning, adaptable, capable of any form of pretense or concealment; covetous of others’ possessions, prodigal of his own; intense in his passions; with adequate eloquence, too little soundness of judgment.</p>
<span class="label"><span class="italic">Against M. Tullius Cicero (F 2–4)</span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">In 64 BC, before and after the elections to the consulship of 63 BC, for which they were both candidates, Catiline delivered orations against Cicero.</span></p>
<p>​</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">F 2</span> Asconius on Cicero, <span class="italic">In Toga Candida</span></p>
<p class="noindent">To this speech of Cicero [<span class="italic">In toga candida</span>] both Catiline and Antonius [C. Antonius Hybrida (<span class="bold">113</span>), F 1A] replied in a manner full of abuse, which was the only thing they were able to do, attacking his status as a newcomer. There are in circulation also speeches published in their name, not written by the men themselves, but by detractors of Cicero: perhaps it would be better to ignore these.</p>
