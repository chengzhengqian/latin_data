<p><span class="italic">As Tribune of the People in 52 BC, Pompeius was involved in the activities that led to the burning of the Senate house. Prosecuted on that account after his Tribunate by M. Caelius Rufus (</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">162</span></span><span class="italic"> F 32), he was found guilty (Cass. Dio 40.55.1; Val. Max. 4.2.7) and went into exile (</span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 328).</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="bold">a</span> Cicero, <span class="italic">Pro Milone</span></p>
<p class="noindent">It was no trouble to ascertain the fixed sacrifices of the Dictator of Lanuvium [Milo’s role]. He [P. Clodius Pulcher (<span class="bold">137</span>)] saw that it would be necessary for Milo to set off for Lanuvium [place in Latium southeast of Rome] on the very day on which he set off: accordingly, he anticipated him. But on what day? On that day, as I mentioned before [Cic. <span class="italic">Mil.</span> 27], on which an extremely frenzied public meeting was roused by a Tribune of the People in his [Clodius’] pay: a day, a meeting, clamor that he would never have left, had he not hastened to a premeditated crime.</p>
