<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] C. Sicinius, then, a grandson of that Q. Pompeius, who was censor [Q. Pompeius (<span class="bold">30</span>), censor 131 BC], by his daughter, died after having been quaestor; an orator deserving of recognition, indeed even already recognized; from that school of Hermagoras [rhetorician from Temnos], meager in embellishment, but handy for invention [cf. <span class="bold">145</span> T 1]. It furnishes precise principles and rules of speaking, which, though they give rather little embellishment—they are in fact barren—still provide order and certain lines that do not permit one to stray in speaking. Keeping close to them and coming to his cases well prepared, not lacking in words, with that equipment and schooling in speaking, he [Sicinius] had already come to be included in the ranks of pleaders.

<p><span class="italic">Varro seems to have appeared as a witness in the trial of C. Verres in 70 BC (Cic. </span>Verr.<span class="italic"> 2.1.71). In 58 BC Varro produced a draft bill on Cicero’s recall from exile for the Tribune of the People T. Fadius (Cic. </span>Att.<span class="italic"> 3.23.4). A charge advanced by Otacilia, Laterensis’ wife, with whom Varro was allegedly having an affair, was dismissed by the presiding magistrate (</span>TLRR<span class="italic"> 391; Val. Max. 8.2.2).</span></p>
