<p class="noindent">Indeed, when at the Senate’s most crowded meetings have there been found four, or at most five, men who did not approve of Milo’s [T. Annius Milo (<span class="bold">138</span>)] case? That is made manifest by those moribund public speeches of this half-burnt Tribune of the People [cf. F4], in which he daily and maliciously inveighed against my power, when he said that the Senate decreed not what it felt, but what I wished.</p>

<p class="noindent">T. Munatius Plancus and Q. Pompeius Rufus [<span class="bold">153</span>], Tribunes of the People [52 BC], about whom we spoke &lt;in&gt; the summary of this speech, as they supported Scipio [Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica (<span class="bold">154</span>), consular candidate in 53 BC] and Hypsaeus [P. Plautius Hypsaeus, consular candidate in 53 BC] against Milo [T. Annius Milo (<span class="bold">138</span>)], delivered speeches at public meetings and ignited the mob against Milo at this very time when, because of Clodius’ [P. Clodius Pulcher (<span class="bold">137</span>)] corpse, the Senate house [Curia Hostilia] was set on fire [52 BC], and they did not stop until they were put to flight from the popular meeting by the flames of that fire. For at that time the Rostra was not in the spot where it is now, but by the <span class="italic">comitium</span>, closely adjoining the Senate house. For this reason he [Cicero] calls T. Munatius “a half-burnt Tribune” [F 3]; and he was well equipped for speaking.</p>
