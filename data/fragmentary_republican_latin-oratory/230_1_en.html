<p class="noindent">After a dispute had started, Cn. Domitius reproached his colleague L. Crassus with having columns of Hymettian marble [from Mount Hymettus near Athens] in the portico of his house. Crassus immediately asked him how much he considered his [Crassus’] house to be worth, and when he replied “six million sesterces,” he [Crassus] said: “Well then, how much less do you think it will be worth if I cut down ten little trees from there?” “Just three million,” [said] Domitius. Then Crassus [said]: “So, which of us is the more extravagant, I who bought ten columns for a hundred thousand sesterces or you who balance the shade of ten small trees with the sum of three million sesterces?”</p>

<p class="noindent">And they tell of the moray eel belonging to Crassus the Roman, which had been adorned with earrings and small necklaces set with jewels, just like some lovely maiden; and when Crassus called it, it would recognize his voice and come swimming up, and whatever he offered it, it would eagerly and promptly take and eat. When it died, then, Crassus, as I hear, even mourned for its life brought to an end and buried it. And on one occasion, when Domitius said to him “You fool, mourning for a dead moray eel,” he [Crassus] took him up, saying: “I mourned for a fish, but you never mourned for the three wives you buried.”</p>
