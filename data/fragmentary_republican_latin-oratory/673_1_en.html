<p class="noindent">[<span class="sc">Cicero</span>:] “Yet mention ought to be made, as it seems to me at least, of two young men who, had they lived longer, would have obtained great renown for eloquence.” [280] “You are referring to C. Curio and C. Licinius Calvus [C. Licinius Macer Calvus (<span class="bold">165</span>), T 1], I guess,” said <span class="sc">Brutus</span>. “You are guessing rightly,” I [<span class="sc">Cicero</span>] said. “Of these the former {which he had said as something plausible} with a free and facile diction gave well rounded form to thoughts, sometimes sufficiently shrewd and at all events abundant, in such a way that nothing could be more embellished, nothing moving more easily. And he, too little trained by teachers, had a remarkable natural gift for eloquence; I have not experienced his industry, but he certainly had eagerness. If he had chosen to listen to me, as he had begun, he would have preferred to seek honors rather than power.”</p>

<p class="noindent">But to the civil war and the large number of evils that then followed for twenty consecutive years no other individual applied a greater and more flaming torch than C. Curio, a Tribune of the People, a man of noble birth, eloquent, reckless, prodigal alike of his own fortune and chastity and those of other people, a worthless man of the utmost cleverness, eloquent to public disadvantage; [4] neither any wealth nor pleasures [?] could satiate his mind, &lt;overwhelmed [?]&gt; by wishes or desires.</p>
