<p><span class="italic">Manlia Sabina. In the Sabine territory.</span></p>
<p>Manlia Sabina, daughter of Lucius.</p>
<p>My parent I loved as being my parent, my husband I cherished in the second place after my parent. Thus was my life’s account proved right—a spotless one. I bid you farewell, stranger. Live your life, death is already on its way for you also.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Papinius Zibax. Rome. Repeated on another stone.</span></p>

<p><span class="italic">A child, Optatus. Found at Rome. Hexameters, elegiacs.</span></p>
<p>. . . Optatus, freedman of Publius and Clodia, lived six years and eight months.</p>
<p>Here my parents burnt my dead body in the flower of my age. So long as was allowed me I lived more acceptable than any other to the gods above, of whom none could speak ill in bitter word . . . to the gods above whom loyalty compels . . . now modestly you . . . say you: ‘Optatus, lightly rest the earth on you.’ . . . a child who had not yet your share of years . . . when I am torn away from my mother’s bosom to death . . . in life I was dear to departed souls, and very dear to the goddess who made away with me under unlucky omens. Cease now, mother mine, cease to torment yourself in vain sobs of wretchedness each livelong day, for grief such as this has not now befallen you alone; sorrows the same as these have fallen to the lot of mighty kings too.</p>
