<p><span class="italic">Gains Atilius Euhodus. On the Appian Way. Tablet of marble.</span></p>
<p>Stranger, stop and “turn<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_29_1" id="target_note_LCL359_29_1"><sup>1</sup></a> your gaze towards this hillock on your left,” which holds the bones of a poor man “of righteousness and mercy and love.” Wayfarer, I ask you to do no harm to this memorial.</p>
<p>Gaius Atilius Euhodus, freedman of Serranus, a pearl-merchant of Holy Way, is buried in this memorial. Wayfarer, good bye.</p>
<p>By last will and testament: it is not permitted to convey into or bury in this memorial any one other than those freedmen to whom I have given and bestowed this right by last will and testament.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Albia Hargula. Rome. Tablet of marble. First century</span> <span class="sc">b.c.</span></p>
<p>Albia Hargula, freedwoman of Albia: lived fifty-six years. Chaste she was and the soul of honour. If the dead below have any sense at all, may her bones which lie here rest in perfect peace.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_29_2a" id="target_note_LCL359_29_2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="italic">Nymphe</span> (<span class="italic">?</span>) <span class="italic">Found at Rome. Elegiacs.</span></p>
<p>If anyone cares to add [his own] grief to ours, here let him be; and with no scanty tears let him deign to weep. Here an unhappy parent has laid to rest his one and only daughter Nymphe<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL359_29_3" id="target_note_LCL359_29_3"><sup>3</sup></a> whom he cherished in the joy of sweet love while the shortened hours of the Fates allowed it. Now she is torn away from her home—earth covers her, dear to her own; now her fair face, her form too, praised as fair,—all is airy shadow and her bones are a little pinch of ashes.</p>
