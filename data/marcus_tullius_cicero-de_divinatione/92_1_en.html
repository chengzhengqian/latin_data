But if at the same instant the liver of one ox is smooth and full and that of another is rough and shrunken, what inference can be drawn from ‘the condition and colour of the entrails’?</p>
<p>“Equally amusing is your story about Pherecydes, who, after looking at some water just drawn from a well, foretold an earthquake.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_405_1" id="target_note_LCL154_405_1"><sup>1</sup></a> It would be presumptuous enough, I think, for natural philosophers to attempt to explain the cause of an earthquake after it had happened; but can they actually tell, from looking at fresh water, that an earthquake is going to happen? Such nonsense is often heard in the schools, but one does not have to believe everything one hears. But grant that these absurdities of Democritus are true—when do we ever consult entrails to learn about crops or health, or when have we acquired information on these partiticulars from a soothsayer after he had made an inspection of entrails? The soothsayers warn us of dangers by fire and flood and sometimes they prophesy the inheritance, sometimes the loss, of money; they discuss the favourable and the unfavourable cleft; they view the head of the liver with the utmost care from every side. If, perchance, the liver’s head should be wanting they regard it as the most unpropitious sign that could have happened.</p>
