His ‘likeness’ or ‘phantom,’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_525_1" id="target_note_LCL154_525_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I suppose—at least that is what Democritus thinks. Whence did the ‘phantom’ come? He would have it that ‘phantoms’ emanate from material bodies and from actual forms. Then, it was the body of Marius from which my ‘phantom’ came? ‘No,’ says Democritus, ‘but from his body that was.’ So that ‘phantom’ of Marius was pursuing me to the plains of Atina? ‘Oh, but the universe is full of “phantoms”; no picture of anything can be formed in the mind except as the result of the impact of “phantoms.”’ Then are these ‘phantoms’ of yours so obedient to our beck and call that they come the instant we summon them? And is this true even of the ‘phantoms’ of things that do not exist? For what is there so unreal and unheard of that we cannot form a mental picture of it? We even shape things which we have never seen—as the sites of towns and the faces of men. Then, by your theory, when I think of the walls of Babylon or of the face of Homer, some ‘phantom’ of what I have in mind ‘strikes upon my brain’! Hence it is possible for us to know everything we wish to know, since there is nothing of which we cannot think. Therefore no ‘phantoms’ from the outside steal in upon our souls in sleep; nor do ‘phantoms’ stream forth at all. In fact I never knew anybody who could say nothing with more ponderous gravity than Democritus.</p>
