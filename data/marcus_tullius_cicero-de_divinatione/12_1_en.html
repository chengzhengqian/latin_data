<p>Then, of a sudden, the moon at her full<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_245_1" id="target_note_LCL154_245_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was blotted from heaven—</p>
<p>Hidden her features resplendent, though night was bejewelled with planets;</p>
<p>Then did that dolorous herald of War, the torch of Apollo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_245_2" id="target_note_LCL154_245_2"><sup>245</sup></a></p>
<p>Mount all aflame to the dome of the sky, to the zenith of heaven,</p>
<p>Seeking a place on the westerly slopes, where the sun has its setting;</p>
<p>Then did a Roman depart from these radiant abodes of the living,</p>
<p>Stricken by terrible lightning from heavens serene and unclouded.</p>
<p>Then through the fruit-laden body of earth ran the shock of an earthquake;</p>
<p>Spectres at night were observed, appalling and changeful of figure,</p>
<p>Giving their warning that war was at hand, and internal commotion;</p>
<p>Over all lands there outpoured, from the frenzied bosoms of prophets,</p>
<p>Dreadful predictions, gloomy forecasts of impending disaster.</p>
<p>And the misfortunes which happened at last and were long in their passing—</p>
<p>These were foretold by the Father of Gods, in earth and in heaven,</p>
<p>Through unmistakable signs that he gave and often repeated.</p>
<p>XII. Now, of those prophecies made when Torquatus and Cotta <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_245_3" id="target_note_LCL154_245_3"><sup>3</sup></a> were consuls,—</p>
<p>Made by a Lydian diviner,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_245_4" id="target_note_LCL154_245_4"><sup>4</sup></a> by one of Etruscan extraction—All, in the round of your crowded twelve months, were brought to fulfilment.</p>
<p>For high-thundering Jove, as he stood on starry Olympus, Hurled forth his blows at the temples and monuments raised in his honour,</p>
<p>And on the Capitol’s site he unloosed the bolts of his lightning.</p>
<p>Then fell the brazen image of Natta, ancient and honoured :</p>
<p>Vanished the tablets of laws long ago divinely enacted;</p>
<p>Wholly destroyed were the statues of gods by the heat of the lightning.</p>
