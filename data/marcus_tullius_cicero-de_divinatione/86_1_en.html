For, if it was the will of Fate that the Roman fleets in the First Punic War should perish—the one by shipwreck and the other at the hands of the Carthaginians—they would have perished just the same even if the sacred chickens had made a <span class="italic">tripudium solistimum</span> in the consulship of Lucius Junius and Publius Claudius!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_393_1" id="target_note_LCL154_393_1"><sup>1</sup></a> On the other hand, if obedience to the auspices would have prevented the destruction of the fleets, then they did not perish in accordance with Fate.

<p>“Again, if it was the will of Fate that the Roman army should perish at Lake Trasimenus in the Second Punic War, could that result have been avoided if the consul Flaminius had obeyed the signs and the auspices which forbade his joining battle?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_393_2" id="target_note_LCL154_393_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Assuredly not. Therefore, either the army did not perish by the will of Fate, or, if it did (and you are certainly bound as a Stoic to say that it did), the same result would have happened even if the auspices had been obeyed; for the decrees of Fate are unchangeable. Then what becomes of that vaunted divination of you Stoics? For if all things happen by Fate, it does us no good to be warned to be on our guard, since that which is to happen, will happen regardless of what we do. But if that which is to be can be turned aside, there is no such thing as Fate; so, too, there is no such thing as divination—since divination deals with things that are going to happen. But nothing is ‘certain to happen’ which there is some means of dealing with<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_393_3" id="target_note_LCL154_393_3"><sup>3</sup></a> so as to prevent its happening.</p>
