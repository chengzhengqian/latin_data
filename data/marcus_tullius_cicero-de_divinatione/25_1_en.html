<p>“May I not recall to your memory some stories to be found in the works of Roman and of Greek poets? For example, the following dream of the Vestal Virgin<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_271_1" id="target_note_LCL154_271_1"><sup>271</sup></a> is from Ennius :
<q>
<span class="line">The vestal from her sleep in fright awoke</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And to the startled maid, whose trembling hands</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A lamp did bear, thus spoke in tearful tones :</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">‘O daughter of Eurydice, thou whom</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Our father loved, from my whole frame departs</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The vital force. For in my dreams I saw</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A man <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_271_2" id="target_note_LCL154_271_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of beauteous form, who bore me off</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Through willows sweet, along the fountain’s brink,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To places strange. And then, my sister dear,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Alone, with halting step and longing heart,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">I seemed to wander, seeking thee in vain;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">There was no path to make my footing sure.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And then I thought my father spoke these words :</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">“Great sorrows, daughter, thou must first endure</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Until thy fortune from the Tiber rise.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">When this was said he suddenly withdrew;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Nor did his cherished vision come again,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Though oft I raised my hand to heaven’s dome</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And called aloud in tearful, pleading voice.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then sleep departing left me sick at heart.’</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>XXI. “This dream, I admit, is the fiction of a poet’s brain, yet it is not contrary to our experience with real dreams. It may well be that the following story of the dream which greatly disturbed Priam’s peace of mind is fiction too : <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_271_3" id="target_note_LCL154_271_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">When mother Hecuba was great with child,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">She dreamed that she brought forth a flaming torch.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Alarmed at this, with sighing cares possessed,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The king and father, Priam, to the gods</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Did make a sacrifice of bleating lambs.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He, seeking peace and answer to the dream,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
