if a Latin equivalent were needed, could be represented by the word <span class="italic">acervalis</span>, but none is needed; for, just as the word ‘philosophy’ and many other words are of Greek origin and are in general use as Latin words, so it is with <span class="italic">sorites)</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_383_1" id="target_note_LCL154_383_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—in both these cases the logician, and not the diviner, would speak.</p>
<p>“Assume, next, that the inquiry is as to the best form of government, or as to what laws or what customs are beneficial and what are harmful, will you call soothsayers out of Etruria to settle the question, or will you accept the decision of men of eminence chosen for their knowledge of statecraft? But if there is no place for divination in things perceived by the senses, or in those included among the arts, or in those discussed by philosophers, or in those which have to do with government, I see absolutely no need for it anywhere. For either it ought to be of use in every case, or, at least, some department in which it may be employed should be found. But divination is not of use in every case, as my reasoning has shown; nor can any field or subject matter be found over which it may exercise control.</p>
<p>V. Therefore I am inclined to think that there is no such thing as divination. There is a much-quoted Greek verse to this effect:
<q>
<span class="line">The best diviner I maintain to be</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The man who guesses or conjectures best.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_383_2" id="target_note_LCL154_383_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</q>
Now do you think that a prophet will ‘conjecture’ better whether a storm is at hand than a pilot? or that he will by ‘conjecture’ make a more accurate diagnosis than a physician, or conduct a war with more skill than a general?</p>
