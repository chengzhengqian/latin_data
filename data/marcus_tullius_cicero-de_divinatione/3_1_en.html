<p>And since they thought that the human mind, when in an irrational and unconscious state, and moving by its own free and untrammelled impulse, was inspired in two ways, the one by frenzy and the other by dreams, and since they believed that the divination of frenzy was contained chiefly in the Sibylline verses, they decreed that ten <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_227_3" id="target_note_LCL154_227_3"><sup>3</sup></a> men should be chosen from the State to interpret those verses. In this same category also were the frenzied prophecies of soothsayers and seers, which our ancestors frequently thought worthy of belief—like the prophecies of Cornelius Culleolus, during the Octavian War.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_227_4" id="target_note_LCL154_227_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Nor, indeed, were the more significant dreams, if they seemed to concern the administration of public affairs, disregarded by our Supreme Council. Why, even within my own memory, Lucius Julius, who was consul with Publius Rutilius, by a vote of the Senate rebuilt the temple of Juno, the Saviour,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_227_5" id="target_note_LCL154_227_5"><sup>5</sup></a> in accordance with a dream of Caecilia, daughter of Balearicus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_227_6" id="target_note_LCL154_227_6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>III. Now my opinion is that, in sanctioning such usages, the ancients were influenced more by actual results than convinced by reason.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_227_7" id="target_note_LCL154_227_7"><sup>7</sup></a> However certain very subtle arguments to prove the trustworthiness of divination have been gathered by philosophers.
