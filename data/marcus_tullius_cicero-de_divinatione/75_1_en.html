<h2><span class="ac">Book II</span></h2>
<p>I. <span class="sc">After</span> serious and long continued reflection as to how I might do good to as many people as possible and thereby prevent any interruption of my service to the State, no better plan occurred to me than to conduct my fellow-citizens in the ways of the noblest learningâ€”and this, I believe, I have already accomplished through my numerous books. For example, in my work entitled <span class="italic">Hortensius</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_371_1" id="target_note_LCL154_371_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I appealed as earnestly as I could for the study of philosophy. And in my <span class="italic">Academics</span>, in four volumes, I set forth the philosophic system which I thought least arrogant, and at the same time most consistent and refined. And, since the foundation of philosophy rests on the distinction between good and evil, I exhaustively treated that subject in five volumes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_371_2" id="target_note_LCL154_371_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and in such a way that the conflicting views of the different philosophers might be known. Next, and in the same number of volumes, came the <span class="italic">Tusculan Disputations</span>, which made plain the means most essential to a happy life. For the first volume treats of indifference to death, the second of enduring pain, the third of the alleviation of sorrow, the fourth of other spiritual disturbances; and the fifth embraces a topic which sheds the brightest light on the entire field of philosophy since it teaches that virtue is sufficient of itself for the attainment of happiness.</p>
