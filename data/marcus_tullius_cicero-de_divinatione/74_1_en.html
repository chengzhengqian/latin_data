<p>LVIII. “I will assert, however, in conclusion, that I do not recognize fortune-tellers, or those who prophesy for money, or necromancers, or mediums, whom your friend Appius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_369_1" id="target_note_LCL154_369_1"><sup>1</sup></a> makes it a practice to consult.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">In fine, I say, I do not care a fig</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">For Marsian augurs, village mountebanks,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Astrologers who haunt the circus grounds,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or Isis-seers, or dream interpreters :</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">—for they are not diviners either by knowledge or skill,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_369_2" id="target_note_LCL154_369_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">But superstitious bards, soothsaying quacks,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Averse to work, or mad, or ruled by want,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Directing others how to go, and yet</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What road to take they do not know themselves;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">From those to whom they promise wealth they beg</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A coin. From what they promised let them take</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Their coin as toll and pass the balance on.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Such are the words of Ennius who only a few lines further back<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_369_3" id="target_note_LCL154_369_3"><sup>3</sup></a> expresses the view that there are gods and yet says that the gods do not care what human beings do. But for my part, believing as I do that the gods do care for man, and that they advise and often forewarn him, I approve of divination which is not trivial and is free from falsehood and trickery.”</p>
<p>When Quintus had finished I remarked, “My dear Quintus, you have come admirably well prepared.”</p>
