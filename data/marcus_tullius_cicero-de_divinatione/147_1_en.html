<p>LXII. “And further, would anybody dare to say that all dreams are true? ‘Some dreams are true,’ says Ennius, ‘but not necessarily all.’ Pray how do you distinguish between the two? What mark have the false and what the true? And if God sends the true, whence come the false? Surely if God sends the false ones too what is more untrustworthy than God? Besides what is more stupid than to excite the souls of mortals with false and lying visions?
