<p class="noindent">But, pray, by what principle of augury does he deduce years rather than months or days from the number of sparrows? Again, why does he base his prophecy on little sparrows which are not abnormal sights and ignore the alleged fact—which is impossible—that the dragon was turned to stone? Finally, what is there about a sparrow to suggest ‘years’?
