<p>“I have just finished a careful reading of the third book of your treatise, <span class="italic">On the Nature of the Gods</span>, containing Cotta’s discussion, which, though it has shaken my views of religion, has not overthrown them entirely.”</p>
<p>“Very good,” said I; “for Cotta’s argument is intended rather to refute the arguments of the Stoics than to destroy man’s faith in religion.”</p>
<p>Quintus then replied : “Cotta <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_233_1" id="target_note_LCL154_233_1"><sup>1</sup></a> says the very same thing, and says it repeatedly, in order, as I think, not to appear to violate the commonly accepted canons of belief; yet it seems to me that, in his zeal to confute the Stoics, he utterly demolishes the gods.

Now let us see, if you will, what efficacy it has and what its nature is. My own opinion is that, if the kinds of divination which we have inherited from our forefathers and now practise are trustworthy, then there are gods and, conversely, if there are gods then there are men who have the power of divination.”</p>
