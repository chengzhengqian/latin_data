<p>XXXI. “It is clear that, in our ordinary speech, we should not have made such frequent use of the word <span class="italic">praesagire</span>, meaning ‘to sense in advance, or to presage,’ if the power of presaging had been wholly non-existent. An illustration of its use is seen in the following well-known line from Plautus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_297_1" id="target_note_LCL154_297_1"><sup>1</sup></a> :</p>
<p>My soul presaged as I left home that my leaving was in vain.</p>
<p>Now <span class="italic">sagire</span> means ‘to have a keen perception.’ Accordingly certain old women are called <span class="italic">sagae</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_297_2" id="target_note_LCL154_297_2"><sup>2</sup></a> because they are assumed to know a great deal, and dogs are said to be ‘sagacious.’ And so one who has knowledge of a thing before it happens is said to ‘presage,’ that is, to perceive the future in advance.</p>
<p>“Therefore the human soul has an inherent power of presaging or of foreknowing infused into it from without, and made a part of it by the will of God. If that power is abnormally developed, it is called ‘frenzy’ or ‘inspiration,’ which occurs when the soul withdraws itself from the body and is violently stimulated by a divine impulse, as in the following instance, where Hecuba says to Cassandra<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_297_3" id="target_note_LCL154_297_3"><sup>3</sup></a>:
<q>
<span class="line">But why those flaming eyes, that sudden rage?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And whither fled that sober modesty,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Till now so maidenly and yet so wise?’</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</q>
and Cassandra answers :
<q>
<span class="line">O mother, noblest of thy noble sex!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">I have been sent to utter prophecies :</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Against my will Apollo drives me mad</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To revelation make of future ills.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">O virgins! comrades of my youthful hours,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">My mission shames my father, best of men.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
