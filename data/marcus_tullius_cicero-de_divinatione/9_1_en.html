<p>Blue-grey herons,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_239_1" id="target_note_LCL154_239_1"><sup>1</sup></a> in fleeing the raging abyss of the ocean, Utter their warnings, discordant and wild, from tremulous gullets,</p>
<p>Shrilly proclaiming that storms are impending and laden with terrors.</p>
<p>Often at dawn, when Aurora releases the frost in the dewdrops,</p>
<p>Does the nightingale <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_239_2" id="target_note_LCL154_239_2"><sup>2</sup></a> pour from its breast predictions of evil;</p>
<p>Then does it threaten and hurl from its throat its incessant complaining.</p>
<p>Often the dark-hued crow, while restlessly roaming the seashore,</p>
<p>Plunges its crest in the flood, as its neck encounters the billows.</p>
<p>IX. “Hardly ever do we see such signs deceive us and yet we do not see why it is so.</p>
<p>Ye, too, distinguish the signs, ye dwellers in waters delightful,</p>
<p>When, with a clamour, you utter your cries that are empty of meaning,</p>
<p>Stirring the fountains and ponds with absurd and ridiculous croaking.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_239_3" id="target_note_LCL154_239_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Who could suppose that frogs had this foresight? And yet they do have by nature some faculty of premonition, clear enough of itself, but too dark for human comprehension.</p>
<p>Slow, clumsy oxen, their glances upturned to the light of the heavens,</p>
<p>Sniff at the air with their nostrils and know it is freighted with moisture.</p>
<p>I do not ask why, since I know what happens.</p>
