<p>“A married woman who was desirous of a child and was in doubt whether she was pregnant or not, dreamed that her womb had been sealed. She referred the dream to an interpreter. He told her that since her womb was sealed conception was impossible. But another interpreter said, ‘You are pregnant, for it is not customary to seal that which is empty.’ Then what is the dream-interpreter’s art other than a means of using one’s wits to deceive? And those incidents which I have given and the numberless ones collected by the Stoics prove nothing whatever except the shrewdness of men who employ slight analogies in order to draw now one inference and now another. There are certain indications from the condition of the pulse and breath and from many other symptoms in sickness by means of which physicians foretell the course of a disease. When pilots see cuttle-fish leaping or dolphins betaking themselves to a haven they believe that a storm is at hand. In such cases signs are given which are traceable to natural causes and explicable by reason, but that is far from true of the dreams spoken of a little while ago.</p>

Then, it is possible, I suppose, to ‘observe’ dreams? If so, how? For they are of infinite variety and there is no imaginable thing too absurd, too involved, or too abnormal for us to dream about it. How, then, is it possible </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL154_533_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL154_533_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup><span class="italic">i.e</span>. of the three mentioned in ii. 60. 124.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL154_533_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
