<p>LI. “Such is the rationale of prophecy by means of frenzy, and that of dreams is not much unlike it. For the revelations made to seers when awake are made to us in sleep. While we sleep and the body lies as if dead, the soul is at its best, because it is then freed from the influence of the physical senses and from the worldly cares that weigh it down. And since the soul has lived from all eternity and has had converse with numberless other souls, it sees everything that exists in nature, provided that moderation and restraint have been used in eating and in drinking, so that the soul is in a condition to watch while the body sleeps. Such is the explanation of divination by dreams.</p>
<p>“At this point it is pertinent to mention Antiphon’s<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_349_1" id="target_note_LCL154_349_1"><sup>1</sup></a> well-known theory of the interpretation of dreams. His view is that the interpreters of dreams depend upon technical skill and not upon inspiration. He has the same view as to the interpretation of oracles and of frenzied utterances; for they all have their interpreters, just as poets have their commentators. Now it is clear that divine nature would have done a vain thing if she had merely created iron, copper, silver, and gold and had not shown us how to reach the veins in which those metals lie; the gift of field crops and orchard fruits would have been useless to the human race without a knowledge of how to cultivate them and prepare them for food; and building material would be of no service without the carpenter’s art to convert it into lumber. So it is with everything that the gods have given for the advantage of mankind, there has been joined some art whereby that advantage may be turned to account. The same is true </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL154_349_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL154_349_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup><span class="italic">Cf</span>. i. 20. 39.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL154_349_1').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
