<p>The Etruscans, it is true, find the author of their system in the boy who was ploughed up out of the ground ; but whom have we? Attus Navius? But Romulus and Remus, both of whom, by tradition, were augurs, lived many years earlier. Are we to say that it was invented by the Pisidians, Cilicians, or Phrygians? It is your judgement, then, that those devoid of <span class="italic">human</span> learning are the authors of a <span class="italic">divine</span> science!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_463_1" id="target_note_LCL154_463_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>XXXIX. “‘But,’ you say, ‘all kings, peoples, and nations employ auspices.’ As if there were anything so absolutely common as want of sense, or as if you yourself in deciding anything would accept the opinion of the mob! How often will you find a man who will say that pleasure is not a good! Most people actually call it the highest good. Then will the Stoics abandon their views about pleasure because the crowd is against them? or do you think that the multitude follows the lead of the Stoics in very many matters? What wonder, then, if in auspices and in every kind of divination weak minds should adopt the superstitious practices which you have mentioned and should be unable to discern the truth? Moreover, there is no uniformity, and no consistent and constant agreement between augurs. Ennius, speaking with reference to the Roman system of augury, said :</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Then on the left, from out a cloudless sky,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Jove’s thunder rolled its goodly omen forth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_463_2" id="target_note_LCL154_463_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">But Homer’s Ajax<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_463_3" id="target_note_LCL154_463_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in complaining to Achilles of some ferocious deed or other of the Trojans, speaks in this wise :</p>
<blockquote><p>
