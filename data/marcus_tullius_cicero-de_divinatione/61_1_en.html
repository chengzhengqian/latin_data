<p>“The second division of divination, as I said before,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_343_1" id="target_note_LCL154_343_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is the natural; and it, according to the exact teaching of physics, must be ascribed to divine Nature, from which, as the wisest philosophers maintain, our souls have been drawn and poured forth. And since the universe is wholly filled with the Eternal Intelligence and the Divine Mind, it must be that human souls are influenced by their contact with divine souls.

Such men we may call ‘foresighted’—that is, ‘able to foresee the future’; but we can no more apply the term ‘divine’ to them than we can apply it to Thales of Miletus, who, as the story goes, in order to confound his critics and thereby show that even a philosopher, if he sees fit, can make money, bought up the entire olive crop in the district of Miletus </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL154_343_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL154_343_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>i. 18. 34.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL154_343_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL154_343_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL154_343_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup><span class="italic">Cf</span>.
