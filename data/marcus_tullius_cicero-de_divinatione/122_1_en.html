<p class="noindent">So we regard signs on the left as best—Greeks and barbarians, those on the right. And yet I am aware that we call favourable signs <span class="italic">sinistra</span>, or ‘left-hand’ signs, even though they may be on the right.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_465_1" id="target_note_LCL154_465_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Undoubtedly our ancestors in choosing the left side and foreign nations the right were both influenced by what experience had shown them was the more favourable quarter in most cases. What a conflict this is! In view, then, of the differences between different nations in the responses, in the manner in which observations are made and in the kinds of birds and signs employed, need I assert that divination is compounded of a little error, a little superstition, and a good deal of fraud?</p>

For while on the watch for these ‘oracles’ of yours could you be so free and calm of mind that you would have reason and not superstition to guide your course? Now, if a person in the course of his own business or conversation should make some remark, and a word spoken by him happened to apply to what you were doing or thinking, do you really believe that such an accident should cause you either fear or joy?
