<span class="line">Implored Apollo’s aid to understand</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">What great events the vision did foretell.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Apollo’s oracle, with voice divine,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then gave this explanation of the dream :</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">“Thy next-born son forbear to rear, for he</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Will be the death of Pergamos and Troy.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Grant, I repeat, that these dreams are myths and in the same category put Aeneas’s dream, related in the Greek annals of our countryman, Fabius Pictor. According to Pictor everything that Aeneas did or suffered turned out just as it had been predicted to him in a dream.</p>
<p>XXII. “But let us look at examples nearer our own times. Would you dare call that famous dream of Tarquin the Proud a myth? He describes it himself in the following lines from the <span class="italic">Brutus</span> of Accius :</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">At night’s approach I sought my quiet couch</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To soothe my weary limbs with restful sleep.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then in my dreams a shepherd near me drove</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A fleecy herd whose beauty was extreme.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">I chose two brother rams from out the flock</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And sacrificed the comelier of the twain.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And then, with lowered horns, the other ram</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Attacked and bore me headlong to the ground.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">While there I lay outstretched and wounded sore,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The sky a wondrous miracle disclosed :</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The blazing star of day reversed its course</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And glided to the right by pathway new.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now observe how the diviners interpreted this dream :</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">It is not strange, O king, that dreams reflect</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The day’s desires and thoughts, its sights and deeds,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And everything we say or do awake.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But in so grave a dream as yours we see</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A message clearly sent, and thus it warns :</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Beware of him you deem bereft of wit</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And rate no higher than a stupid ram,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Lest he, with wisdom armed, should rise to fame</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And drive you from your throne. The sun’s changed course</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
