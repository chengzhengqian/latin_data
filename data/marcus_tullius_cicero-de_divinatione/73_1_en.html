Now, if it is known by observation and experience that these means of divination have their source in nature, it must be that the observations made and records kept for a long period of time have added much to our knowledge of this subject. Hence, that natural philosopher introduced by Pacuvius into his play of <span class="italic">Chryses</span>, seems to show very scanty apprehension of the laws of nature when he speaks as follows :</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">The men who know the speech of birds and more</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Do learn from other livers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_367_1" id="target_note_LCL154_367_1"><sup>1</sup></a> than their own—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">‘Twere best to hear, I think, and not to heed.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">I do not know why this poet makes such a statement when only a few lines further on he says clearly enough :</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Whate’er the power may be, it animates,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Creates, gives form, increase, and nourishment</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To everything; of everything the sire,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">It takes all things unto itself and hides</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Within its breast; and as from it all things</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Arise, likewise to it all things return.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_367_2" id="target_note_LCL154_367_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Since all things have one and the same and that a common home, and since the human soul has always been and will always be, why, then, should it not be able to understand what effect will follow any cause, and what sign will precede any event?</p>
<p>“This,” said Quintus, “is all that I had to say on divination.”</p>
