Things which are to be do not suddenly spring into existence, but the evolution of time is like the unwinding of a cable : it creates nothing new and only unfolds each event in its order. This connexion between cause and effect is obvious to two classes of diviners : those who are endowed with natural divination and those who know the course of events by the observation of signs. They may not discern the causes themselves, yet they do discern the signs and tokens of those causes. The careful study and recollection of those signs, aided by the records of former times, has evolved that sort of divination, known as artificial, which is divination by means of entrails, lightnings, portents, and celestial phenomena.</p>
<p>“Therefore it is not strange that diviners have a presentiment of things that exist nowhere in the material world : for all things ‘are,’ though, from the standpoint of ‘time,’ they are not present. As in seeds there inheres the germ of those things which the seeds produce, so in causes are stored the future events whose coming is foreseen by reason or conjecture, or is discerned by the soul when inspired by frenzy, or when it is set free by sleep. Persons familiar with the rising, setting, and revolutions of the sun, moon, and other celestial bodies, can tell long in advance where any one of these bodies will be at a given time. And the same thing may be said of men who, for a long period of time, have studied and noted the course of facts and the connexion of events, for they always know what the future will be; or, if that is putting it too strongly, they know in a majority of cases; or, if that will not be conceded either, then, surely, they sometimes know what the future will be. </p></section><notes></notes></section>
