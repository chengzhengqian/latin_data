But the Etruscans, being in their nature of a very ardent religious temperament and accustomed to the frequent sacrifice of victims, have given their chief attention to the study of entrails. And as on account of the density of the atmosphere signs from heaven were common among them, and furthermore since that atmospheric condition caused many phenomena both of earth and sky and also certain prodigies that occur in the conception and birth of men and cattle—for these reasons the Etruscans have become very proficient in the interpretation of portents. Indeed, the inherent force of these means of divination, as you like to observe,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_325_1" id="target_note_LCL154_325_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is clearly shown by the very words so aptly chosen by our ancestors to describe them. Because they ‘make manifest’ (<span class="italic">ostendunt</span>), ‘portend’ (<span class="italic">portendunt</span>), ‘intimate’ (<span class="italic">monstrant</span>), ‘predict’ (<span class="italic">praedicunt</span>), they are called ‘manifestations,’ ‘portents,’ ‘intimations,’ and ‘prodigies.’ But the Arabians, Phrygians, and Cilicians, being chiefly engaged in the rearing of cattle, are constantly wandering over the plains and mountains in winter and summer and, on that account, have found it quite easy to study the songs and flights of birds. The same is true of the Pisidians and of our fellow-countrymen, the Umbrians. While the Carians, and especially the Telmessians, already mentioned, because they live in a country with a very rich and prolific soil, whose fertility produces many abnormal growths, have turned their attention to the study of prodigies.</p>
