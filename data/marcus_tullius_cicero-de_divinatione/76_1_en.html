<p>After publishing the works mentioned I finished three volumes <span class="italic">On the Nature of the Gods</span>, which contain a discussion of every question under that head. With a view of simplifying and extending the latter treatise I started to write the present volume <span class="italic">On Divination</span>, to which I plan to add a work on <span class="italic">Fate</span>; when that is done every phase of this particular branch of philosophy will be sufficiently discussed. To this list of works must be added the six volumes which I wrote while holding the helm of state, entitled <span class="italic">On the Republic</span>—a weighty subject, appropriate for philosophic discussion, and one which has been most elaborately treated by Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and the entire Peripatetic school. What need is there to say anything of my treatise <span class="italic">On Consolation</span>? For it is the source of very great comfort to me and will, I think, be of much help to others. I have also recently thrown in that book <span class="italic">On Old Age</span>, which I sent my friend Atticus; and, since it is by philosophy that a man is made virtuous and strong, my <span class="italic">Cato</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_373_1" id="target_note_LCL154_373_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is especially worthy of a place among the foregoing books. Inasmuch as Aristotle and Theophrastus, too, both of whom were celebrated for their keenness of intellect and particularly for their copiousness of speech, have joined rhetoric with philosophy, it seems proper also to put my rhetorical books in the same category; hence we shall include the three volumes <span class="italic">On Oratory</span>, the fourth entitled <span class="italic">Brutus</span>, and the fifth called <span class="italic">The Orator</span>.</p>
<p>II. I have named the philosophic works so far written : to the completion of the remaining books of this series I was hastening with so much ardour that if some most grievous cause<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_373_2" id="target_note_LCL154_373_2"><sup>2</sup></a> had not inter­vened
