<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Be patient, men ; with fortitude endure</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Your grievous tasks till we can ascertain</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">If what our Calchas prophesies be true,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or only idle fancies of his breast.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">For all who have not left the light of day,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In gloomy shades to dwell, retain these signs</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Imprinted on their minds. When Aulis first</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Was decked with Grecian fleets, which carried death</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">For Priam, ruin for Troy, we stood about</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The fountains cool and sought to please the gods</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With gold-crowned bulls on smoking altars laid.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Beneath the plane-tree’s shade, whence gushed a spring,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">We saw a frightful dragon, huge of size,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With mighty folds, forth from an altar come,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">By Jove impelled. It seized some sparrows hid</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Within the plane-tree’s leafy boughs and eight</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Devoured ; the ninth—the mother bird—began</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">To flutter round and utter plaintive cries :</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">From her the cruel beast her vitals tore.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Now when the mother and her tender brood</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Were slain, the son of Saturn who had sent</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The dragon forth, took it away ; and then</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Did change its form into enduring stone.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In fear we stood and watched the monster strange,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">As midst the altars of the gods it moved.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then Calchas, full of courage, thus did speak :</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">‘Why paralysed with sudden fear, O Greeks?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">These signs divine were sent by Jove himself.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And though these tardy signs were long delayed,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Their fame and glory will for ever live.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The number of the birds ye saw destroyed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">By horrid tooth, portends how many years</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Of war we shall endure in front of Troy.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The tenth year Troy will fall and then her fate</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Will satisfy the Greeks.’ Thus Calchas spoke</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And what he prophesied ye see fulfilled.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
