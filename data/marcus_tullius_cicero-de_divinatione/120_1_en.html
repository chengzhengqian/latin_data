He separated from Pompey—an occasion of sorrow! He beheld Caesar at once his enemy and his guest —what could have been more distressing than that? Caesar wrested from him the tetrarchy over the Trocmi and conferred it upon some obscure sycophant of his own from Pergamus ; deprived him of Armenia, a gift from the Senate ; accepted a most lavish hospitality at the hands of his royal host and left him utterly despoiled. But I wander too far : I must return to the point at issue. If we examine this matter from the standpoint of the results—and that was the question submitted to the determination of the birds—the issue was in no sense favourable to Deiotarus ; but if we examine it from the standpoint of duty, he sought information on that score not from the auspices, but from his own conscience.</p>

Again, how, when, and by whom, shall we say that the system was invented?</p>
