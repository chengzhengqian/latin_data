<p>“Now—to employ you as often as I can as my authority—what could be more clearly of divine origin than the auspice which is thus described in your <span class="italic">Marius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_339_1" id="target_note_LCL154_339_1"><sup>1</sup></a>?</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Behold, from out the tree, on rapid wing,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">The eagle that attends high-thundering Jove</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A serpent bore, whose fangs had wounded her ;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And as she flew her cruel talons pierced</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Quite through its flesh. The snake, tho’ nearly dead,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Kept darting here and there its spotted head ;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And, as it writhed, she tore with bloody beak</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Its twisted folds. At last, with sated wrath</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And grievous wounds avenged, she dropped her prey,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Which, dead and mangled, fell into the sea ;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And from the West she sought the shining East.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">When Marius, reader of divine decrees,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Observed the bird’s auspicious, gliding course,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He recognized the goodly sign foretold</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That he in glory would return to Rome;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then, on the left, Jove’s thunder pealed aloud</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And thus declared the eagle’s omen true.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>XLVIII. “As for that augural art of Romulus of which I spoke, it was pastoral and not city-bred, nor was it ‘invented to gull the ignorant,’ but received by trustworthy men, who handed it on to their descendants. And so we read in Ennius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_339_2" id="target_note_LCL154_339_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the following story of Romulus, who was an augur, and of his brother Remus, who also was an augur :</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">When each would rule they both at once appealed</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Their claims, with anxious hearts, to augury.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then Remus took the auspices alone</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And waited for the lucky bird; while on</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
