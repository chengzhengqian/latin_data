Then what do the gods mean by sending us in our dreams visions which we cannot understand ourselves and which we cannot find anybody to interpret for us? If the gods send us these unintelligible and inexplicable dream-messages they are acting as Carthaginians and Spaniards would if they were to address our Senate in their own vernacular without the aid of an interpreter. Besides, what purpose is served by dark and enigmatic dreams? Surely the gods ought to want us to understand the advice they give us for our good. ‘Oh!’ but you retort, ‘Are poets and natural philosophers never obscure?’ Indeed they are : Euphorion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_519_1" id="target_note_LCL154_519_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is even too obscure; but Homer is not.
