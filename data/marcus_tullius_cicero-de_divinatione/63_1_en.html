However, since these men make us some concession—and that not a small one—in granting us divination by frenzy and dreams, I see no cause for any great war with them, especially in view of the fact that there are some philosophers who do not accept any sort of divination whatever.</p>
<p>“Those then, whose souls, spurning their bodies, take wings and fly abroad—inflamed and aroused by a sort of passion—these men, I say, certainly see the things which they foretell in their prophecies. Such souls do not cling to the body and are kindled by many different influences. For example, some are aroused by certain vocal tones, as by Phrygian songs, many by groves and forests, and many others by rivers and seas. I believe, too, that there were certain subterranean vapours which had the effect of inspiring persons to utter oracles.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_347_1" id="target_note_LCL154_347_1"><sup>1</sup></a> In all these cases the frenzied soul sees the future long in advance, as Cassandra did in the following instance :</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Alas! behold! some mortal will decide</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A famous case between three goddesses :</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Because of that decision there will come</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">It is in this state of exaltation that many predictions have been made, not only in prose but also</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">In verse which once the fauns and bards did sing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_347_3" id="target_note_LCL154_347_3"><sup>3</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Likewise Marcius and Publicius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_347_4" id="target_note_LCL154_347_4"><sup>4</sup></a> according to tradition, made their prophecies in verse, and the cryptic utterances of Apollo were expressed in the same form.</p>
