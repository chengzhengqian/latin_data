<p>“Wherefore, it seems to me that we must do as Posidonius does and trace the vital principle of divination in its entirety to three sources : first, to God, whose connexion with the subject has been sufficiently discussed; secondly to Fate; and lastly, to Nature. Reason compels us to admit that all things happen by Fate. Now by Fate I mean the same that the Greeks call εἰμαρμένη, that is, an orderly succession of causes wherein cause is linked to cause and each cause of itself produces an effect. That is an immortal truth having its source in all eternity. Therefore nothing has happened which was not bound to happen, and, likewise, nothing is going to happen which will not find in nature every efficient cause of its happening.

For he who knows the causes of future events necessarily knows what every future event will be. But since such knowledge is possible only to a god, it is left to man to presage the future by means of certain </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL154_361_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL154_361_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>The genuineness of the words, <span class="italic">id quod... ostendetur</span>, is doubted because (1) in the extant portions of Cicero’s work on Fate the opposite of the position here contended for is taken; and (2) they indicate that Marcus, forgetting for the moment that Quintus is talking, imagines that he himself is the speaker.
