<p>XXVII. “‘Reports,’ you say, ‘were made to the Senate that there was a shower of blood, that the river Atratus actually flowed with blood and that the statues of the gods dripped with sweat.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_437_1" id="target_note_LCL154_437_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You do not think for a moment that Thales, Anaxagoras, or any other natural philosopher would have believed such reports? Sweat and blood you may be sure do not come except from animate bodies. An effect strikingly like blood is produced by the admixture of water with certain kinds of soil; and the moisture which forms on the outside of objects, as we see it on our plastered walls when the south wind blows, seems to resemble sweat. Such occurrences, which in time of war appear to the timid to be most frequent and most real, are scarcely noticed in times of peace. Moreover, in periods of fear and of danger stories of portents are not only more readily believed, but they are invented with greater impunity. But are we simple and thoughtless enough to think it a portent for mice to gnaw something, when gnawing is their one business in life? ‘But,’ you say, ‘the fact that just before the Marsian War mice gnawed the shields at Lanuvium was pronounced by the soothsayers to be a very direful portent.’<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_437_2" id="target_note_LCL154_437_2"><sup>2</sup></a> As if it mattered a whit whether mice, which are gnawing something day and night, gnawed shields or sieves! Hence, by the same token, the fact that, at my house, mice recently gnawed my Plato’s <span class="italic">Republic</span> should fill me with alarm for the Roman republic; or if they had gnawed my Epicurus <span class="italic">On Pleasure</span> I should have expected a rise in the market price of food!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_437_3" id="target_note_LCL154_437_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
