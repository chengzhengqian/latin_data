In fact, he used to say that, if he wished to execute some manœuvre which he did not want interfered with by the auspices, he would travel in a closed litter.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_459_2" id="target_note_LCL154_459_2"><sup>2</sup></a> His method is of a kind with the advice which we augurs give, that the draught-cattle be ordered to be unyoked so as to prevent a <span class="italic">iuge auspicium</span>.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_459_3" id="target_note_LCL154_459_3"><sup>3</sup></a> What else does a refusal to be warned by Jove accomplish except either to prevent an auspice from occurring, or, if it occurs, to prevent it from being seen?</p>
