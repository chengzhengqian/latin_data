preserve the name. For just as to-day on important occasions we make use of entrails in divining—though even they are employed to a less extent than formerly—so in the past resort was usually had to divination by means of birds. And thus it is that by failing to seek out the unpropitious signs we run into awful disasters. For example, Publius Claudius, son of Appius Caecus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_257_1" id="target_note_LCL154_257_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and his colleague Lucius Junius, lost very large fleets by going to sea when the auguries were adverse.

I grant you that in pursuing the course he did Appius was within his rights as a censor, if, in his judgement, Ateius had announced a fraudulent augury. But he showed no capacity whatever as an augur in holding Ateius responsible for that awful disaster which befell the Roman people. Had this been the cause then the fault would not have been in Ateius, who made the announcement that the augury was unfavourable, but in Crassus, who disobeyed it; for the issue proved that the announce­ament </p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL154_257_1"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL154_257_1" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">1</sup>In the first Punic War 249 <span class="sc">b.c</span>.; <span class="italic">cf</span>.
