<p>Here was the Martian beast, the nurse of Roman dominion,</p>
<p>Suckling with life-giving dew, that issued from udders distended,</p>
<p>Children divinely begotten, who sprang from the loins of the War God;</p>
<p>Stricken by lightning she toppled to earth, bearing with her the children;</p>
<p>Torn from her station, she left the prints of her feet in descending.</p>
<p>Then what diviner, in turning the records and tomes of the augurs,</p>
<p>Failed to relate the mournful forecasts the Etruscans had written?</p>
<p>Seers all advised to beware the monstrous destruction and slaughter,</p>
<p>Plotted by Romans who traced their descent from a noble ancestry;</p>
<p>Or they proclaimed the law’s overthrow with voices insistent,</p>
<p>Bidding us rescue the city from flames, and the deities’ temples;</p>
<p>Fearful they bade us become of horrible chaos and carnage;</p>
<p>These, by a rigorous Fate, would be certainly fixed and determined,</p>
<p>Were not a sacred statue of Jove, one comely of figure,</p>
<p>High on a column erected beforehand, with eyes to the eastward;</p>
<p>Then would the people and venerable senate be able to fathom Hidden designs, when that statue—its face to the sun at its rising—</p>
<p>Should behold from its station the seats of the people and Senate.</p>
<p>Long was the statue delayed and much was it hindered in making.</p>
<p>Finally, you being consul, it stood in its lofty position.</p>
<p>Just at the moment of time, which the gods had set and predicted,</p>
<p>When on column exalted the sceptre of Jove was illumined,</p>
<p>Did Allobrogian voices proclaim to Senate and people</p>
<p>What destruction by dagger and torch was prepared for our country. <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL154_247_1" id="target_note_LCL154_247_1"><sup>247</sup></a></p>
