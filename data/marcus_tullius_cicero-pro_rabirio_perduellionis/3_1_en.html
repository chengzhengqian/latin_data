Since this is so, I, as in duty bound where<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span> a manâ€™s life and honour and all his fortunes are at stake, first beg of most high and mighty Jupiter and all the other immortal gods and goddesses by whose help and assistance the Republic is directed rather than by the counsel and deliberation of man, to grant me their grace and favour; and I pray that by their will this day that has dawned may see the salvation of my client and the establishment of our constitution. And next I beg and beseech you, gentlemen, whose power is second only to that of divine Providence, to remember that to your hands and to your votes are committed at one and the same time the life of the hapless and innocent Gaius Rabirius and the welfare of the Republic; and accordingly to display your usual clemency in dealing with the fortunes of the prisoner, your usual wisdom in securing the well-being of the Republic.</p>
<p>And now, Titus Labienus, since you have put a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span> check on my industry by shortening the time at my disposal and have cut down the appropriate and customary period for the defence to the narrow limits of a single half-hour,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_457_a" id="target_note_LCL198_457_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I must submit to injustice in yielding to the terms of the prosecution and to misfortune in deferring to the prerogative of an enemy. In thus confining me to half an hour, you have left me my part as an advocate but have robbed me of my part as a consul; for the time at my disposal, though almost long enough for my defence, will be too short for my protest. Or perhaps you expect me to reply<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>
