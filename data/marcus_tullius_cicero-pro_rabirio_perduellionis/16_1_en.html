<p>Indeed, if Titus Labienus has thought fit to erect a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">28</span><span class="br"></span> cross on the Campus Martius for Gaius Rabirius because he took up arms, what punishment shall be devised for the man who summoned him to arms? And if, as you are so fond of asserting, a promise of safety was given to Saturninus, it was not Rabirius but Marius who gave it; and Marius, too, who broke it if it was not kept.
