And Sextus Titius also was condemned for having a portrait of Saturninus in his house. The Roman Knights by their verdict on that occasion branded as a worthless citizen, unfit to remain in the citizen body, anyone who, by keeping the portrait<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_479_a" id="target_note_LCL198_479_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of a man whose sedition made him a public enemy, either did honour to his death or, by exciting the pity of the uninstructed, caused them to regret him or showed an inclination on his own part to imitate such villainy. And so I find it difficult to imagine where you,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">25</span><span class="br"></span> Labienus, found the portrait which you have here. For since the condemnation of Sextus Titius no one has been found with the courage to have such a thing in his possession. Had you been told of this incident or been old enough to know about it, I am sure you would never have paraded on the platform of a public assembly a portrait like that, which, when merely placed in his house, brought ruin and exile on Sextus Titius, and you would never have driven your bark upon those rocks on which you had seen the ship of Sextus Titius dashed in pieces and the fortunes of Gaius Decianus completely wrecked.</p>
<p>But throughout this whole case, ignorance is your stumbling-block. For in bringing into court a cause which was dead before you were born, a cause in which you would certainly have been involved if you had been old enough, do you not realize in the first<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> place who are the men, how distinguished the citizens, whom you are accusing, now that they are dead, of a monstrous crime; and again, how many still alive
