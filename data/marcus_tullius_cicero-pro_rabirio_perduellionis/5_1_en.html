Or why should I prepare a long speech in answer to the point which was laboured on that same occasion when it was proposed to fine Rabirius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_461_a" id="target_note_LCL198_461_a"><sup>a</sup></a>—I mean the statement that he had respected neither his own chastity nor that of others? Actually, I suspect that the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">9</span><span class="br"></span> reason why Labienus cut down my time to half an hour was to prevent my enlarging on the topic of chastity! And so, as for the charges which demand my labours as an advocate, you realize that the half hour which you have allowed me has proved more than long enough: it was the other part of my speech dealing with the death of Saturninus, that you desired should be reduced and curtailed; and that part stands in crying need, not of a pleader’s skill but of a consul’s intervention.</p>
<p>Now as for your constant allegation that I have<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">10</span><span class="br"></span> abolished the procedure for High Treason,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_461_b" id="target_note_LCL198_461_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that is a charge against me, not against Rabirius. Nay, gentlemen, would that it were I who was either the first or the only man to have abolished it from our country! I would that, though Labienus makes it a charge against me, I might appropriate it as evidence of my glory. For what is so greatly to be desired that I should prefer it to the claim of having in my consulship abolished the executioner from the Forum, the cross from the Campus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_461_c" id="target_note_LCL198_461_c"><sup>c</sup></a>? But that glory, gentlemen, belongs in the first place to our forefathers who, when they drove out the kings, retained among a free people no trace of their cruel ways; and in the second place to many brave men who intended that your liberty should not be made offensive by savage punishments but safeguarded only by mild laws.</p>
