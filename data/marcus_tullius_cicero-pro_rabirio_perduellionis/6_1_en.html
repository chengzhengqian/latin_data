<p>IV. Which, then, of us two, Labienus, is the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> peopleâ€™s friend? You, who think it right to threaten Roman citizens even in the midst of their assembly with the executioner and with bonds; who, on the Campus Martius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_463_a" id="target_note_LCL198_463_a"><sup>a</sup></a> at the Assembly of the Centuries,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL198_463_b" id="target_note_LCL198_463_b"><sup>b</sup></a> in that holy place, give orders for the construction and erection of a cross for the punishment of citizens; or I, who refuse to allow the assembly to be defiled by contact with the executioner; who assert that the Forum of the Roman people must be purified from those traces of hideous crime, who urge against you the need to keep the assembly undefiled, the Campus holy, the person of every Roman citizen inviolable, the rights of a free people unimpaired?
