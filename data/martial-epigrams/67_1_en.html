<p class="noindent">You give kisses to some, to others you give your hand, Postumus. You say: “Which do you prefer? Make your choice.” I prefer the hand.</p>

<p class="noindent">What do I want with you, o Phoebus and Sisters Nine? See, the playful Muse harms her poet. Postumus used to kiss me with half his lips, now he’s started doing it with both.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL094_145_24" id="target_note_LCL094_145_24">

<p class="noindent">I shan’t tell you people, though you ask me and ask, who is Postumus in my little book, no, I shan’t tell you. What call have I to offend these kissings that can so well take their revenge?</p>

<p class="noindent">If unkind Fortune should put you in the sad situation of a man on trial, I shall stand by you in mourning, paler than the accused. If she have you found guilty and order you to leave your native land, I shall bear the exile company through seas and cliffs. She gives you riches. Are they for us both? Do you give me a half share? “That’s a lot.” Candidus, do you give me anything? Very well, in trouble you will be with me, but if the god nods with face serene, in prosperity, Candidus, you will be alone.</p>
