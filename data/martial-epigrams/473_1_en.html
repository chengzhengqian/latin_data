<p class="noindent">Morning client, reason why I left Rome,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_149_106" id="target_note_LCL480_149_106">
<sup>106</sup>
</a> if you were sensible,
you would dance attendance on pretentious halls. I
am no advocate nor apt for bitter lawsuits, but lazy and elderly
and a companion of the Pierian maids. I am fond of
leisure and sleep, which great Rome denied me. If I’m
kept awake here too, I go back.</p>

<p class="noindent">Paulus, to you your friends are all genuine, like your pictures
and cups.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_149_107" id="target_note_LCL480_149_107">

<p class="noindent">Not long ago, when a bow-legged, home-bred slave carried
Aper’s towels and a one-eyed old woman sat watching over
his little gown and a ruptured masseur handed him his
drop of oil, he was a stern, harsh censor of boozers. He
would shout that the cups should be smashed and the
Falernian poured away which a knight, fresh from his bath,
was imbibing. But now that three hundred thousand has
come his way from an aged uncle, he doesn’t know how to
go home from the baths sober. Oh, what a difference openwork
goblets and five longhaired boys can make! When
Aper was poor, he wasn’t thirsty.</p>
