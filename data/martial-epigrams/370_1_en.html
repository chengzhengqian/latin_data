<p>When you swear, Lesbia, that you were born in Brutus’ consulship, you lie. Were you born, Lesbia, in Numa’s reign? You lie even so. For, as they recount your centuries, you are said to have been molded from Prometheus’ clay.</p>

<p>I was always being told that my Polla was closeted with a queen. So I burst in, Lupus. He was no queen.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL095_355_78" id="target_note_LCL095_355_78">

Not, as generally believed, a <span class="italic">cunnilingus</span> or an <span class="italic">irrumator</span>, but an honest-to-God adulterer. The best commentary is in the Bodleian fragment of Juvenal, thus paraphrased by Housman, 481: “Wherever a cinaedus is kept he taints the household . . . Them do women consult about marriage and divorce . . . from them do they learn lascivious motions and whatever else the teacher knows. But beware: that teacher is not always what he seems: true, he darkens his eyes and dresses like a woman, but adultery is his design. Mistrust him the more for his show of effeminacy: he is a valiant mattress-knight.
