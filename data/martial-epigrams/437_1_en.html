<p class="noindent">He lies, Zoilus, who says you are vicious. You are not a
vicious man, Zoilus, you’re vice.</p>

<p class="noindent">Fire has consumed the Pierian home of poet Theodorus.
Does this please the Muses and you, Phoebus? Oh crime,
oh monstrous villainy and reproach to heaven!—that house
and householder did not perish together.</p>

<p class="noindent">That you are green with jealousy and run down my little
books wherever you go, I forgive: circumcised poet, you
show your sense.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_77_116" id="target_note_LCL480_77_116">

</a> This too leaves me indifferent, that you
plunder my poems while you carp at them: circumcised
poet, herein also you show your sense. What does upset
me is that born in Jerusalem itself you sodomize my boy,
circumcised poet. So! You deny it, you swear to me by
the temple of the Thunderer. I don’t believe you. Swear,
circumcised one, by Anchialus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_77_117a" id="target_note_LCL480_77_117a">

famous epitaph (Cic. <span class="italic">Tusc.</span> 5.101). The libertine from Jerusalem is
told that he should be swearing, not by Jupiter’s temple on the
Capitol (note that M. does not say “by Jupiter”), but by the oriental
