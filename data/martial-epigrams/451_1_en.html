<p class="noindent">While you perhaps, Juvenal, wander restlessly in noisy
Subura or tread Lady Diana’s hill,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_105_24" id="target_note_LCL480_105_24">
<sup>24</sup>
</a> while your sweating
gown fans you as you cross the thresholds of the powerful
and the Greater and Lesser Caelian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_105_25" id="target_note_LCL480_105_25">
<sup>25</sup>
</a> tire out the wanderer:
me my Bilbilis, proud of her gold and iron, revisited
after many Decembers, has received and made a rustic.
Here in idleness I exert myself pleasantly to visit Boterdus
and Platea (such are the uncouth names in Celtiberian
lands). I enjoy an enormous, indecent amount of sleep, often
unbroken till past the third hour, and pay myself back
in full now for my vigils of thirty years. The gown is unknown,
but when I ask I am handed the nearest garment to
hand from a broken chair.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_105_26" id="target_note_LCL480_105_26">
<sup>26</sup>
</a> When I get up, a fireplace welcomes
me stocked with a proud pile of logs from an adjacent
oak wood and crowned by the bailiff’s wife with many
a pot. The huntsman comes next, but one that you would
like to have with you in a secret grove. The smooth-skinned
bailiff gives my boys their rations and asks me to let him cut
his long hair. So fain would I live, so fain would I die.</p>
