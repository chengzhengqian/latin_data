<p class="noindent">Here lies one who was wont to bind his brows with a
Pierian garland, a voice no less famous among frightened
men on trial, here, Sempronia, your Rufus, whose very
dust glows with love for you. Your story, a sweet romance,
is told in the Elysian Fields, and Tyndareus’ daughter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_133_74" id="target_note_LCL480_133_74">
<sup>74</sup>
</a>
herself is lost in amazement at your ravishing. [But you
are better than she, for you forsook your ravisher and returned,
whereas she would not follow her husband even
when reclaimed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_133_75" id="target_note_LCL480_133_75">
<sup>75</sup>
</a>] Menelaus smiles as he listens to a tale
of Ilian love; your rape absolves Phrygian Paris. When the
happy places of the virtuous shall one day receive you,
there will be no more famous shade in the house of Styx.
Proserpina looks with no unsympathetic eye on ravished
women, she loves them.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_133_76" id="target_note_LCL480_133_76">
<sup>76</sup>
</a> Your love story will win you Her
Majesty’s good will.</p>
<h3>53</h3>
<p class="noindent">Though you have money, Paternus, such wealth as few citizens
possess, you give nothing away and brood over your
treasure like the great dragon that once, as poets sing, was
guardian of the Scythian grove.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_133_77" id="target_note_LCL480_133_77">
<sup>77</sup>
</a> But the reason, as you
yourself relate and spread abroad, is a son of dire rapacity.
Are you looking for simpletons, greenhorns whom you
can fool and rob of sense? To this vice you have always
been father.</p>
