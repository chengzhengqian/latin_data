<p class="noindent">Do you wish to know why it is, Ligurinus, that nobody is glad to meet you, that, wherever you go, there is flight and a vast solitude around you? You are too much of a poet. This is a very dangerous fault. A tigress roused by the theft of her cubs is not feared so much, nor yet a viper burnt by the midday sun, nor yet a vicious scorpion. For I ask you, who would endure such trials? You read to me as I stand, you read to me as I sit, you read to me as I run, you read to me as I shit. I flee to the baths: you boom in my ear. I head for the pool: I’m not allowed to swim. I hurry to dinner: you stop me in my tracks. I arrive at dinner: you drive me away as I eat.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL094_219_51" id="target_note_LCL094_219_51">

</a> Tired out, I take a nap: you rouse me as I lie. Do you care to see how much damage you do? A just man, upright and innocent, you are feared.</p>

</a> fled Thyestes’ dinner table or not, I don’t know; but we flee yours, Ligurinus. Elegant indeed it is, furnished with lordly repasts, but nothing in the world gives pleasure when you are reciting. I don’t want you to serve me turbot or a two-pounder mullet, nor do I want mushrooms, oysters I don’t want: shut up.</p>
