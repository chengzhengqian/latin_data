<h2><span class="ac">Book I</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">I hope to have struck a balance in my little books such that nobody can complain of them who has a good opinion of himself; their jesting is with respect of persons, even the humblest, respect which was so lacking in writers of old that they made free not only with real names, but even with great ones. I would not have fame at such a price; ingenuity is the last quality for which I seek approval. My quips are straightforward. I want no interpreter’s malice, and beg that nobody write addresses on my epigrams. It is a scurvy trick to be ingenious with another man’s book. As for the license I use in calling a spade a spade, the language of epigram that is to say, I should make apology if the example were of my setting. But that is how Catullus writes, and Marsus, and Pedo, and Gaetulicus, and whoever else is read all through. However, should any man so flaunt his prudery that Latin cannot be spoken on any page in his presence, he can make do with my letter, or better, my title. Epigrams are written for those who use to watch Flora’s games. Let Cato keep out of my theater; or if he comes in, let him watch.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL094_41_1" id="target_note_LCL094_41_1"><sup>1</sup></a> I think I shall be within my rights if I conclude my letter in verse:</p>
