<p class="noindent">Unicus, you that bear a name joined to mine by kindred
blood and a mind close to mine in literary pursuits, you
write poetry second only to your brother’s; yet your talent
is no less than his, but your affection is greater. Lesbia
could have loved you along with witty Catullus, beguiling
Corinna could have followed you after Naso. And if you
had wished to spread your sails, Zephyrs were not wanting;
but you love the shore. This too you owe your brother.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_127_63" id="target_note_LCL480_127_63">

<p class="noindent">You cover your temples and the top of your bare bald pate
with a kid’s skin. It was a witty saying when somebody told
you, Phoebus, that your head is well shod.</p>

<p class="noindent">You are difficult and easy, pleasant and sour; and I can’t live
with you nor yet without you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_127_64" id="target_note_LCL480_127_64">

wrote satires to avoid competition with a brother who wrote tragedies.
U. wrote love elegies, and could have excelled in a more
ambitious genre, but out of brotherly affection refrained; so that
this very modesty was something he owed to his brother. M. was of
course aware of the surface meaning, “in this too you take after
your brother,” but the epigram makes no sense if the brother too
was an elegist (<span class="italic">
