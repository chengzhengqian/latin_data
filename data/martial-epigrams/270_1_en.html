<h2><span class="ac">Book VIII</span></h2>

<span class="sc">to the emperor domitianus caesar augustus germanicus dacicus, valerius martialis sends greetings</span>
</h2>
<p>All my little books, Lord, to which you have given fame, which is to say life, are your petitioners, and will be read, I suppose, for that reason. But this one, entitled the eighth of my works, enjoys more frequent opportunities of showing its devotion. So there was less need to labor with invention, since matter had taken its place. However, from time to time I have tried to vary the same by some admixture of jest, lest every line heap its praises upon your celestial modesty, praises which might more easily weary you than satiate us. Furthermore, although epigrams appearing to aim at the verbal license of mime have been written even by men of the strictest morals and the highest station, I have not allowed these here to talk as wantonly as is their custom. Since the greater and better part of the book is bound up with the majesty of your sacred name, let it remember that only persons purified by religious lustration should approach temples. So that prospective readers may know that I shall observe this principle, I have thought proper to announce it on the very threshold of this little book in the briefest of epigrams.</p>
