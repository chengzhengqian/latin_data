<p class="noindent">This, whatever it amounts to, Gaul called by the name of the Roman gown<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL094_191_1a" id="target_note_LCL094_191_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> sends you from distant lands. You read it and perhaps praise its predecessor. That one or this is mine, whichever you think the better.

<p class="noindent">Whose present do you wish to be, little book? Hurry to find yourself a protector, lest hustled off to a sooty kitchen you wrap sprats in your sodden papyrus or become a cowl for incense or pepper. Do you fly to Faustinus’ bosom? You are wise. Now you may walk oiled with cedar, your twin brows handsomely adorned,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL094_191_2" id="target_note_LCL094_191_2">
<sup>2</sup>
</a> luxuriating in your painted bosses, clothed in dainty purple, your proud title blushing scarlet. With him to protect you, have no fear of Probus himself.</p>
