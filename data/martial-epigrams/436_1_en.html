<h3>90</h3>
<p class="noindent">You do not approve of any poems that run on a smooth
path, only of those that stumble among ruts and boulders;
greater to you even than Maeonian song is “little pillar of
Lucilius, here lieth Metrophanes.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_75_112" id="target_note_LCL480_75_112">

</a> In rapt amazement
you read “of fruitful earth,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_75_113" id="target_note_LCL480_75_113">

</a> and whatever Accius and
Pacuvius spew out. Do you wish me to imitate the old
poets, your poets, Chrestillus? Damned if you don’t know
the taste of a cock!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_75_114" id="target_note_LCL480_75_114">

<p class="noindent">Aeolis’ daughter Canace<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_75_115" id="target_note_LCL480_75_115">
<sup>115</sup>
</a> lies buried in this tomb, a little
girl to whom a seventh winter came as her last. “What a
crime, what a villainy!” Traveller hastening to weep, you
must not here complain of life’s short span. Sadder than
her death is the manner of her death. A hideous corruption
stole her face and settled on her tender mouth, a cruel
disease ate her very kisses and mutilated her lips before
they were given to the black pyre. If fate had to come in so
precipitate a flight, it should have come by a different path.
But death hurried to close the channel of her sweet voice,
lest her tongue should prevail to sway the pitiless goddesses.</p>
