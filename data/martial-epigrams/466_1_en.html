<p class="noindent">Red-haired, black-faced, short-footed, boss-eyed, it’s a
great achievement, Zoilus, if you’re a good fellow.</p>

<p class="noindent">Anybody who tells you, girls, to give for nothing is an impudent
jackass. Don’t <span class="italic">give</span> for nothing, kiss for nothing. Aegle
refuses this, this the greedy girl sells. But let her sell it: a
good kiss is a fine thing. She even sells (and for no small
taking; she asks a pound of Cosmus’ scent or else eight
gold pieces, fresh from the mint) that her kisses be not
silent or grudging, that she not bar entrance with closed
lips. But there’s just one thing she’s nice about; Aegle, who
refuses to give a kiss for nothing, does not refuse to lick for
nothing.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_135_78" id="target_note_LCL480_135_78">

Polycharmus, hurts us, not you. For every time you rise
from your bed, you ask your friends for getting-well presents.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_135_79" id="target_note_LCL480_135_79">

For shame, Polycharmus, fall sick now for good
and all.</p>
