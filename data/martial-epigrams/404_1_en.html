for such a ruse has gone by. Under Nerva’s rule you can
be Penelope, but your itch, your old bent, won’t let you.
What will you do, wretched woman? Pretend a sick friend?

the gods, or of a garland just fallen from richly pomaded
locks—why speak of this or that? They are not enough. Mix
them all together: such is the fragrance of my boy’s morning
kisses. Do you wish to know his name? If it’s only on
account of the kisses, I’ll tell you. You swear it. You are too
