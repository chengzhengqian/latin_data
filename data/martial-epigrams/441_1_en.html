<p class="noindent">Your modesty of mind and appearance is such, Safronius,
that I wonder you could make a father.</p>

<p class="noindent">Wife, get out of my house or conform to my ways. I am no
Curius or Numa or Tatius. I like nights drawn out by cups
that cheer: you drink water and hasten sour-faced from
the table. You love the dark: I prefer to sport with a lamp
for witness and to admit the daylight when I’m bursting
my loins. You hide yourself with a brassiere and a tunic and
an obscuring robe: but no girl lies naked enough for me. I
am captivated by kisses that copy blandishing doves: you
give me such as you give your grandmother of a morning.
You don’t deign to help the business along by movement
or voice or fingers, as though you were preparing
incense and wine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_85_128" id="target_note_LCL480_85_128">

</a> The Phrygian slaves used to masturbate
behind the door whenever Hector’s wife sat her horse,
and although the Ithacan was snoring, chaste Penelope
always used to keep her hand <span class="italic">there.</span> You won’t let me
sodomize: Cornelia used to do that favor for Gracchus, and
Julia for Pompey, and Porcia, Brutus, for you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_85_129" id="target_note_LCL480_85_129">

</a> Before
the Dardanian page mixed their sweet cups, Juno was Jupiter’s
Ganymede. If grave manners please you, you may be
Lucretia all day: at night I want Lais.</p>
