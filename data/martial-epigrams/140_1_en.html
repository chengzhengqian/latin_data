<p class="noindent">consul. With you, Postumus, I counted thirty winters. We shared one couch. Now you can afford to give, to squander; you are full of honors, abundant in riches. I wait to see what you will do, Postumus. You do nothing, and it is late in the day for me to look for another patron.

<p class="noindent">If perchance somebody could give me what I ask, hear, Flaccus, what sort of boy I should like to ask for. First, let this boy be born in the land of Nile; no country knows better how to give naughty ways. Let him be whiter than snow; for in dusky Mareotis that complexion gains beauty in proportion to its rarity. Let his eyes rival stars and soft tresses float upon his neck; curly hair, Flaccus, is not to my liking.

Let him often force me when I am not in the mood and refuse me when I am, let him often make freer than his master. Let him have no fear of the boys and often shut out the girls;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL094_291_57" id="target_note_LCL094_291_57">
