<p>me back in kindly mood, I come; if the hearts within you are ungentle, I can return.</p>
<h3>104</h3>
<p>Go, little book, with my Flavus over the far-flung sea; but be the waters kind, and in an easy voyage with favoring winds make for the heights of Spanish Tarraco. Wheels will take you from there, and with rapid travel you will perhaps see lofty Bilbilis and your Salo at the fifth stage. Do you ask my commissions? Please to greet some friends fresh from the road, not many but long-standing, not seen for four and thirty winters; and remind my good Flavus from time to time to find me a pleasant retreat not needing much work at a reasonable price, to make your father lazy. Thatâ€™s all. Now the pompous skipper is calling and berating delays and a fairer breeze has opened the harbor. Good-bye little book. You know, I think, that a ship does not wait for one passenger.</p>
