with oily wax-salve, drop from a frozen nose—none of
these will avail. They kiss you when you’re sweltering and
when you’re shivering and when you’re keeping a kiss for
your bride. A cowled head won’t set you free, nor a litter
screened by skin and curtain, nor will a chair shut in by
barriers protect you; the kisser will enter through every
chink. Not the consulship itself, nor the tribunate or the six

</a> nor the haughty rod of the bawling lictor will
drive off the kisser. Though you sit on a high tribunal and
from curule chair give judgment to nations, the kisser
will climb up one way or another. He will kiss you when you
are in fever and in tears, yawning and swimming—and
shitting. The only remedy for the plague is to make a friend
of someone you would not wish to kiss.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_81_124" id="target_note_LCL480_81_124">

<p class="noindent">Whenever you get up from your chair (I have noticed it
again and again), your unfortunate tunic sodomizes you,
Lesbia. You try and try to pluck it with your left hand and
your right, till you extract it with tears and groans. So firmly
is it constrained by the twin Symplegades of your arse as it
enters your oversized, Cyanean buttocks. Do you want to
correct this ugly fault? I’ll tell you how. Lesbia, I advise you
neither to get up nor sit down.</p>
