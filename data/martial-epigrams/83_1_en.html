<p class="noindent">A story is told about a happening at dinner yesterday evening, Postumus, one that I was sorry to hear of (for who would approve of such goings-on?): that your ears were boxed with a louder smack than when Latinus himself slaps Panniculus’ sorry face.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL094_177_65" id="target_note_LCL094_177_65">
<sup>65</sup>
</a> And what is more remarkable, rumor bruits it all over Rome that the author of this outrage was Caecilius. You say it never happened. Do you want me to believe that? Very well; but Caecilius has witnesses,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL094_177_66" id="target_note_LCL094_177_66">
<sup>66</sup>
</a> Postumus, how about that?</p>

<p class="noindent">Lyris is always saying that she doesn’t know what she is doing when she is drunk. Lyris wants to know what she does? The same as when she’s sober. She sucks.</p>

<p class="noindent">Maternus, do you see Saufeius surrounded by a gowned escort, fore and aft, a crowd as big as takes Regulus home when he has sent a shaven defendant to the lofty temples?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL094_177_67" id="target_note_LCL094_177_67">
<sup>67</sup>
</a> Don’t be jealous. I pray you never have such an entourage. These friends, these gowned cohorts, are furnished to him by Fuficulanus and Faventinus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL094_177_68" id="target_note_LCL094_177_68">
