<p>Greetings, my Toranius, my dearest brother. I addressed the epigram which is placed out of paginal order to the illustrious<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL095_227_1" id="target_note_LCL095_227_1">

</a> who wished to place a bust of me in his library. I thought I should write to you about it, so that you know who this person I call Avitus is. Good-bye and prepare a welcome.</p>
<p>Bard of soul sublime, known to fame, though you desire it not, to whom long hereafter the grave will render meet reward, let this brief verse live under my bust, which you, Avitus, are placing in company not undistinguished:</p>
<p>“I am he whose trifles are praised second to none, whom, reader, you do not wonder at, but whom, methinks, you love. Let greater men sing greater themes: I speak of little things, and am content to come back often to your hands.”</p>

<p>So long as Janus shall lend winters, Domitian autumns, and Augustus summers to the years, so long as the great day of the Kalends of Germanicus shall claim the grand renown</p>
