<p class="noindent">Since you have legs that imitate the crescent moon, Phoebus, you could wash your feet in a drinking-horn.</p>

<p class="noindent">I would not want you to curl your hair, but neither would I want you to rough it up. I don’t want your skin to glisten, nor yet to be dirty. Don’t wear the beard of the turbaned crew,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL094_153_35" id="target_note_LCL094_153_35">

</a> I don’t want too much of a man, Pannychus, and I don’t want too little. As it is, your shins bristle with hairs and your chest with shag, but, Pannychus, you have a depilated mind.</p>

<p class="noindent">Whatever is served, you sweep it up from this side and that: teats of sow’s udder, rib of pork, a woodcock meant for two, half a mullet and a whole pike, side of lamprey, leg of fowl, pigeon dripping with its gravy.

I did not invite you for tomorrow, Caecilianus.</p>
