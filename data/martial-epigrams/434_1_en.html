<h3>84</h3>
<p class="noindent">Whoever does not want to go down to the Stygian shades
just yet, let him, if he is wise, shun Antiochus the barber.
With knives less cruel white arms are lacerated when
the frenzied throng<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_71_108" id="target_note_LCL480_71_108">
<sup>108</sup>
</a> raves to the sound of Phrygian music.
Alcon is more gentle when he cuts entangled hernias
or hews broken bones with his carpenter’s hand. Let
Antiochus clip pauper Cynics and Stoic chins, let him strip
horses’ necks bare of their dusty manes. Were he to shave
poor Prometheus under his Scythian crag, Prometheus
with naked breast would call for the torturer bird. Pentheus
would flee to his mother, Orpheus to the Maenads,
should they so much as hear the sound of Antiochus’ barbarous
weapons. These scars that you count on my chin,
like those that sit on the face of an elderly bruiser, none of
them were made by a tyrannical wife with angry nails: it’s
Antiochus’ steel and bloody hand. Of all animals only the
billy goat has sense: he lives with a beard lest he suffer
Antiochus.</p>

<p class="noindent">Zoilus, your tongue was struck with a sudden paralysis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL480_71_109" id="target_note_LCL480_71_109">
<sup>109</sup>

while you were licking. Surely, Zoilus, you fornicate now.</p>
