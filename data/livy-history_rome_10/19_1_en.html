cavalry, when, in wheeling his horse about after a swift gallop, he was thrown and ere long breathed his last, for the third day following the accident saw the end of the consul’s life. Taking this as an omen of the war, and declaring that the gods had begun hostilities in their behalf, the Etruscans plucked up courage. It was sad news to the Romans; not only could they ill spare the man, but his death occurred at an embarrassing moment. The Fathers would have ordered the nomination of a dictator had not the election
held to choose a substitute for the consul fallen out in accordance with the wishes of the leaders. Marcus Valerius was the choice of all the centuries for consul. It was he whom the senate had intended to have named as dictator, and they now commanded him to proceed forthwith to the legions in Etruria. His arrival so damped the ardour of the Etruscans that none ventured outside their fortifications, and their own fear was like a besieging host. Nor could the new consul entice them into giving battle by wasting their lands and firing their buildings,
though the smoke was rising on every side from the conflagration not only of farm-houses but of many villages as well.</p>
<p>While this war was prolonged beyond anticipation, another war—justly dreaded by reason of the many losses which the parties to it had inflicted on each other—was beginning to be talked of in consequence of information given by the Picentes, Rome’s new allies. The Samnites, they said, were looking to arms and a renewal of hostilities, and had solicited their help. The Picentes were thanked, and the senate’s anxiety was diverted, in great measure, from Etruria to the Samnites.</p>
