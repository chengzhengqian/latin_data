<h3><span class="ac">Summary of Book XI</span></h3>
<p><span class="sc">When</span> Fabius Gurges the consul had fought an unsuccessful battle with the Samnites and the senate was debating his removal from the command, Fabius Maximus his father begged them to spare his son this ignominy. What particularly moved the senate was his promise to go out as his son’s lieutenant, which he did. Aided by his advice and services, his son the consul defeated the Samnites and triumphed. Gaius Pontius, the general of the Samnites, was led in the triumph and beheaded. When the state was troubled with a pestilence, the envoys dispatched to bring over the image of Aesculapius from Epidaurus to Rome fetched away a serpent, which had crawled into their ship and in which it was generally believed that the god himself was present. On the serpent’s going ashore on the island of the Tiber, a temple was erected there to Aesculapius. The consular Lucius Postumius was convicted of having used the labour of soldiers on his own land when in command of the army. The Samnites sought peace and the treaty with them was renewed for the fourth time. Curius Dentatus the consul having slaughtered the Samnites and conquered the Sabines, who had revolted, and received their submission, triumphed twice in the same year of office. Colonies were established at Castrum, Sena, and Hadria. A board of three to deal with capital offences was then chosen for the first time. The number of citizens was returned as 272,000. Because of their debts, the plebs, after serious and protracted quarrels, seceded to Janiculum, whence they were brought back by Quintus Hortensius the dictator, who died before the expiration of his term. The book contains also campaigns with the Vulsinienses and likewise with the Lucanians, against whom the Romans had voted to assist the people of Thurii.</p>
