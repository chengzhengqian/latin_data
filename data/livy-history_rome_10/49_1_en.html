<p>XXVI. Fabius, when he returned to Rome, both in the senate and afterwards in speaking to the people, steered a middle course, that he might appear neither to exaggerate the current reports about the war nor minimize them, and in accepting an additional commander to be rather consulting the fears of others than guarding against a danger to himself or the republic. For the rest, if they chose to give him a helper in the war and a partner in authority, how—he asked—could he possibly forget Publius Decius the consul, whom he had proved so often when they had been colleagues? There was no one living with whom he would sooner share his commission; he should have troops enough, if Decius were with him, and his enemies would never be too numerous. But if his colleague preferred
some other arrangement, let them give him Lucius Volumnius to be his coadjutor. The decision in regard to everything was left by the people and the senate, and by his colleague himself, entirely to Fabius; and when Publius Decius had made known his readiness to set out either for Samnium or Etruria, there were such rejoicings and congratulations
that men tasted the sweets of victory in anticipation, and it seemed as though the consuls had been voted a triumph and not a war.</p>
<p>I find in some historians that Fabius and Decius set out for Etruria at the very beginning of their consulship, and they make no mention of the casting of lots for provinces or of the disputes betwixt the colleagues which I have described. On the other hand, even these disputes have not been enough
