Theirs were talents meet for the consul’s office. But shrewd and clever men, masters of the law and of eloquence, like Appius Claudius, should be had to preside over the City and the Forum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_443_1" id="target_note_LCL191_443_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and should be elected praetors to administer justice. With these transactions the day was taken up. On the following day, by the direction
of the consul, elections were held both of consuls and of praetors. Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were chosen consuls and Appius Claudius praetor—all three being absent<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_443_2" id="target_note_LCL191_443_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—and the senate passed a decree, which the people ratified, prolonging for a year the command of Lucius Volumnius.</p>
<p>XXIII. In that year were many portents, to avert which the senate decreed supplications for two days. Wine and incense were provided by the state, and the people went in throngs to offer their prayers—both men and women. The supplication was rendered memorable by a quarrel that broke out among the matrons in the chapel of Patrician Modesty, which stands in the Cattle Market, by the round temple of Hercules.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_443_3a" id="target_note_LCL191_443_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> Verginia, Aulus’s daughter, a patrician wedded to a commoner, Lucius Volumnius the consul, had been excluded by the matrons from their ceremonies, on the ground that she had married out of the patriciate. This led to a short dispute, which the hot anger of the sex soon kindled to a blaze of passionate contention.

Young brides dedicated to her their maiden’s dress, on marrying, and the mistake was favoured by the unusual circumstance that the image of Fortuna Virgo was veiled. The story preserved by Livy is an attempt to explain the epithet of Pudicitia Plebeia (§ 7).
