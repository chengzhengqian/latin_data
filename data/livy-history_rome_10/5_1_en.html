the Cilnii—a very powerful family<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_369_1" id="target_note_LCL191_369_1"><sup>1</sup></a>—because of the envy occasioned by their wealth. At the same time the Marsi forcibly resisted the confiscation of their land, where the colony of Carscoli had been planted with an enrolment of four thousand men.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_369_2" id="target_note_LCL191_369_2"><sup>2</sup></a> In view, therefore, of these tumults, Marcus Valerius Maximus was appointed dictator and named Marcus Aemilius Paulus to be his master of the horse. This I choose rather to believe than that Quintus Fabius, at his time of life and after the offices he had held, was made subordinate to Valerius; but I would not deny that the error might have originated in the surname of Maximus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_369_3" id="target_note_LCL191_369_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—Setting out with his army, the dictator overthrew the Marsi in a single battle; then shutting them up in their walled cities, he captured Milionia, Plestina, and Fresilia, in the course of a few days, and having fined the Marsi in a part of their territory, renewed the treaty with them.
