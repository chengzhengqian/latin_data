A number of noble captives, famous for their own and their fathers’ deeds, were led in the procession. Of heavy bronze there were carried past two million five hundred and thirty-three thousand pounds. This bronze had been collected, it was said, from the sale of captives. Of silver which had been taken from the cities there were eighteen hundred and thirty pounds. All the bronze and silver was placed in the Treasury, none of the booty being given to the soldiers. The ill-feeling
which this gave rise to in the plebs was increased by the gathering of a war-tax to pay the troops, since, if the consul had forgone the glory of depositing the captured money in the Treasury, the booty would then have afforded the soldiers a donative, as well as providing for their pay. Papirius dedicated the temple of Quirinus. I find no ancient authority who states that it was vowed in the hour of conflict, nor indeed could it possibly have been completed in so short a time; his father had vowed it when dictator, and the son as consul dedicated it, adorning it with the spoils of the enemy. Of these there was such a great quantity that not only were the temple and the Forum bedecked with them, but they were distributed also amongst the allies and the neighbouring colonies for the decoration of their temples and public squares. After triumphing, Papirius led his army into the country of the Vescini—a district infested by the Samnites—to pass the winter.</p>
