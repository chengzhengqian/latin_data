<p>XXI. This raid upon the Campanian countryside
had occasioned a great alarm in Rome; and just at that time, as it happened, there came news out of Etruria, that after the withdrawal of the army of Volumnius the Etruscans had been induced
to arm, that Gellius Egnatius, the Samnite general, and the Umbrians were being invited to join in the revolt, and that the Gauls were being tempted with great sums of money. Terrified by these reports, the senate ordered that a cessation of the courts should be proclaimed, and that a levy should be held of every sort of men. Not only was the oath administered to free citizens of military age, but cohorts were also formed out of older men, and freedmen were mustered into centuries. Plans were discussed for defending the City, and the supreme command was given to the praetor, Publius Sempronius. But the senators were relieved of a part of their anxiety by a dispatch from Lucius Volumnius, the consul, apprising them of the slaughter and dispersion of the army that had ravaged Campania. They accordingly voted a thanksgiving for the victory, in the consulâ€™s name, and reopened the courts, which had been closed for eighteen days. The thanksgiving was a very joyful one.</p>
