<p>In Etruria meanwhile the consul Carvilius, having  <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 293</span>made his preparations to begin with an attack on Troilum,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_539_1" id="target_note_LCL191_539_1"><sup>1</sup></a> agreed with four hundred and seventy of the wealthiest inhabitants for a large sum of money to let them go; the rest of the population and the town itself he took by assault. He then stormed five fortresses situated in positions of great strength. There he slew two thousand four hundred of the enemy, making fewer than two thousand prisoners. He also granted a year’s truce to the Faliscans—who came to him seeking peace—having stipulated for a hundred thousand of heavy bronze and the year’s pay for his soldiers. After these exploits he departed to enjoy his triumph, which, though less distinguished than his colleague’s had been for success against the Samnites, was a match for it when the Etruscan war was counted in. Of heavy bronze he lodged in the Treasury three hundred and eighty thousand pounds; with what remained he contracted for a temple to Fors Fortuna to be erected from the general’s spoils, near the temple of that goddess dedicated by King Servius Tullius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_539_2" id="target_note_LCL191_539_2"><sup>2</sup></a> while to the soldiers he apportioned from the rest of the booty one hundred and two <span class="italic">asses</span> each, and as much again to the centurions and horsemen. These allowances were all the more welcome because of the parsimony of his colleague. The consul’s popularity served to shield his lieutenant Lucius Postumius from the people. He had been indicted by Marcus Scantius, a plebeian tribune, but had escaped trial before the people—so the story ran—through
his appointment to the lieutenancy; so that it was easier to threaten him than to carry home the accusation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_539_3" id="target_note_LCL191_539_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
