old to call Camars—and putting Lucius Scipio, as propraetor, in charge of the camp, Fabius himself returned to Rome to consult about the war, either voluntarily, because he had a task in prospect that was greater than he had believed the reports to signify, or, it may be, summoned by the senate; for both accounts are vouched for. Some would have it appear that he was compelled to return by Appius Claudius the praetor, who continued to exaggerate the perils of the Etruscan war in the senate and before the people, as he had done persistently
in his dispatches. It was not enough, he said, to have one commander and one army against four nations: the danger was—whether they united to overwhelm him or campaigned separately—that one man would be incapable of meeting simultaneously
all emergencies. He himself had left on the ground two Roman legions, and less than five thousand infantry and cavalry had come with Fabius. It was his opinion that Publius Decius the consul should march at the very earliest moment to Etruria, to join his colleague, and that Lucius Volumnius should be given the command in Samnium; or, if the consul preferred to go out to his own province, that Volumnius should set out for Etruria with a regular consular army.1 The majority were moved by the praetor’s speech, but Publius Decius—so they say—advised that all be left to the free and unhampered judgment of Quintus Fabius, until Fabius should either come to Rome himself—if this were compatible with public policy—or send some one of his lieutenants, to inform the senate how great a war was on foot
