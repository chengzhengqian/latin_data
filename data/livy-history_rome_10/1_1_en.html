Servius Cornelius there was in general a respite from foreign wars. Colonies were established at Sora and Alba. Six thousand settlers were enrolled for Alba, in the Aequian country. Sora had belonged to the territory of the Volsci, but the Samnites had got possession of it; to this place were sent four thousand men. In this year also the Arpinates and Trebulani were granted citizenship. The Frusinates were mulcted in one-third of their land, because it was discovered that they had tampered with the Hernici; the ringleaders of the conspiracy, after the consuls, at the instance of the senate, had conducted an investigation, were scourged and beheaded. Nevertheless, that their year might not go by without any war whatever, the consuls made a little expedition into Umbria, because of a report that armed men issuing from a certain cave were making raids upon the farms. The soldiers carried their standards into the cave, and there in the murk received many wounds, particularly from stones that were thrown at them ; until, having found the other mouth of the cavern—for there was a way of going through it—they
heaped up faggots at both openings and set them afire. In this way about two thousand armed men perished in the cave from the smoke and heat, for they finally rushed into the very flames in their efforts to escape.</p>
