<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">stra</span><p class="lineGroup">Not bad.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">epi</span><p class="lineGroup">Now the guard has been gulled himself. Your father put<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">360</span><span class="br"></span>
the wallet onto my neck in person. He’s getting ready so
that when you arrive home you can immediately get married.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">stra</span><p class="lineGroup">There’s only one way he’ll persuade me: if Orcus takes
away the girl from me who was brought here together
with me.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">epi</span><p class="lineGroup">Now I’ve prepared the following trick. I’ll go to the
pimp’s house alone and coach him to say, if any people<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">365</span><span class="br"></span>
should come to him, that he’s received the money for
the lyre girl, that he has fifty silver minas—because two
days ago I counted the money out with my own hands for
that girlfriend of yours your father believes to be his
daughter: then the pimp will swear by his criminal head
without knowing what he’s doing, as if he’d received the<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">370</span><span class="br"></span>
money for the woman who’s now been brought along
with you.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">chae</span><p class="lineGroup">You’re up to more turns than a potter’s wheel.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">epi</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ll get some clever lyre girl now, one who can be hired for
a sesterce. She will pretend to have been bought and
trick the two old men cleverly. Apoecides will take her
with him to your father.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">stra</span><p class="lineGroup">How well prepared!</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">epi</span><p class="lineGroup">I’ll send her well rehearsed, loaded with my tricks and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">375</span><span class="br"></span>
wiles. But I’ve been talking far too much, you’ve delayed
me for too long. Now you know how this is going to happen.
I’m off.</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc">stra</span><p class="lineGroup">Have a successful journey.</p></div>
