that if the old man finds out about this, he might turn elm
rods into hangers-on to lick me to the bone. But one matter

hire some lyre girl to come here to him to his house, to
sing for him while he offers sacrifice. She’ll be hired and
shown how to trick the old man. I’ll go inside and receive
the money from the old prodigal.</p></div>
