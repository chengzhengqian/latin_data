<p class="noindent">Persuaded by his slave, an old man bought a lyre girl in the belief
that she is his daughter, and again the slave tricked him by
palming off a hired woman as his son’s girlfriend. The slave
gives the money to his master’s son. With it the young man buys
his sister without knowing it. With the help of a woman he had<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
raped and of a soldier, the old man realizes that he has been
tricked—just as the soldier was looking for his girlfriend, the
woman was looking for her daughter—but when his daughter is
discovered, he frees his slave.</p>
