<p class="noindent">For there are some who believe <span class="italic">verbum</span> [“word”] to be derived from <span class="italic">verum</span> [“true”], but, even if sufficient attention is paid to the first syllable, the second one must not be neglected. When we say <span class="italic">verbum</span>, they claim, its first syllable means “true,” its second “sound,” for this is what they want <span class="italic">bum</span> to express; whence Ennius called the sound of feet “the booming [<span class="italic">bombum</span>] of feet,” and the Greeks use “to shout” [Gk. <span class="italic">boao</span>] for “to utter a loud noise,” and Virgil [<span class="italic">G. </span>3.223] says “the woods resound [<span class="italic">reboant</span>].” Thus <span class="italic">verbum</span> has been derived from “bellowing forth the truth [<span class="italic">verum boando</span>]” as it were, that is “sounding forth the truth.”</p>
