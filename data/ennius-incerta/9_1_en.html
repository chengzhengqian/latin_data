<p class="noindent">The preposition <span class="italic">ob</span> [“in front of”] is sometimes used . . . ; sometimes it is used in place of <span class="italic">ad</span> [“toward”], as Ennius [8 <span class="italic">Ann.</span> F 18]: “he began leading his legions toward [<span class="italic">ob</span>] Rome at night,” and elsewhere “he led toward [<span class="italic">ob</span>] Troy.”</p>

Yet the Greeks themselves spoke thus, as they called women “loving words” [<span class="italic">philo-logos</span>] or “loving money” [<span class="italic">phil-argyros</span>]. But a copyist, seeing that a woman was meant, changed it . . . [<span class="italic">followed by further discussion in very corrupt form on the use of single gender nouns</span>]</p>

Festus suggests that Ennius treated <span class="italic">philologus</span> as a word that, like the Greek examples provided, was applicable to both genders, the form only later changed to provide a Latin feminine.  Ennius famously rendered <span class="italic">philologus</span> (referring to himself) as <span class="italic">dicti studiosus</span> at 7 <span class="italic">Ann.</span> F 1. It is possible, however, that <span class="italic">philologa</span> (lit., “speech lover”) in this context had nothing to do with learning but meant simply “chatterbox,” a suggestion we owe to Katharina Volk.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL537_321_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
