<p class="noindent">But since common usage accepts each of the two equally, for the entire body it prefers to use “we wash ourselves” [<span class="italic">lavamur</span>: middle-passive], for parts of the body “we wash” [<span class="italic">lavamus</span>: active], because we say “I wash my hands” and so too of feet and the rest. Therefore, with respect to baths they do not say correctly “I have washed,” but correctly “I have washed my hands.” But since in baths we say “I wash myself, I have washed myself,” it follows that, by contrast, since it is “I am accustomed,” one ought to say “I have been accustomed” [<span class="italic">solui</span>], as Cato and Ennius write, not, as people commonly say, “I have been accustomed” [<span class="italic">solitus sum</span>: different, more common form of the perfect tense, passive form with active meaning] should be said . . .</p>
