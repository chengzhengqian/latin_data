<p class="noindent">Is there really anything more similar to madness than anger? How well has Ennius called it the beginning of madness. Complexion, voice, eyes, spirit, powerlessness of words and deed, which part of sanity do they have?</p>

<p class="noindent">If Epicurus had learned how much is twice two, he surely would not speak this way; but when he judges what is best by his palate, he did not look up at “the palate of the sky,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL537_309_1" id="target_note_LCL537_309_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as Ennius says.</p>

Ennius made &lt;this&gt;.” That is surely the work of an attentive mind rather than a mad one.</p>
