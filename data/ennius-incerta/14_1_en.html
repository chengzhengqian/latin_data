<p class="noindent">“now &lt;I dare&gt; not say a word [<span class="italic">mutire</span>]”: Ennius:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">neither do I speak nor make &lt;a <span class="italic">mu</span>&gt;</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">whence we also call the mute [<span class="italic">muti</span>],—which thing [<span class="italic">muttire</span>] the Greeks call “to make a sound.”</p>

<p class="noindent">“while doing”: “when you do.” And this is a respectable expression, if we were to say, “I said this while eating.” Afranius [<span class="italic">Tog. </span>422<span class="italic"> </span>R<span class="italic">.</span><sup>2–3</sup>] says, “while speaking”; Ennius:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">while putting</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">indigno</span> [“beyond what is appropriate”]: either [in a negative sense] “relating to prostitutes” or [in a positive sense] “great”: for Ennius too says:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">towers beyond what is appropriate</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">that is, great.</p>

<p class="noindent">“stored deep in the mind”: “secret,” “hidden.” Moreover, “stored” [<span class="italic">repostum</span>] is a syncope, for he took one syllable away from the middle [<span class="italic">repositum</span>]. But since all utterances are either unaltered or have some modification, those that have a modification must be rendered in the shape in which they were collected, which Maro [Virgil] certainly did. For “stored” [<span class="italic">Aen. </span>6.655] and “stretch out” [<span class="italic">Aen. </span>8.274] he took over from Ennius: moreover, we use both these unaltered and others on the model of these.</p>
