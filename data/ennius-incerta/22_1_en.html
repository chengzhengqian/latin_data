<p class="noindent">That <span class="italic">daedalus</span> [“skillful”], from the variety of things and works of art, is said of the earth in Lucretius [1.7; 1.228: <span class="italic">daedala tellus</span>], of Minerva in Ennius, of Circe in Virgil [<span class="italic">Aen.</span> 7.282; cf. Serv. ad Verg. <span class="italic">G.</span> 4.179] is easy to understand, since the Greeks have <span class="italic">daidallein</span> [“to embellish skillfully”] meaning “to give variety to.”</p>
