mad passion for Inachia. Oh dear! I’m ashamed of such a disgraceful business—what a source of gossip I was throughout the city! I hate to recall those parties at which my listlessness and silence and the sighs fetched from the depths of my heart betrayed the man in love. “To think that a poor man’s genuine qualities are powerless against money!”—that was the complaint I would make to you in tears, when I was becoming heated with a fiery wine, and the shameless god drew out my secrets from their hiding place. “But if a liberating rage boiled up in my heart, enabling me to scatter to the winds these thankless remedies that do nothing to heal my wound, my shame would be banished and I would no longer compete with people who are not my equals!” When I had sternly commended this course of action in your presence, you urged me to go home. Instead I made my way with faltering steps to the door that was, alas, utterly unsympathetic, and the threshold that was, alas, so hard that I bruised my hips and pelvis against it to no avail. Now I am enthralled by my passion for Lyciscus, who prides himself on being more softly compliant than any slip of a woman. Neither the frank advice of my friends nor their stern condemnation is able to rescue me. That can be done only by another flame—either a pretty girl or a well-formed boy who ties back his long hair in a knot.</p>
