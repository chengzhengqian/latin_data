<p>All of you, or at least the better part, may be considering what the right course is, in our efforts to be rid of these woeful sufferings. Let this be our preferred decision (following the precedent of the Phocaean community<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_309_27" id="target_note_LCL033_309_27"><sup>27</sup></a> which, after swearing a solemn oath, abandoned their lands and ancestral gods, leaving their shrines to be occupied by boars and savage wolves): to go wherever our legs will carry us, wherever the South Wind or the wild Southwester summon us over the waves. Is that your decision? Or does anyone have a better proposal? The omens are favourable; so why don’t we go on board at once? But let us swear this oath: when rocks float up to the surface from the sea’s bed, only then will it be no sin to return. Let us not be loth to put about and sail home, when the Po washes the Matine hilltops or the towering Apennines run into the sea, when a strange affection causes unnatural unions in an unheard-of lust, making tigers eager to couple with deer, and the dove take the kite as a lover; when cattle become trustful, losing their fear of tawny lions, and the goat, no longer shaggy, happily takes to the salt sea. After swearing these oaths and any others that will cut off the prospect of a sweet return, let us be off—the whole community, or at least that part which is superior to the unteachable masses. Leave the timid and the hopeless to lie forever in their beds of doom!</p>
<p>You who have not lost your manhood—away with womanly wailing, and flypast the Etruscan shore. The all-encompassing ocean awaits us. Let us steer for the fields, the blessed fields, and those rich isles where the earth yields corn every year without tilling,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_309_28" id="target_note_LCL033_309_28"><sup>28</sup></a> and the vine
