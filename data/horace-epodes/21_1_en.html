flowers without pruning, where the olive branch never fails to bud, and the dark fig adorns its native tree, where honey oozes from the hollow oak, and the water comes leaping lightly down from the high hills with splashing feet. There the goats come uncalled to the milking pail, and the friendly flock brings home its bulging udders. In the evening no bear comes growling around the sheepfold, nor does the ground swell high with vipers. And we, lucky people that we are, will have still more to marvel at: how there is no wet East Wind to scour the ploughed land with its drenching showers; nor are the fertile seeds scorched in the dry soil; for the king of the gods moderates each extreme. No infections harm the livestock, and the flocks do not swelter under the merciless heat of any star.The craft of pine never strove to reach here, rowed by the Argo’s crew; the shameless Colchian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL033_311_29" id="target_note_LCL033_311_29"><sup>29</sup></a> never set foot here; no sailors of Sidon turned their yardarms in this direction, nor did Ulysses’ toiling comrades. No plague infects the herd, no star’s furious heat scorches the flock. Jove set these shores apart for the righteous race when he debased the golden age with bronze.
