back to me. Your affections will return, but not because they have been summoned by Marsian incantations. I shall prepare something stronger; I shall brew something stronger to deal with your scorn. The sky shall sink beneath the sea with the earth spread out above it before you escape burning with passion for me as pitch burns with its smoky flame.”</p>
<p>At this the boy, no longer hoping as before to soften those unholy hags with pathetic appeals, but unsure how to break his silence, finally hurled curses worthy of Thyestes: “Magic poisons have no power to alter right and wrong or to change the vengeance that overtakes men. I shall pursue you with curses; no sacrificial victim can bring release from a terrible malediction. More than that, when I have been forced to die and have breathed my last, I shall haunt you by night as a Fury; my ghost will attack your faces with its hooklike claws—such a power belongs to the spirits of the dead; and I shall squat on your tormented heart, banishing sleep and bringing you terror. In every street, from every side, the crowd will pelt you with stones until they have battered you to death, you filthy hags. Then the wolves and vultures of the Esquiline will scatter your unburied limbs, and my parents, who will, alas, outlive me, will not fail to relish that sight.”</p>
