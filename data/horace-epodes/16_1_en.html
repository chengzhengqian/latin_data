I’m not a hard young man, nor do I have an insensitive nose; for whether it’s a stinking cuttlefish or a goat that lurks in your hairy armpits, I can smell it out more keenly than a sharp-scented hound detects where a female boar is hiding.”What a sweat and what a nasty smell comes from her withered limbs when, finding my penis limp, she presses on to satisfy her wild lust, her chalk make-up grows damp, and, along with the rosy colour produced from crocodiles’ dung, begins to run, and now in her animal heat she breaks the thongs of the bedstead and its canopy! Or again, castigating me for my distaste in cruel words, she says “You’re not so feeble with Inachia as you are with me. You can manage her three times a night; with me you’re too limp for a single session. Damn that woman Lesbia who, when I was looking for a bull, directed me to a passive creature like yourself! And all the time I could have had Amyntus of Cos, whose sinewy member stands more firmly in his tireless crotch than a young tree on the hillside. For whose sake did I send so urgently for those woolly fleeces, double-dyed in Tyrian crimson? For you, of course, so that at parties among your age-mates there might be none whose woman loved him more than I loved you. Oh, I’m so miserable! You run away from me like a lamb frightened by fierce wolves, or a roe deer by lions!”</p>
