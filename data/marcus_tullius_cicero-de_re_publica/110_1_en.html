<h2>Book IV</h2>
<p>The Vatican manuscript contains only two short passages from this book, sections 2â€“3 and section 4. The order of the other fragments printed here is of course uncertain.</p>
<p>The social classification of citizens, the maintenance of high moral standards in the State, the physical and mental training of the young, and the influence of drama, lyric poetry, and music, are evidently among the subjects discussed.</p>
<p>I. . . . . and the same mind that foresees the
future also remembers the past. . . .</p>
<p>. . . . And indeed, if there is no one who would not prefer death to transformation into an animal of any sort, even if he could retain the mind of a man, how much more wretched is it to have the mind of a beast while retaining human form! As much more so, in my opinion, as the mind is superior to the body. . . .</p>
<p>. . . . he does not think the good of a ram and the good of Publius Africanus are the same. . . .</p>
<p>. . . . and the same body, by its interposition, makes darkness and night, useful both for the reckoning of the days and for rest from labour. . . .</p>
<p>. . . . and when in the autumn the earth has opened to receive the seed of her produce, in winter has rested so that she may [transform] this seed, and in the maturity of summer has softened some and parched others. . . .</p>
