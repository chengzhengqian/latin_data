But just as the sailor, when the sea suddenly grows rough, and the invalid when his illness becomes severe, both implore the assistance of one man, so our people, that in times of peace and while engaged at home wield authority, threaten even their magistrates, refuse to obey them, and appeal from one to another or to the people, yet in time of war yield obedience to their rulers as to a king; for safety prevails over caprice.

And this man’s title shows the character of his power; for though he is commonly called “dictator” from the fact that he is “named,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_95_1" id="target_note_LCL213_95_1"><sup>1</sup></a> yet you know, Laelius, that in our books<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_95_2" id="target_note_LCL213_95_2"><sup>2</sup></a> he is called “master of the people.”</p></div>
