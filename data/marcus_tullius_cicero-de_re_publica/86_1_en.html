certain harmony of the different tones must be preserved, the interruption or violation of which is intolerable to trained ears, and as this perfect agreement and harmony is produced by the proportionate blending of unlike tones, so also is a State made harmonious by agreement among dissimilar elements, brought about by a fair and reasonable blending together of the upper, middle, and lower classes, just as if they were musical tones. What the musicians call harmony in song is concord in a State, the strongest and best bond of permanent union in any commonwealth; and such concord can never be brought about without the aid of justice.</p></div>

Dei</span> II, 21), when Scipio had spoken further of the importance of justice in a State and the unfortunate results of its absence, Philus asked that this question he considered more fully, and that justice be taken up at greater length, because it was a common opinion that the government of a State cannot be carried on without injustice.</p>

<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">Scipio.</span></span> I agree with you, and wish to assure you that we must consider all the statements we have made so far about the commonwealth as amounting to nothing, and must admit that we have no basis whatever for further progress, unless we can not merely disprove the contention that a government cannot be carried on without injustice, but are also able to prove positively that it cannot be carried on without the strictest justice. However, with your permission, we shall go no further to-day, but shall put off what remains (for that is a considerable amount) until to-morrow.</p></div>
<p>This proposal being agreed to, they made an end of the conversation for that day.</p>
