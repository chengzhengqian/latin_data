<p>XXXVIII. <span class="italic">Laelius.</span> I see that you are plentifully supplied with witnesses, Scipio, but to me, as to any good judge, demonstrations are more convincing than the testimony of witnesses.</p>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> Then, Laelius, make use of an argument from your own feelings.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> What feelings are those?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> Those which you have experienced in case, by any chance, you have ever been conscious of being angry with anyone.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> I have been in that state, and oftener than I could wish.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> Well, when you are angry, do you allow your anger to rule your mind?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> Certainly not, but I imitate the famous Archytas of Tarentum, who, when he found, upon arriving at his country place, that all his orders had been disobeyed, said to his superintendent:’ “You are at fault, wretched man, and I should have had you flogged to death ere this were I not angry!”</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> Excellent! Then Archytas clearly regarded anger, when it disagreed with calm judgment, as a sort of rebellion within the mind, which he desired should be put down by reason.’ Take as further examples avarice, greed for power and glory, and the passions; you see, if there is any kingly power in the minds of men, it must be the domination of a single element, and this is reason (for that is the best part of the mind), and, if reason holds dominion, there is no room for the passions, for anger, for rash action.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> That is true.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> Well then, does a mind so governed meet with your approval?</p></div>
