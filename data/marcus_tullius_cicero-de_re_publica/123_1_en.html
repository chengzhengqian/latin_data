<h2><span class="ac">The Republic</span></h2>
<h2>Book VI</h2>
<p>The Vatican manuscript has preserved no part of this book. But in addition to the scattered fragments printed below, the famous <span class="italic">Dream of Scipio</span> has been handed down to us by Macrobius, in connection with his commentary upon it.</p>
<p>The lost portion of the book was evidently devoted to further discussion of the qualities and duties of the statesman, and of the value and reward of his labours.</p>
<p>I. . . . <span class="sc">What</span> you look for, then, is an account of this ruling statesmanâ€™s prudence in its entirety, a quality which derives its name from foreseeing . . .<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_257_1" id="target_note_LCL213_257_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>. . . Wherefore this citizen must see to it that he is always armed against those influences which disturb the stability of the State. . . .</p>
<p>. . . and such a dissension among the citizens, in which one party separates from the rest, is called sedition . .<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_257_2" id="target_note_LCL213_257_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>. . . And indeed in civil strife, when virtue is of greater importance than numbers, I think the citizens ought to be weighed rather than counted . . .</p>
<p>. . . For our desires are hard masters over our thoughts, compelling and commanding us to do an infinite number of things; and as these desires can never be appeased or satisfied in any way, they urge to every sort of crime those whom they have inflamed by their allurements.</p>
<p>. . . who has restrained its power and that unbridled ferocity. . . .</p>
