not need to go far for an example: during my consulship, with you as my advisers, I had under consideration the treaty with Numantia. Who was not aware that Quintus Pompeius had made a treaty and that Mancinus was in the same situation? But the latter, an excellent man, went so far as to favour the bill which I proposed in accordance with a resolution of the senate, while the former defended himself with energy. If we are seeking modesty, probity, and honour, these qualities belong to Mancinus; but if we look for reason, wisdom, and prudence, then Pompeius is superior.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_209_1" id="target_note_LCL213_209_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The rest of Philus’ report of the defence of injustice made by Carneades is lost, but we are given some idea of its contents by Lactantius (<span class="italic">Inst. Div.</span> V, 16, 5–13). Toward the end he seems to have turned to men’s personal relations for further proofs that justice is equivalent to folly, and to have given, among others, the following illustrations:</p>
<p>If a man knows of serious faults in something he has for sale and reveals them to a prospective purchaser, he is a just man but a fool; if he conceals them, he is unjust, but wise! Similarly if there is a shipwreck, and two men are clutching a plank which can support only one, what is the stronger of the two to do? If he lets go, he will be a just man and he will drown! If he is wise, he will be unjust and send the other man to his death.</p>
<p>Only the following fragments (sections 32–41) of the reply of Laelius remain, but some further information about its contents can be obtained from Cicero’s own references to it in other works. See <span class="italic">De Fin,</span> 18, 59; <span class="italic">Ep. ad. Att.</span> X, 4, 4; VII, 2, 4.</p>
<p>XXI. . . . I should not hesitate, Laelius, if I did not think that our friends here desired exactly what I am eager for myself, namely, that you should take some part in our discussion, especially since you told us yesterday that you would talk at even too great length. But that indeed is impossible; we all beg you not to fail us. . . .</p>
