When he had discussed the subject and given the explanation of the phenomenon, the people were freed of their fears. For at that time it was a strange and unfamiliar idea that the sun was regularly eclipsed by the interposition of the moon—a fact which Thales of Miletus is said to have been the first to observe. But later even our own Ennius was not ignorant of it, for he wrote that, in about the three hundred and fiftieth year<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_47_1" id="target_note_LCL213_47_1"><sup>1</sup></a> after Rome was founded:</p>

For even though, during the darkness of that eclipse, Nature carried Romulus away to man’s inevitable end, yet the story is that it was his merit that caused his translation to heaven.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_47_4" id="target_note_LCL213_47_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
