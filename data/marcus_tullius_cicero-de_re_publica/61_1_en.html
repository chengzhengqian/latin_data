Then that body of leading men with great wisdom devised a plan which was entirely new and had never been heard of in any other Stateâ€”the interregnum.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_133_1" id="target_note_LCL213_133_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Their purpose was that, until a permanent king was chosen, the State should neither be without a king nor yet subject to any one king who should hold office for a long time; and that the State should not be put into such a position that any man, growing accustomed to power, might become either too reluctant to lay aside the royal prerogative or too well intrenched for holding it. For even at that period the new nation perceived a fact that had escaped the Spartan Lycurgus; for it was his thought that the king should be, not one freely chosen (assuming that the power of Lycurgus could have extended as far as that), but one retained in power, whatever sort of man he might chance to be, if he were but the offspring of the stock of Hercules.

When he arrived, although the people had already chosen him king in the assembly of the curiae, he nevertheless of his own accord caused another curiate law to be passed confirming him in his royal authority. And seeing that, as a result of their mode of life under Romulus, the Romans were filled with ardour for the pursuit of war, he thought it best to discourage that propensity to some slight extent.</p>
