<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">Laelius.</span></span> We do indeed perceive this, and also that you on your part have entered upon a new style of discussion, one that is nowhere employed in the writings of the Greeks. For that eminent Greek,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_131_1" id="target_note_LCL213_131_1"><sup>1</sup></a> whose works have never been surpassed, began with the assumption of an unoccupied tract of land, so that he might build a State upon it to suit himself. His State may perhaps be an excellent one, but it is quite unsuited to men’s actual lives and habits. His successors<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_131_2" id="target_note_LCL213_131_2"><sup>2</sup></a> have discussed the different types of State and their basic principles without presenting any definite example or model. But you, I infer, mean to combine these two methods; for you have approached your subject as if you preferred to give the credit for your own discoveries to others rather than, following the example of Socrates in Plato’s work, to invent a new State yourself; and in what you have said about the site of your State you are referring to a definite principle the things done by Romulus either by chance or necessity; and, in the third place your discussion does not wander about, but confines itself to a single State. Therefore continue as you have begun, for I think I can foresee, as you follow the reigns of the succeeding kings, the State’s progress toward perfection.</p></div>
<p>XII. <span class="italic">Scipio.</span> Well, then, when the senate of Romulus, which consisted of the most eminent men, and had been so much favoured by the king that he desired its members to be called “Fathers” and their children “patricians”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_131_3" id="target_note_LCL213_131_3"><sup>3</sup></a>—when this senate attempted, after the death of Romulus, to rule the State by itself, dispensing with a king, the people would not tolerate it, but, in their affectionate longing for Romulus, continually thereafter demanded a king.
