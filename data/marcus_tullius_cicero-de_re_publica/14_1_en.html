<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> Do you really think then, Philus, that we have already acquired a perfect knowledge of those matters that relate to our own homes and to the State, since we are now seeking to learn what is going on in the heavens?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Philus.</span></span> Do you not think it important for our homes that we should know what is happening and being done in that home which is not shut in by the walls we build, but is the whole universe, a home and a fatherland which the gods have given us the privilege of sharing with them? Surely it is important, especially since, if we are ignorant of these matters, we must remain ignorant of many other important things. Besides, the mere learning about the facts of nature and their investigation gives me at least the greatest pleasure, as it certainly must to you also, Laelius, and to all who are eager for wisdom.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> I have no objection to the topic, especially as this is a holiday. But are we to hear some discussion of it, or have we come too late?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Philus.</span></span> There has been no discussion as yet, and, since we have not begun, I should be pleased to yield to you, Laelius, so that you may give us your opinion on the subject.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> On the contrary, let us hear yours, unless perhaps Manilius thinks that a provisional edict ought to be issued embodying a compromise between the two suns, whereby “they shall have and hold the sky in such manner that they shall both in common have and hold it.”</p></div>
