<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> Nothing could be better.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> In that case you would not approve if reason should be dethroned, and our innumerable passions, or our anger, should obtain complete domination?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> I can think of nothing more wretched than such a mind, or than the man that possesses it.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> Then you think that the mind should be a kingdom, all of whose parts are to be ruled by reason?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius</span></span> I certainly do.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> How then can you be doubtful as to your conclusion about the State? For if the management of a State is committed to more than one, you can see that there will be no authority at all to take command, for unless such authority is a unit, it can amount to nothing.</p></div>
<p>XXXIX. <span class="italic">Laelius.</span> But let me ask what difference there is between one and many, if the many possess justice.</p>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> As I realize that no great impression has been made upon you by my witnesses, I shall continue using you as my witness in order to prove what I say.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> Me? In what way?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> A short time ago, when we were at your place at Formiae, I noticed that you gave your people emphatic orders to obey the directions of one person only.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> Certainly; my superintendent, of course.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> How about your residence in the city? Are several persons in charge there?</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Laelius.</span></span> Of course not; only one.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> And no one else but yourself rules your whole household?</p></div>
