before you, nor anything that I have thought out or discovered by myself. For I remember an incident in the life of Gaius Sulpicius Gallus, a most learned man, as you know: at a time when a similar phenomenon was reported, and he happened to be at the house of Marcus Marcellus, his colleague in the consulship,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_41_1" id="target_note_LCL213_41_1"><sup>1</sup></a> he ordered the celestial globe to be brought out which the grandfather of Marcellus had carried off from Syracuse, when that very rich and beautiful city was taken,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_41_2" id="target_note_LCL213_41_2"><sup>2</sup></a> though he took home with him nothing else out of the great store of booty captured.
