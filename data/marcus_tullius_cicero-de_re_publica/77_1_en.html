for the name. Another manifestation of the same spirit was the institution by Publius Valerius of the custom of ordering the rods<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_165_1" id="target_note_LCL213_165_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to be lowered when he began to speak before the people; also the fact that he moved the site of his house to the foot of the Velian Hill when he noticed that popular suspicion was aroused because he had begun to build on the very spot on the top of that hill where King Tullius had resided. It was the same man who, by an act whereby he shows himself in the highest sense “the people’s friend,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_165_2" id="target_note_LCL213_165_2"><sup>2</sup></a> proposed to the citizens that first law passed by the centuriate assembly, which forbade any magistrate to execute or scourge a Roman citizen in the face of an appeal. The records of the pontiffs, however, state that the right of appeal, even against a king’s sentence, had been previously recognized, and our augural books confirm the statement. Besides, many laws of the Twelve Tables<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_165_3" id="target_note_LCL213_165_3"><sup>3</sup></a> show that an appeal from any judgment or sentence was allowed; and the tradition that the decemvirs who wrote the laws were elected with the provision that there should be no appeal from their decision shows clearly enough that other officials were subject to this right of appeal. And a law proposed by the consuls Lucius Valerius Potitus and Marcus Horatius Barbatus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_165_4" id="target_note_LCL213_165_4"><sup>4</sup></a> men who wisely favoured popular measures to preserve peace, provides that no magistrate not subject to appeal shall be elected. Nor indeed did the Porcian laws,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_165_5" id="target_note_LCL213_165_5"><sup>5</sup></a> which, as you know, are three in number and were proposed by three different members of the Porcian family, add anything new to previous statutes except the provision of a penalty for violations.</p>
