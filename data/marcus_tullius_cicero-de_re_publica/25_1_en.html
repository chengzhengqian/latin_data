my parents and ancestors as my sole task, have to confess that I am more slothful than any craftsman, if I have devoted less labour to the supreme craft than they to their humble tasks? But I am not satisfied with the works dealing with this subject which the greatest and wisest men of Greece have left us;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_61_1" id="target_note_LCL213_61_1"><sup>1</sup></a> nor on the other hand am I bold enough to rate my opinion above theirs. Therefore I ask you to listen to me as to one who is neither entirely ignorant of the Greek authorities, nor, on the other hand, prefers their views, particularly on this subject, to our own, but rather as to a Roman who, though provided by a father’s care with a liberal education and eager for knowledge from boyhood, yet has been trained by experience and the maxims learned at home much more than by books.</p>
<p>XXIII. <span class="italic">Philus.</span> By Hercules, I am confident, Scipio, that no one is your superior in innate ability, and that your experience in the highest spheres of government is absolutely unsurpassed; we are also aware to what studies you have always devoted yourself. Wherefore if, as you say, you have also devoted your attention to this science, or craft, as it may be called, I am very grateful to Laelius; for I hope that what you tell us will be far more profitable than anything contained in the treatises of the Greeks.</p>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> You are setting very great expectations on what I shall say—a heavy burden to one who is about to discuss matters of such importance.</p></div>
<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Philus.</span></span> However great our expectations may be, you will still surpass them as usual; for there is no danger that you will lack eloquence in discussing such a topic as the State.</p></div>
