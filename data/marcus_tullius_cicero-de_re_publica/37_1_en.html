<div class="sp inline"><p class="lineGroup"><span class="speaker"><span class="italic">&gt;Scipio.</span></span> Why do you imagine, except for the reason that lies before your eyes? It may be that the rulers of States have introduced, for its usefulness in practical life, the belief that there is one king in heaven, who moves all Olympus with a nod, as Homer says,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_85_1a" id="target_note_LCL213_85_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> and is both king and father of all; in that case we have an excellent precedent and the testimony of many witnesses—if all can be called “many”—to the fact that the nations have agreed (to wit, by the decisions of their rulers) that nothing is better than a king, since, as they believe, all the gods are ruled by the authority of one.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL213_85_2" id="target_note_LCL213_85_2"><sup>2</sup></a> But if, on the other hand, we have become convinced that these beliefs have their origin in the false ideas of the ignorant and are to be classed as fables, then let us listen to those who may be called the teachers of educated men, to those who, as we may say, have seen with their own eyes things of which we hardly get an inkling through our ears.</p></div>
