by outward application, the health of souls is comprised within themselves. But the greater and more divine their superiority, the greater their need of assiduous care. And so reason if well employed sees clearly what is best; if left neglected it is entangled in a multitude of deceptions. To your case therefore I must now wholly direct the course of my remarks. For you pretend to be inquiring about the wise man; maybe, however, you are inquiring about yourself. The means then of attending to the disorders I have enumerated are varied. For not every distress is assuaged by one method; for there is one remedy to be applied to the mourner, another to the compassionate or envious. There is too in dealing with all four disorders<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_395_1" id="target_note_LCL141_395_1"><sup>1</sup></a> this difference to be considered, whether our remarks<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_395_2" id="target_note_LCL141_395_2"><sup>2</sup></a> are better addressed to disorder in general, which is contempt of reason or longing of a more violent kind, or to the separate disorders, as for instance, of fear, lust, and the rest; and whether the special cause of the distress which is felt, is to be held undeserving of distress, or whether distress arising from every cause is to be wholly removed; for instance, supposing anyone were distressed at being poor, the question is whether you should argue that poverty is not an evil, or that a human being should not be distressed at anything. Beyond doubt this latter course is better, for fear the sufferer should have to give way to distress, supposing one should fail to convince him about poverty; whereas, once distress is removed by the appropriate reasoning we made use of yesterday,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_395_3" id="target_note_LCL141_395_3"><sup>3</sup></a> in a certain way<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_395_4" id="target_note_LCL141_395_4"><sup>4</sup></a> the evil of poverty is also removed.</p>
