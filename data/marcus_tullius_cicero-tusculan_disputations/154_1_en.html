learn over and over again? And yet though they realize that they are stuck fast in a slough of folly, and nothing is worse than this, they are not overcome with distress. For their thoughts are not coloured by the idea of a grief that duty requires. What of those who do not think that men should show their grief? Men like Q. Maximus carrying to the grave a son of consular rank, like L. Paullus who lost two sons within a few days, like M. Cato<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_309_1" id="target_note_LCL141_309_1"><sup>1</sup></a> on the death of a son who was praetor elect, like the other examples I have brought together in my <span class="italic">Consolation</span>. What else was it made them tranquil except the thought that sorrow and mourning were unbefitting in a man? Therefore, where others are accustomed to surrender themselves to distress in the belief that it is right, these men spurned distress in the thought that it was degrading. From this it is understood that distress is not natural but a matter of belief.</p>
<p>XXIX. In opposition to this view it is urged: Who is so mad as to mourn of his own free choice? It is nature that causes grief, and your Crantor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_309_2" id="target_note_LCL141_309_2"><sup>2</sup></a> they say, thinks that we must give way to it. For its attack is pressed home and cannot be resisted. And so the hero Oïleus in Sophocles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_309_3" id="target_note_LCL141_309_3"><sup>3</sup></a> though he had previously consoled Telamon for the death of Ajax, yet broke down when he heard of his own son’s death. His change of mind is thus described:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">And there is none of wisdom so possessed,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Who with mild words has soothed another’s woes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But does not, when a turn of fortune comes,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Fall broken by his own calamity;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">So words, for others wise, his own need fail.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
