childhood such a number of important ideas, innate and as it were impressed <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_69_1" id="target_note_LCL141_69_1"><sup>1</sup></a> on our souls and called ἔννοιαι,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_69_2" id="target_note_LCL141_69_2"><sup>2</sup></a> unless the soul, before it had entered the body, had been active in acquiring knowledge. And since there is no true existence in any sensible object, as Plato everywhere argues—for he thinks that nothing that has a beginning and an ending exists, and only that exists which is always constant to its nature; this he calls ἰδέα and we “idea”—the soul in the prison-house of the body could not have apprehended ideas; it brought the knowledge with it: consequently our feeling of wonder at the extent of our knowledge is removed. Yet the soul, when suddenly shifted into such an unaccustomed and disordered dwelling-place, does not clearly see ideas, but when it has composed and recovered itself it apprehends them by remembrance. Thus, according to Plato, learning is nothing but recollecting.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_69_3a" id="target_note_LCL141_69_3a"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>But for my part I wonder at memory<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_69_4" id="target_note_LCL141_69_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in a still greater degree. For what is it that enables us to remember, or what character has it, or what is its origin? I am not inquiring into the powers of memory which, it is said, Simonides possessed, or

Absolute justice, beauty, goodness, etc., are “ἰδέαι,” and knowledge of them cannot be obtained through the senses. These “ideas” are unchanging, are always what they are and do not admit of variation. We acquired knowledge of them before we were born. Objects perceived by the senses are always changing and hardly ever the same. The soul is akin to the invisible and unchanging: the body to the visible and changing. The body drags the soul into the region of the visible and changing, and the soul wanders and is confused. We make the nearest approach to knowledge when we have the least possible connection or fellowship with the body. If the soul had had no life apart from its association with the body, it could not have acquired knowledge of the true realities, the “ideas.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL141_69_3a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL141_69_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL141_69_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>Cicero here leaves the Platonic doctrine of the recollection by the soul of knowledge acquired before it entered the body, and considers the powers of memory by which we retain the knowledge of things we learn in this life, and which he seems to think more wonderful than Plato’s ἀνάμνησις.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL141_69_4').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
