<span class="italic">women, stubbornness, love of good living, intoxication, daintiness</span> and anything similar. Avarice again is an intense belief, persistent and deeply rooted, which regards money as being eminently desirable, and the definition of the other members of the same class is similar. The definitions of <span class="italic">aversions</span> moreover are of the type that <span class="italic">inhospitality</span> is an intense belief, persistent and deeply rooted, that a visitor is to be carefully avoided; a similar definition too is given of <span class="italic">hatred of women</span> like that of Hippolytus, and <span class="italic">hatred of mankind</span> like that of Timon.</p>
<p>XII. Now to come to the analogy of health and to make use at last of this comparison (but more sparingly than is the way of the Stoics), as some men are more prone to some diseases and other men to others, and so we say of certain people that they are liable to catch cold, certain others to attacks of colic, not because they are suffering at the moment but because they frequently do so; in the same way some men are prone to fear, others to another disorder, in consequence of which in some cases we speak of an <span class="italic">anxious temper</span> and hence of anxious people, in other cases of <span class="italic">irascibility</span> which is different from <span class="italic">anger</span>, and it is one thing to be irascible, another thing to be angry, just as an <span class="italic">anxious temper</span> is different from <span class="italic">feeling anxiety;</span> for not all men who are at times anxious are of an anxious temper, nor are those who have an anxious temper always feeling anxious, just as for instance there is a difference between intoxication and habitual drunkenness, and it is one thing to be a gallant and another thing to be in love. Moreover this proneness of some men to one disease and others to another is of wide application; for it applies to all disorders.
