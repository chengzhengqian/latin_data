death does not appertain either to the living or to the dead? The dead do not exist, the living it will not touch.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_111_1" id="target_note_LCL141_111_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Those who minimize it are for making it closely resemble sleep:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_111_2" id="target_note_LCL141_111_2"><sup>2</sup></a> just as if anyone would wish to live for ninety years on condition of sleeping the remainder after he had completed sixty. Even his family would not wish it, apart from the man’s own wishes. Endymion, if we are inclined to listen to fairy-tales, once upon a time fell asleep on Latmus, a mountain in Caria, and has not yet awoke I fancy. You do not think then that he is anxious over the worries<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_111_3a" id="target_note_LCL141_111_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> of the moon, by whom it is thought he was lulled to sleep, that she might kiss him in his slumber. Nay, why should he be anxious who has not so much as the power of sensation? You have sleep, death’s counterfeit, and this you daily put on like a garment, and you doubt the fact of there being no sensation in death, though you see that in its counterfeit there is no sensation?</p>
<p>XXXIX. Let such follies then as thinking that it is wretched to die before our time be pushed aside as old wives’ fables, which they pretty nearly are. What “time,” pray? Nature’s? Why, she it is who has granted the use of life like a loan, without fixing any day for repayment. What is there then for you to complain of, if she calls it in when she will? Those were the terms on which you had accepted the loan. The same grumblers think that if a small child dies, the loss must be borne calmly; if an infant in the cradle, there must not even be a lament. And yet in this latter case nature has called in her gift with greater cruelty.
