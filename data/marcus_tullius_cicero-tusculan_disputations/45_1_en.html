O it does, for there are those here who are not satisfied with our conclusions; however, in this discussion of ours I shall never let you go with the possibility of your thinking on any ground that death is an evil. A. How can it be, seeing I have recognized the truth of what you say? M. How can it, do you ask? Crowds of opponents are coming, not merely Epicureans—whom for my part I do not despise, though somehow or other to my regret all the best philosophers are contemptuous of them—but my favourite Dicaearchus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_91_2" id="target_note_LCL141_91_2"><sup>2</sup></a> has argued most incisively against the immortality of the soul.

Let us therefore be armed in case we find ourselves in such a plight. A. Quite so, but I shall take care we do not. M. Is there any reason then to stop us from sending our friends the Stoics about their business? I mean those who say that souls survive on their departure from the body, but not for ever? A.
