“The infant had not yet tasted the sweetness of life,” they say: “but the other was already forming high hopes, which he was beginning to enjoy.” But in all other matters this is counted better—to get a part rather than nothing: why otherwise in life? And yet it is no bad saying of Callimachus that “Priam had shed tears far more often than Troilus.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_113_1" id="target_note_LCL141_113_1"><sup>1</sup></a> On the other hand, the lot of those who die at the close of their prime is applauded. Why should it be? I imagine to no men could a longer life, if it were granted them, prove more agreeable.
