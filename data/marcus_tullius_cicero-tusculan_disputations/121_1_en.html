afraid of the menace of their approach. So it comes that distress is incompatible with fortitude. It is therefore probable that the man who is susceptible of distress is also susceptible of fear, and indeed of dejection and depression of soul. Where men are susceptible of these emotions there also comes a feeling of subjection, a readiness to admit themselves beaten should occasion arise. He who makes this admission has to admit fear and cowardice as well. But of such feelings the brave man is not susceptible: therefore he is not susceptible of distress either. But no one is wise if he is not brave. Therefore the wise man will not be susceptible of distress. Moreover the brave man must also be high-souled, and the high-souled must be unconquered; and the unconquered must look down on human vicissitudes and consider them beneath him. But no one can look down upon the things which can make him suffer distress. And from this it follows that the brave man never suffers distress. But all wise men are brave. Therefore the wise man is not susceptible of distress. And just as the eye, if out of order, is not in a right condition for discharging its function, and the other members, or the body as a whole, if it is not in its normal condition, fails to perform its function and work: similarly the soul, if disquieted, is not fitted to carry out its work. But the work of the soul is the right use of reason, and the soul of the wise man is always in a condition to make the best use of reason. Therefore it is never in a disordered state. But distress is a disorder of the soul. Therefore the wise man will always be free from it.</p>
