<p>XII. A. Show clearly, then, if it is not troublesome, in the first place, if you can, that souls survive after death, and next, if you fail to establish this—for it is a difficult matter—you are to prove that death is free from any evil. For the point I am afraid of is precisely this, namely that it be found an evil, I do not say to be without sensation, but to have to face the prospect of being without it. M. As for authorities for that view which you wish to see established, we can employ the highest, a point which in all cases ought to have great weight and usually does so: and, to begin with, we can quote all antiquity which, it may be, had a clearer vision of the truth in proportion to its nearness to its origin and divine ancestry. Accordingly we find in those men of old whom Ennius styled the “ancients”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_33_1" id="target_note_LCL141_33_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the fixed belief that there is sensation in the state of death, and that in quitting life man is not annihilated so as to perish utterly; this may be gathered, among many other instances, from pontifical law and the rites of burial, for these rites would not have been so scrupulously observed by men of commanding ability and their profanation forbidden under penalty of guilt admitting of no atonement, if there had not been a fixed conviction in their minds that death was not annihilation obliterating and destroying all things, but a kind of shifting and changing of life which often served as a guide to heaven for illustrious men and women, while for all others the ghostly life was kept underground, yet all the same survived.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_33_2a" id="target_note_LCL141_33_2a"><sup>2</sup></a>
