condition of the soul is discernible when there is no disturbance of strength enough to be able to ruffle it. Therefore if there is a man able to regard the power of fortune, to regard all human vicissitudes that can possibly befall, as so far endurable that neither fear nor worry touch him, and if the same man should covet nothing, feel no transport of empty pleasure in his soul, what reason is there why he should not be happy? And if virtue makes this possible, what reason is there why virtue of its own power alone should not make men happy?</p>
<p>VII. A. Well at any rate there can be no question of the one pointâ€”that those who have no fear, no worry, no covetousness, no transport of ungovernable delight are happy, and so I grant you this; moreover the other problem has already had a breach made in it, for the result of our previous discussions was that the wise man is free from all disturbance of soul. M. Surely then the inquiry is finished, for the problem seems to have reached its solution. A. Almost so at any rate. M. And yet you argue here like the mathematicians,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_443_1" id="target_note_LCL141_443_1"><sup>1</sup></a> not like the philosophers. For geometricians, when they want to demonstrate some proposition, take for granted and proved anything in previous demonstrations which is germane to the subject; they only unravel the difficulty about which nothing has previously been written: philosophers collect together all that is applicable to any inquiry upon which they are engaged, even if it has all been thoroughly discussed elsewhere. Had this not been the case, why should the Stoic wax eloquent when asked whether virtue can be sufficient for leading a happy life? it would be enough for him to reply that he had previously
