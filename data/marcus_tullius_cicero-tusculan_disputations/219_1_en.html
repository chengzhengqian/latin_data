good, you must look out for some fresh arguments. Those you have given have no effect on me, not merely because they are hackneyed but much more because, as with certain light wines which lose their flavour in water,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_439_1" id="target_note_LCL141_439_1"><sup>1</sup></a> there is more delight in a sip than a draught of this Stoic vintage. For instance your troop of virtues, when laid upon the rack, bring before the eyes visions of majestic splendour, making it seem that happy life is on the point of hastening to them speedily and not suffering them to remain deserted by itself.
