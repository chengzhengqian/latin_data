for them to say so; for you have said a good deal in opposition to the opinion they hold<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_511_1" id="target_note_LCL141_511_1"><sup>1</sup></a> by adopting the conclusions of the Stoic reasoning. M. Let me then use the freedom allowed to my school of philosophic thought alone, which decides nothing on its own pronouncement but ranges over the whole field,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_511_2" id="target_note_LCL141_511_2"><sup>2</sup></a> in order that the question may be decided by others on its own merits, without invoking anyone’s authority. And since it appears that what you wish established is that, whatever the views held by warring sects about the limits<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_511_3" id="target_note_LCL141_511_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of good and evil, nevertheless virtue is sufficient security for a happy life, a proposition which Carneades<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_511_4a" id="target_note_LCL141_511_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> we are told habitually discussed—but he did so heatedly, as was his way in opposing the Stoics whom he was always most eager to refute, and against whose teaching his temper had fired up—for my part I shall treat the question calmly. For if the Stoics have rightly fixed the limits of the good,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_511_5" id="target_note_LCL141_511_5"><sup>5</sup></a> the question is settled: it follows of necessity that the wise man is always happy. But let us inquire, if possible, into each single opinion of the remaining schools of thought, that so this noble dogma, as it were, of happy life, can fit in with the views and teaching of them all.</p>
