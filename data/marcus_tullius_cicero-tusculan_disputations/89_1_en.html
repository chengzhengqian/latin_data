better and truer statement is that all such things as nature rejects are counted evils, all such things as nature accepts count as goods.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_179_1" id="target_note_LCL141_179_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Once determine this and do away with the verbal controversy,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_179_2" id="target_note_LCL141_179_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and it will be found that what the Stoics are right in clinging to, what we call honourable, right, becoming, and sometimes comprehend under the name of virtue—this will still stand out in such preeminence that, in comparison, all things which are held to be goods of body and fortune will seem insignificant and paltry, whilst it will also be found that no evil, even if all evils were heaped together, is to be compared with the evil of disgrace.
