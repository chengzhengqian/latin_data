<p>Do not philosophers of the highest eminence, who all the same have not yet attained the state of “wisdom,” understand that they are in a plight of utter evil?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_307_1" id="target_note_LCL141_307_1"><sup>1</sup></a> For they are unwise, and there is no greater evil than unwisdom; yet they do not lament. Why is this? Because to this kind of evil there is no adapting the belief that it is right and regular and a matter of duty to feel distressed at not being wise,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_307_2" id="target_note_LCL141_307_2"><sup>2</sup></a> whereas we do adapt this belief to the kind of distress that involves mourning, and such distress is the greatest of all. And so Aristotle in upbraiding the philosophers of old for thinking, according to him, that thanks to their genius philosophy had reached perfection, says that they had been guilty of extreme folly or boastfulness; all the same he adds that he saw that, as a consequence of the great advance made in a few years, philosophy would be absolutely complete.

He complained therefore that he was passing away when he had a glimpse of the promised land.
