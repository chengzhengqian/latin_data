unhealthiness and sickness of soul which they have termed “unsoundness.” Now philosophers apply the term disease to all disorders of the soul and they say that no foolish person is free from such diseases; sufferers from disease, however, are not sound, and the souls of all unwise persons are diseased: therefore all unwise persons are of “unsound” mind]. For they<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_235_1" id="target_note_LCL141_235_1"><sup>1</sup></a> considered that the sound health of souls consisted in a state of equable calm: they applied the term “unsoundness” to the mind that was not in this state, because they thought that in a disordered soul, as in a disordered body, soundness of health was impossible.</p>
<p>V. And there was no less insight in their giving to a condition of the soul, marked by an absence of the illuminating influence of the mind, the name of “mindlessness” as well as “aberration of mind”:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_235_2" id="target_note_LCL141_235_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and from this we must understand that those who gave these names to such conditions held the view which the Stoics took from Socrates and steadily adhered to, that all unwise persons are in an “unsound” state. For the soul which is suffering from some disease—now philosophers as I have said apply the term disease to these disordered movements—is no more in a sound condition than the body which is diseased. It follows that wisdom is a sound condition of the soul, unwisdom on the other hand a sort of unhealthiness which is unsoundness and also aberration of mind; and these attributes are much better connoted by the Latin terms than by the Greek, as will be found also in many other instances.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_235_3b" id="target_note_LCL141_235_3b"><sup>3</sup></a> But of that elsewhere; now for the business in hand.</p>
