and the attitude of the body, where there is no soul, is to produce melody. But let this musician, in spite of his being, as indeed he was, very learned, leave philosophy in the hands of his master Aristotle, and for himself continue his singing lessons: for it is a good rule laid down in the well-known Greek saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">The art which each man knows, in this let him employ himself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_51_1" id="target_note_LCL141_51_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Let us further utterly reject the notion of a soul made of indivisible smooth round bodies brought into accidental concurrence, in spite of the fact that Democritus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_51_2" id="target_note_LCL141_51_2"><sup>2</sup></a> holds it to be heated and airy, that is of the nature of breath. On the other hand, if the soul, as we regard it, belongs to the four classes of elements of which all things are said to consist, it consists of kindled air,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_51_3" id="target_note_LCL141_51_3"><sup>3</sup></a> as I see is the view which most commends itself to Panaetius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_51_4" id="target_note_LCL141_51_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and such a soul necessarily strives to reach higher regions; for the two lighter classes have no downward tendency and always seek the heights. Consequently if souls are dispersed in space, this takes place at a distance from the earth; if they survive and preserve their quality, all the more reason for their being carried to heaven and breaking their way through and parting asunder our dense and compact air which is nearest to earth; for the soul is hotter or, preferably, more glowing than our air which I just now described as dense and compact; and this may be known from the fact that our bodies, which are fashioned from the earthy class of elements,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_51_5" id="target_note_LCL141_51_5"><sup>5</sup></a> are heated by the glow of the soul.</p>
