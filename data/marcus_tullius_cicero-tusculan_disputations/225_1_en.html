Can I therefore, if I have granted him that bodily pains are counted evils, that shipwreck of fortune is counted evil, be angry with him when he says that not all good men are happy, since the things which he reckons as evil can come upon all good men?

Theophrastus, Cicero argues, should not be blamed for being consistent to his principle and saying that the man who suffers evils of fortune or body cannot be happy. It is the principle that there are three kinds of goods and their opposites, which should be attacked. Admit the principle and we have no right to be angry with Theophrastus for saying that, as good men can suffer in body and fortune, like the patriarch Job, they cannot all be happy. We must argue logically.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL141_451_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL141_451_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL141_451_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>περὶ εὐδαιμονίας.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL141_451_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL141_451_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL141_451_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>The Greek punishment ἐπὶ τοῦ τροχοῦ στρεβλοῦσθαι.
