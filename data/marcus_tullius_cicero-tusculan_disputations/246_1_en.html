But to come back to the point where I made this digression. Who in all the world, who enjoys merely some degree of communion with the Muses, that is to say with liberal education and refinement, is there who would not choose to be this mathematician rather than that tyrant? If we inquire into their manner of life and employment we see that the mind of the one found its sustenance in the problems of scientific research and enjoyed the exercise of its ingenuity—and this is the one most delightful spiritual food—whilst the mind of the other dwelt on murder and outrage, and fear was in its company both by day and night.
