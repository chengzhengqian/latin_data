need of” it, even if you should be conscious that you do not possess it. This argument must be repeatedly insisted upon when we have firmly established the point, about which, if souls are mortal, we can have no doubt, namely that destruction in death is so complete that not even the faintest vestige of sensation is left behind: when that, then, is properly settled for once and all, we must thoroughly sift, so as to be sure of it, the meaning of “feeling the need of,” that there may be no possibility of mistake in using the phrase. This then is the meaning of “feeling the need of,” <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_105_1" id="target_note_LCL141_105_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to be in want of anything you wish to possess; for there is a notion of wish in “feeling the need of,”—except when the word <span class="italic">carere</span> is used in another sense, as for instance of a fever, meaning “to be without fever.” For it is using the word in quite a different sense to use it where one has not got something and is conscious of not having it, even if one can readily put up with being without it. To” feel the need of” is not used in connection with evil; for then evil would not be a thing to grieve about: the expression “to feel the need of” a good is used, and that amounts to an evil. But not even a living man “feels the need of” a good, if he does not want it. In the case of a living man it is, however, intelligible to say that you “feel the need of” a throne—that, however, cannot be said quite accurately in your case, though it could have been in the case of Tarquin after he had been dethroned <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_105_2" id="target_note_LCL141_105_2"><sup>2</sup></a>—:

(1) In the phrase, however, <span class="italic">carere febri</span> the words mean “to be free from fever,” where one has not got fever and knows one has not got fever and is quite content that it should be so.

(3) We can say <span class="italic">carere bono</span>, for to “feel the need of” good is of itself an evil.
