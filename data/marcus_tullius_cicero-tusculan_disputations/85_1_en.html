<p>X. Let Aeschylus come forward, not merely a poet but a Pythagorean as well, for so we are told he was; how does Prometheus in Aeschylus’ play<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_171_1" id="target_note_LCL141_171_1"><sup>1</sup></a> bear the pain which he suffers for the theft of Lemnos!</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Whence it is said that in secret to mortals</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Fire was allotted; it cunning Prometheus</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Stole by his craft and the punishment rendered</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">By fate overruling to Jove.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Paying this punishment therefore when nailed to the Caucasus he speaks as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Offspring of Titans, linked in blood to ours,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Children of Heaven, see bound to rugged cliffs</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">A prisoner, like a ship on roaring seas</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Which timid sailors anchor, fearing night.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Jupiter, Saturn’s son, thus nailed me here,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Jove’s power claimed the hands of Mulciber;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_171_2" id="target_note_LCL141_171_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">These wedges he by cruel art pinned in</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And burst my limbs, and by his skill, poor wretch,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Pierced through, I make this Furies’ fort my home.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">More, each third fatal day Jove’s minister,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">In gloomy flight swoops here with talons bent,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">And tears me piecemeal for a savage feast.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Then crammed with liver fat and gorged in full</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Pours forth an echoing scream and soaring up</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">With feathered tail he strokes away my blood.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">When liver gnawn is swollen and grown afresh,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Greedy he then comes back to hideous meal.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Thus nourish I this guard of my sad torture</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Which mars my living frame with endless woe.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
