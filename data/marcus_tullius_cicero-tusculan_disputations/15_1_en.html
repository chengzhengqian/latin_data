it will vanish away. Why speak of Dicaearchus, a thinker who says the soul is nothing at all? According to all these views nothing can appertain to anyone after death, for along with life is lost the power of sensation; moreover there is nothing to make any sort of difference to a being without sensation. The views of the rest of the teachers offer the hope, if this happen to rejoice you, that souls, on their separation from the body, find their way to heaven as to their dwelling-place. A. It does rejoice me, and best of all I should like this to be the truth, and next I should like, even should it not prove true, to be persuaded of it all the same. M. What need have you then of our help? We cannot, can we, surpass Plato in eloquence? Turn over with attention the pages of his book upon the soul.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_31_1" id="target_note_LCL141_31_1"><sup>1</sup></a> You will be conscious of no further need. A. I have done so, be sure, and done so many times; but somehow I am sorry to find that I agree while reading, yet when I have laid the book aside and begin to reflect in my own mind upon the immortality of souls, all my previous sense of agreement<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_31_2" id="target_note_LCL141_31_2"><sup>2</sup></a> slips away. M. What do you mean by this? do you grant that souls either survive after death, or else perish by the mere fact of death? A. I do grant it. M. Well then—suppose they survive? A. I admit that they are happy. M. But suppose they perish? A. I admit that they are not wretched, since by hypothesis they have no existence: for this admission we made a little while back under the force of your argument. M. In what sense then or for what reason do you say that you consider death an evil, when it will either render us happy if our souls survive, or free from wretchedness if we are without sensation?</p>
