we see greedy of gain, not a few of fame, many slaves to lust, so that there is a strange contradiction between their public utterances and their life;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_159_1" id="target_note_LCL141_159_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and this seems to me a black disgrace. For just as it is if a teacher claiming to be a grammarian were guilty of solecisms, or one who should wish to be regarded as a musician were to sing out of tune; the disgrace would be enhanced by the fact of his failure in the very subject of which he professed the knowledge; similarly the philosopher who fails to observe his rule of life is the more deeply disgraced, because he stumbles in the duty of which he aims at being the teacher and fails in the conduct of life though professing to give the rule of life.</p>
<p>V. A. If it is as you say, have we not reason to fear that you are tricking out philosophy in borrowed plumes? What stronger proof of its uselessness can there be than to find instances of completely trained philosophers who lead disgraceful lives? M. That is really no proof, for not all cultivated fields are productive, and the dictum of Accius <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_159_2" id="target_note_LCL141_159_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is false:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Though placed in poorer soil good seed can yet</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Of its own nature bear a shining crop,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">and in the same way not all educated minds bear fruit. Moreover, to continue the same comparison, just as a field, however good the ground, cannot be productive without cultivation, so the soul cannot be productive without teaching. So true it is that the one without the other is ineffective. Now the cultivation of the soul is philosophy; this pulls out vices by the roots and makes souls fit for the reception of seed, and commits to the soul and, as we may say, sows in it seed of a kind to bear the richest fruit
