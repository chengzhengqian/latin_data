was common talk that those who saw Cn. Pompeius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_305_1" id="target_note_LCL141_305_1"><sup>1</sup></a> sinking under his wounds, in the alarm they felt for their own safety on witnessing that cruel and pitiful scene, because they saw themselves surrounded by the enemiesâ€™ fleet, did nothing else at the time except urge on the rowers and secure their safety by flight; only on reaching Tyre did they begin to indulge in grief and lamentation. Therefore fear had the power to drive away their distress, and shall not reason have power to drive it away from the wise man?</p>
<p>XXVIII. What, however, has more effect in putting grief aside than the realization of the fact that it gains us no advantage and that indulgence in it is useless? If then it can be set aside, it is also possible to refrain from indulging in it. It must therefore be admitted that distress is an indulgence due to an act of will and to conviction. And that is signified by the endurance of those who submit more readily to any mishap after they have frequently been through many experiences and who think they have at last succeeded in hardening themselves against fortune, like the character in Euripides:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Were this sad day the first that dawned for me,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Such sea of troubles had I not long sailed,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Good cause had been to toss like new-yoked colt</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But lately brought to bear the touch of bit;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">But quelled and numb with miseries am I now.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_305_2" id="target_note_LCL141_305_2"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Since, then, the exhaustion brought by miseries renders distresses milder, it must be understood that it is not the misfortune itself that is the cause and origin of mourning.</p>
