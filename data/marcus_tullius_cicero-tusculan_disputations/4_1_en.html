orators of such power that little or no ground at all was yielded in favour of the Greeks. Philosophy has lain neglected to this day, and Latin literature has thrown no light upon it: it must be illuminated and exalted by us, so that, if in the active business of life I have been of service to my countrymen, I may also, if I can, be of service to them in my leisure. And I must exert myself all the more actively because there are now, it is said, a number of books in Latin<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_9_1" id="target_note_LCL141_9_1"><sup>1a</sup></a> written without due care by writers who with all their merits are yet insufficiently equipped. Now it is possible for an author to hold right views and yet be unable to express them in a polished style; but to commit one’s reflections to writing, without being able to arrange or express them clearly or attract the reader by some sort of charm, indicates a man who makes an unpardonable misuse of leisure and his pen. The result is that such writers read their own books themselves along with their own circle, and none of them reaches any wider public than that which wishes to have the same privilege of scribbling extended to itself. For this reason, if by my assiduity I have won for our countrymen some measure of oratorical renown, I shall with far greater enthusiasm lay bare the springs of philosophy, which were also the source from which those earlier efforts of mine took their rise.</p>
