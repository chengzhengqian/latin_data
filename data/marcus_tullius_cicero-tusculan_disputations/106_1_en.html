What is more disgraceful for a man than womanish weeping? Moreover this rule which is laid down for pain has a wider scope, for we must resist everything and not merely pain with a similar straining of every nerve of the soul. Anger blazes up, lust is roused: we must hasten for refuge to the same citadel, we must take up the same weapons;—but as pain is our subject, let us leave other illustrations on one side.
