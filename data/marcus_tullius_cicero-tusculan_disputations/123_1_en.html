For it seems to be its special function to guide and compose the eager impulses of the soul and, by a constant opposition to lust, to preserve on every occasion a tempered firmness: and the vice which is its opposite is “worthlessness.” “Frugality,” as I think, is derived from “fruit” and nothing better comes from the earth: “worthlessness” is derived (the derivation, it may be, will be somewhat harsh; but all the same let us make the attempt; let it be taken as a jest if it should come to nothing) from that which is <span class="italic">nequidquam</span>, “for nothing,” in a man of that kind; hence he is also said to be “good for nothing.” The man therefore who is “frugal” or, should you prefer it, self-restrained and temperate must be firm; the firm man must be calm; the calm man must be free from all disturbance, therefore free from distress as well. All these are characteristic of the wise man. Therefore distress will keep far away from the wise man.</p>

In Plato, <span class="italic">Gorgias</span> 507, Socrates argues that ὁ σώφρων τὰ προσήκοντα πράττοι ἂν καὶ περὶ θεoὺς καὶ περὶ ἀνθρώπους. If the temperate man performs his duties to men, he will also be just, and if he avoids and pursues the things he ought to, he will also be courageous. The “frugal” man, Cicero says, shows fortitude, justice and prudence. “Frugality” embraces these three and also has its own peculiar quality, therefore, says Cicero, “frugality” is left for the fourth virtue, temperance.
