farming productive, not if the one always escapes all loss, the other always escapes all damage from bad weather, but if in the main there is in each a good margin of prosperity; so life can be termed happy, not only if it is brimful of good things of every sort, but if in the main and on the weightier side there is a marked preponderance of good. Therefore by the reasoning of these philosophers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_515_1" id="target_note_LCL141_515_1"><sup>1</sup></a> happy life will follow virtue even to torture and in its company pass down into the bull,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_515_2" id="target_note_LCL141_515_2"><sup>2</sup></a> on the authority of Aristotle, Xenocrates, Speusippus, Polemo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_515_3" id="target_note_LCL141_515_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and threats and bribes will not pervert it to abandon virtue.

The rest do seem to be in somewhat of a strait, still they manage to swim their way out—Epicurus, Hieronymus, and any who are found to care to support poor deserted Carneades. For there is none of them who does not regard the soul as judge of the true good and join in instructing it to be able to despise such things as have only the semblance of good or evil. For what you hold to be the case of Epicurus, will also be the case of Hieronymus and Carneades and, upon my word, of all the rest of them; for who of them is insufficiently provided against death or pain? Let us begin, if you will, with the man we name effeminate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_515_4" id="target_note_LCL141_515_4"><sup>4</sup></a> name a voluptuary.
