more aptly call them toilers, for toiling is one thing, feeling pain another. O Greece, you are sometimes deficient in the words of which you think you have such a plentiful supply! toiling I say is one thing, feeling pain another. When C. Marius had his varicose veins cut out he felt pain;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_185_1" id="target_note_LCL141_185_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when he led his column under a blazing sun he was toiling. All the same there is a sort of resemblance between the two things, for the habit of toil renders the endurance of pain easier. Accordingly those who gave to Greece the specific form of her governments were in favour of having young men’s bodies strengthened by toil; the citizens of Sparta applied the same rule to women, who in all other cities lead a luxurious mode of life and are “sequestered behind the shadow of walls.” The Spartans, however, wished for nothing of that sort</p>

<p class="noindent">It follows that pain sometimes intervenes in these toilsome exercises: the victims are driven on, struck, flung aside or fall, and toil of itself brings a certain callousness to pain.</p>
