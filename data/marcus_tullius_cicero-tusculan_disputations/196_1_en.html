wise man is lustful and irascible and anxious and fearful? Of his superiority there is indeed much that can be said as fully and widely as you will, but quite briefly it may be said that wisdom is the knowledge of things divine and human and acquaintance with the cause of each of them, with the result that wisdom copies what is divine, whilst it regards all human concerns as lower than virtue. Do you then say that in your opinion wisdom falls into the disorder we have described, as it were into a sea lying at the mercy of the winds? What is there with the power to disorder its deep seriousness and consistency? or think you some unforeseen or sudden chance can do so?

For there is assuredly some remedy, and nature has not proved so bitter an enemy of mankind as to discover so many means of providing bodily health without discovering a single one for the soul, to which she has even rendered this better service, that aids for the body are given
