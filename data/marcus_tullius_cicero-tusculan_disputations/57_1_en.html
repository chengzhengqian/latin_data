But if our minds are kept in the suspense and torture and anguish of expectation and longing, ye immortal gods! how delightful should the journey prove which at its close leaves us no further care, no anxiety for the future! How charmed I am with Theramenes! How lofty a spirit is his! For though we shed tears as we read, nevertheless a notable man dies a death that is not pitiable: he was flung into prison by order of the thirty tyrants, and when he had swallowed the poison like a thirsty man he tossed the remainder out of the cup<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_115_2" id="target_note_LCL141_115_2"><sup>2</sup></a> to make a splash, and with a laugh at the sound it made, “I drink this,” said he, “to the health of fair Critias,” the man who had treated him abominably; I may explain that at their banquets the Greeks make a practice of naming the guest to whom they are going to pass the cup.

Its object was to throw a small quantity of wine at a mark and make a sound in doing so. The mark was either a saucer floating in a big bowl of water or else a saucer attached to the rod of a special apparatus. Theramenes combined this with a toast.
