to look carefully for the solution which seems most probable. What is there then to be found in this problem, by the help of which we may make the port of probability? Further than this the mind of man cannot advance. There is the definition of disorder which I think Zeno rightly employed; for his definition<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_379_1" id="target_note_LCL141_379_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is that “disorder is an agitation of the soul alien from reason, contrary to nature,” or more briefly that “disorder is a longing of undue violence,” unduly violent however being understood to mean a longing which is far removed from the equability of nature. What, I ask, can the Peripatetics advance against these definitions? Besides, the words of the Stoics are in the main those of men arguing with wisdom and insight: the others deal in rhetorical fireworks,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_379_2" id="target_note_LCL141_379_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “kindlings of souls and whetstones of virtues.” Or is it the fact that a brave man cannot be brave unless he begins to lose his temper? True for gladiators—yes; and yet in these selfsame men we often see an equable spirit:</p>

<span class="line">This is the programme I think: in the face I shall</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
