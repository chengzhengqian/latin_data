On the other hand a beginning has no birth, for all things have origin in a beginning, but the beginning itself can be born from nothing else, for the thing that should be begotten from anything else would not be a beginning. Now if it never has origin, it never perishes either; for a beginning once destroyed will not be itself reborn from anything else, nor will it create anything else from itself, seeing that all things must have origin in a beginning.
