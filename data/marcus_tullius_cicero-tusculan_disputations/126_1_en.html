For every evil, even a moderate one, is an evil; but our object is that there should be no evil at all in the wise man. For as the body, even if moderately ailing, is not healthy;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_253_2" id="target_note_LCL141_253_2"><sup>2</sup></a> so in the soul the so-called mean or moderate state is without health.</p>
<p>And so our countrymen, as in many other instances, showed a fine instinct in giving the name of “distress” to vexation, anxiety, and anguish, because of their resemblance to the condition of bodies out of health. By almost the same term the Greeks describe all disturbance of the soul; for they use πάθος,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_253_3" id="target_note_LCL141_253_3"><sup>3</sup></a> that is to say, “disease,” for any troubled movement whatever in the soul. We do better; for distress of soul closely resembles the condition of bodies out of health; but lust does not resemble sickness, intemperate joy does not, which is an excited and exuberant pleasure of the soul. Actual fear too is not very like disease, though closely akin to distress.

The Peripatetics taught Aristotle’s doctrine of the “mean,” a balance between two extremes. Virtue is the mean between two extremes, as for instance courage is the “mean” between rashness and cowardice, cf. § 74. The “mean” expresses the Greek notion of the beauty of virtue in its harmony and proportion rather than the absolute difference between right and wrong. But Aristotle said that in its essence virtue was an extreme utterly remote from vice. The difference between virtue and vice was not merely quantitative as Cicero seems to think the Peripatetics supposed.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL141_253_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL141_253_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL141_253_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>The Peripatetics did not admit the “mean” in a bad state.
