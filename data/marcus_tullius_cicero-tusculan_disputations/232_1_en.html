Therefore if this soul has been so trained, if its power of vision has been so cared for<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_465_2" id="target_note_LCL141_465_2"><sup>2</sup></a> that it is not blinded by error, the result is mind made perfect, that is, complete reason, and this means also virtue.
