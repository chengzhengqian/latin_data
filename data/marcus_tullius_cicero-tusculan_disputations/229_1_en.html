Because I have lately read the fourth book of your <span class="italic">de Finibus</span>: there it appeared to me that in arguing against Cato you wished to show what for my part I approve, namely, that there is no difference between Zeno and the Peripatetics except novel terminology; and if this is so, what reason is there, if it fits in with Zeno’s system for virtue to have great power in securing happy life, why the Peripatetics should not be allowed to say the same?
