they maintain that the soul can survive without a body, the point of greatest difficulty in the whole problem, but chop away what is not only easy of belief, but, if their view is granted, a logical consequence, namely that the soul does not perish when it has survived a long time. M. Your criticism is just, and that is how the case stands. Are we then to believe Panaetius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_93_1" id="target_note_LCL141_93_1"><sup>1</sup></a> when he disagrees with his revered Plato? for whilst he calls him at every mention of his name inspired, the wisest, the most saintly of men, the Homer of philosophers, he yet fails to approve of this one opinion of his about the immortality of souls. For he holds what nobody denies, that whatever has been born perishes; but he asserts that souls are born, as is shown by the resemblance of children to their parents, which is manifest in dispositions and not only in bodily features. He alleges next as his second proof that there is nothing sensible of pain without being also susceptible of sickness; all, however, that is subject to disease, will also perish; now souls are sensible of pain, therefore they also perish.</p>
