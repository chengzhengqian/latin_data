For we must, as it were, shore up in every way those who are toppling over and unable to stand because of the extent of their distress. Hence, Chrysippus thinks that distress gets its own name λύπη<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_297_3" id="target_note_LCL141_297_3"><sup>3</sup></a> as being a dissolution of the whole man, and it can be entirely rooted out when we have
