<p>XI. Whilst there is theoretically a difference between the ailments I am dealing with, in practice at any rate they are combined and their origin is found in lust and delight. For when money is coveted and reason is not at once applied as a kind of Socratic remedy to cure the desire, the evil circulates in the veins and fastens on the vital organs, and disease and sickness ensue, things which cannot be plucked out when they are long established; and for such a disease the name is <span class="italic">avarice</span>.
