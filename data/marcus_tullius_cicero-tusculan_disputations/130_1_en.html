is a natural<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_261_1" id="target_note_LCL141_261_1"><sup>1</sup></a> effect, in the sense that anyone who contemplates some considerable evil at once feels distress, should he imagine that it has befallen him. The Cyrenaics consider that distress is not caused by every evil but by an unlooked for and unexpected evil. That, it is true, has no ordinary effect in heightening distress, for all sudden visitations seem more serious than others. Hence it is that these lines are rightly praised:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_261_2" id="target_note_LCL141_261_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">I begat them and begetting knew that them for</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">death I reared.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Also when to Troy I sent them Greece to fight</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">for and defend,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Well I knew to deadly warfare not for feasting</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>XIV. This anticipation therefore of the future mitigates the approach of evils whose coming one has long foreseen. And so the words Euripides has put into the mouth of Theseus <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_261_3" id="target_note_LCL141_261_3"><sup>3</sup></a> are praised, for it is allowable, according to our frequent practice, to turn them into Latin:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">For since this lesson from wise lips I learnt,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Within my heart I pondered ills to come:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Untimely death or exile’s sullen flight,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Or other weight of woe I mused on aye,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">That if dread chance should bring calamity,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">No sudden care should rend me unprepared.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">By the lesson which Theseus says he learnt from a wise man, Euripides means a lesson which he had learnt himself. For he had been a pupil of Anaxagoras,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_262_1" id="target_note_LCL141_262_1"><sup>1</sup></a>
