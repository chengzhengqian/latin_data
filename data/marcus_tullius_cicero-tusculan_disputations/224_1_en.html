not supremely happy; secondly that most things get their name from that which forms, even if a fraction be missing, the greater part of them, such things for instance as strength, as health, as riches, as honour, as glory which are discerned as present in essence if not in every detail; in the same way happy life, even though it should in some part be lame,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_449_1" id="target_note_LCL141_449_1"><sup>1</sup></a> yet gets its name from what forms by far the greater part of it. It is not at present necessary to give a full explanation of this view, and yet it seems to me that the statement is not wholly consistent; for I do not understand, for one thing, what the man who is happy wants in order to be happier (for if anything is to be missing, he is not so much as happy),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_449_2" id="target_note_LCL141_449_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and as to the statement that each single thing gets its title and estimation from that which forms the greater part of it, there are cases where this holds in the way described: but as they<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_449_3" id="target_note_LCL141_449_3"><sup>3</sup></a> say there are three kinds of evil—when a man is beset with all the evils of two kinds<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_449_4" id="target_note_LCL141_449_4"><sup>4</sup></a> so that his lot is dogged with every kind of adversity, his body reduced and weakened with all manner of pains—shall we say that such a man “wants but little” to secure a happy life, to say nothing of a supremely happy life?</p>
<p>IX. This is the position Theophrastus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_449_5" id="target_note_LCL141_449_5"><sup>5</sup></a> proved unable to defend. For after deciding that blows, the rack, torture, ruin of country, exile, childlessness had great influence in rendering life evil and wretched, he did not venture to speak in an exalted and dignified strain, as his thoughts were mean and low: how far he was right is not the question now;
