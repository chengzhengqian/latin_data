all the same the sting and certain minor symptoms of shrinking<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_325_1" id="target_note_LCL141_325_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of soul will be left. Let them say that this is quite natural, provided the term distress with its harsh, ugly, melancholy associations is not used, for it is a term that cannot go along with wisdom and cannot, so to speak, in any way share its habitation. But how far-reaching the roots of distress, how numerous, how bitter! All of them, when the trunk itself<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_325_2" id="target_note_LCL141_325_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is overturned, must be picked out, and, if need be, by a discussion for each separate one. For I have this single boon left to me, whatever its worth, of leisure.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_325_3" id="target_note_LCL141_325_3"><sup>3</sup></a> There is one principle in all forms of distress; their names are many. For envy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_325_4" id="target_note_LCL141_325_4"><sup>4</sup></a> is a form of distress, and rivalry and jealousy and compassion and trouble, lament, mourning, attacks of suffering, wailing, agitation, grief, vexation, torment and despondency. All these the Stoics define, and the terms I have given are used for each manifestation of distress; they do not, as it appears, mean the same, but there is a difference which we shall, it may be, deal with in another place. These, however, are the filaments of the roots of which I spoke at the outset, and are to be followed up and picked out, so that none of them can ever be found again. A great undertaking and a hard one, who denies it? But what noble undertaking is not also hard?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_325_5" id="target_note_LCL141_325_5"><sup>5</sup></a> Yet, all the same, philosophy claims that she will succeed: only let us consent to her treatment. But so much at any rate so far. All else, as often as you will, whether in this spot or in others, will be in readiness for you.</p>
