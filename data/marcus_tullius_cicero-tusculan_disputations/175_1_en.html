Therefore just as temperance allays the cravings and causes them to obey right reason, and maintains the well-considered judgments of the mind, so intemperance its enemy kindles, confounds and agitates the whole condition of the soul, with the result that from it come distress and fear and all other disorders.</p>

Moreover from disorders are produced, in the first place, diseases (for which the term is νοσήματα), and besides these the affections which are the opposites of such diseases and which are accompanied by unwholesome aversion and loathing for certain things; secondly there are produced sicknesses, termed by the Stoics ἀῤῥωστήματα, and these too have corresponding aversions which are their “opposites.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_351_2a" id="target_note_LCL141_351_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> At this point far too much attention is devoted by the Stoics, principally by Chrysippus, to drawing an analogy between diseases of the soul and diseases of the body.
