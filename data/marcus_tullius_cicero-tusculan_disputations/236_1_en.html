is not anyone you will who can possess what is good: I pass over good birth and public reputation where it is called into being by the united voice of fools and knaves: but take such insignificant things—we have to <span class="italic">call</span> them good—as white teeth, fine eyes, fresh colour and the things that Anticlea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_473_1" id="target_note_LCL141_473_1"><sup>1</sup></a> praises in washing the feet of Ulysses,</p>

Further the disposition of the soul in a good man is praiseworthy, and therefore the life of a good man is praiseworthy, and for that reason right, seeing that it is praiseworthy.
