as such a mansion of refuge has been prepared for us as a result of yesterday’s discussion. For if a god should say to some navigator confronted with a chase by pirates: “Cast yourself from the ship; there is either a dolphin ready to pick you up like Arion of Methymna,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_223_1" id="target_note_LCL141_223_1"><sup>1</sup></a> or else the famous horses of Neptune, which aided Pelops<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_223_2a" id="target_note_LCL141_223_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> and are said ‘to have hurried the car afloat over the waves,’ will pick you up and carry you whither you will,” he would cast off all fear; similarly when unpleasing and hateful pains assail you, if they should be too keen to be borne, you see the refuge to which you must fly. This is pretty nearly what I thought should be said in the time available. But it may be you adhere to your opinion. A. By no means so, and it is my hope that I have in two days been set free from the fear of two things of which I was desperately afraid. M. To-morrow then we will practise declamation by the water-clock, for so we have arranged and I see that this cannot be refused you. A. Exactly so: the practice in the morning and the discussion at the same time as to-day. M. It shall be so, and we shall comply with your excellent inclinations.</p>
