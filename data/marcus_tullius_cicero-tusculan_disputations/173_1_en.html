good and a bad sense. For one thing, rivalry is used of the imitation of virtue (but this sense we make no use of here, for it is praiseworthy); and rivalry is distress, should another be in possession of the object desired and one has to go without it oneself. <span class="italic">Jealousy</span> on the other hand is what I understand to be the meaning of ζηλοτυπία, distress arising from the fact that the thing one has coveted oneself is in the possession of the other man as well as one’s own. <span class="italic">Compassion</span> is distress arising from the wretchedness of a neighbour in undeserved suffering, for no one is moved by compassion for the punishment of a murderer or a traitor. <span class="italic">Anxiety</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_347_1" id="target_note_LCL141_347_1"><sup>1</sup></a> is oppressive distress; <span class="italic">mourning</span> is distress arising from the untimely death of a beloved object; <span class="italic">sadness</span> is tearful distress; <span class="italic">trouble</span> is burdensome distress; deep <span class="italic">grief</span> is torturing distress; <span class="italic">lamenting</span> is distress accompanied by wailing; <span class="italic">depression</span> is distress accompanied by brooding; <span class="italic">vexation</span> is lasting distress; <span class="italic">pining</span> is distress accompanied by bodily suffering; <span class="italic">despondency</span> is distress without any prospect of amelioration. The divisions under the head of fear are defined in this way: <span class="italic">sluggishness</span> as fear of ensuing toil [<span class="italic">shame</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_347_2a" id="target_note_LCL141_347_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> as fear causing diffusion of blood]; <span class="italic">fright</span> as paralyzing fear which causes paleness, trembling and chattering of teeth, just as blushing is caused by shame; <span class="italic">timidity</span> as the fear of approaching evil; <span class="italic">consternation</span> as fear upsetting the mental balance: and hence the line of Ennius:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_347_3" id="target_note_LCL141_347_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
