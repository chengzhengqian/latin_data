It has, I think, been sufficiently insisted on that distress is the idea of a present evil with this implication in it, that it is a duty to feel distress.</p>
<p>An addition to this definition is rightly made by Zeno, namely that this idea of a present evil is a “fresh”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_315_1" id="target_note_LCL141_315_1"><sup>1</sup></a> one. This word, however, his followers interpret to mean that not only, according to their view, is that “fresh” which has taken place a short time previously, but that so long as the imagined evil preserves a certain power of being vigorous and retaining so to speak its greenness,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_315_2" id="target_note_LCL141_315_2"><sup>2</sup></a> it is termed “fresh.” For instance the famous Artemisia, wife of Mausolus, King of Caria, who built the celebrated burial monument at Halicarnassus, lived in sorrow all her days and wasted away under its enfeebling influence.

There are some who think it the sole duty of a comforter to insist that the evil has no existence at all, as is the view of Cleanthes;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_315_3" id="target_note_LCL141_315_3"><sup>3</sup></a> some, like the Peripatetics, favour the lesson that the evil is not serious. Some again favour the withdrawal of attention from evil to good, as Epicurus does; some, like the Cyrenaics, think it enough to show that nothing unexpected has taken place. Chrysippus on the other hand considers that the main thing in giving
