his folly, not his sorrow; the season for the lesson is, however, unfavourable. And yet it seems to me Cleanthes has not quite seen that the feeling of distress can sometimes arise from the very thing which he himself admits to be the worst evil of all. For what shall we say—seeing that Socrates, as we are told, convinced Alcibiades that he was in no true sense a man and that there was no difference, for all his high position, between him and any poor porter, whereupon Alcibiades was much distressed and implored Socrates with tears to teach him virtue and drive baseness away,—what shall we say, Cleanthes?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_319_1" id="target_note_LCL141_319_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Surely not that there was no evil in the cause which made Alcibiades feel distress? Another point: what is the meaning of Lyco’s words?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_319_2" id="target_note_LCL141_319_2"><sup>2</sup></a> By way of minimizing distress he says that it is occasioned by trifling circumstances, discomforts of fortune and of body, not by evils of the soul. I ask you then—the grief which Alcibiades felt, did it not come from evils and flaws in the soul? As for the comfort Epicurus suggests, enough has been previously said.</p>

Cleanthes can only say that the “wise man” is free from evil and cannot feel distress or sorrow: Lyco says that distress is occasioned by trifles. What can either of them do for Alcibiades? Is his distress real or not? Is it or is it not due to “evil”?
