kindled by temptation is hurried away to the apparent good, and delight shows itself in exuberant transport at having at length secured some coveted object: for by a law of nature all men pursue apparent good and shun its opposite; for which reason, as soon as the semblance of any apparent good presents itself, nature of itself prompts them to secure it. Where this takes place in an equable and wise way the Stoics employ the term βούλησις for this sort of longing,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_341_1" id="target_note_LCL141_341_1"><sup>1</sup></a> we should employ the term <span class="italic">wish</span>.

Where, however, wish is alien from reason and is too violently aroused, it is lust or unbridled desire, which is found in all fools. And also, where we are satisfied that we are in possession of some good, this comes about in two ways: for when the soul has this satisfaction rationally and in a tranquil and equable way, then the term <span class="italic">joy</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_341_2" id="target_note_LCL141_341_2"><sup>2</sup></a> is employed; when on the other hand the soul is in a transport of meaningless extravagance, then the satisfaction can be termed <span class="italic">exuberant</span> or <span class="italic">excessive delight</span> and this they define as irrational excitement of the soul.
