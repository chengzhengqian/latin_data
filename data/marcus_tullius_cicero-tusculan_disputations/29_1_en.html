and in the excess of their joy render thanks to its discoverer and founder and do reverence to him as a god <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_59_1" id="target_note_LCL141_59_1"><sup>1</sup></a>: they say that through him they have been set free from tyrannous masters, from unending terror and daily and nightly fear. What terror? What fear? Where is the crone so silly as to be afraid of the bugbears of which you gentlemen would, it is obvious, have been afraid, if you had not studied natural philosophy? <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_59_2" id="target_note_LCL141_59_2"><sup>2</sup></a> “The lofty Acherunsian temples of Orcus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_59_3" id="target_note_LCL141_59_3"><sup>3</sup></a> wan haunts of Death, regions clouded over with darkness.” Should not a philosopher blush to boast of not being afraid of such things and of having discovered their falsity? And from this we can realize the natural intelligence of those folk who would, without instruction, have believed them true. Yes, but it is a notable achievement to have learnt that, when once the hour of death had come, they would wholly perish! And granted that it be so—I am not contesting it—what ground is there in this for joy or boasting? And yet no reason really suggests itself to my mind why the belief of Pythagoras and Plato <a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_59_4" id="target_note_LCL141_59_4"><sup>4</sup></a> should not be true. For though Plato produced no reasoned proof—note the tribute I pay the man—he would crush me by the mere weight of his authority: he has, on the contrary, produced such a number of proofs that it seems he wished to convince others, and beyond doubt he seems to have convinced himself.</p>
