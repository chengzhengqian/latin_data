songs? What things Alcaeus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_411_1" id="target_note_LCL141_411_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a man of bravery and of note in his country, writes about the love of youths! Of Anacreon I say nothing, for his work is all love-poetry. Above all, however, Ibycus of Rhegium was, it is clear from his writings, a passionate lover.</p>
<p>XXXIV. In fact we see that love in all the examples given is lustful. We philosophers have come forward (and on the authority indeed of our Plato<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_411_2" id="target_note_LCL141_411_2"><sup>2</sup></a> whom Dicaearchus not unjustly upbraids) to attribute authority to love. The Stoics actually both say that the wise will experience love, and define love itself as the endeavour to form a friendship inspired by the semblance of beauty. And if in the actual world there is an instance of love free from disquietude, from longing, from anxiety, from sighing, then so be it! if you will; for such love has no element of lust; but our discourse is about lust.

<p>But in this case all the gods were to “have care” how he might enjoy the pleasures of love.</p>

<span class="line indent10">Ah me unhappy!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">Nothing more true. With reason too the other:</p>
