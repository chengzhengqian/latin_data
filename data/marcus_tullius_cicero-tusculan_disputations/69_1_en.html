was far the best thing for man not to be born at all, but the next best was to die as soon as possible. Euripides has made use of this maxim in the <span class="italic">Cresphontes</span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">For we should mourn in sorrowing throngs the</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent5">house</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">Where a man child is born to light of day,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

</p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">By quoting these and similar authorities rhetoricians maintain that in this trial the immortal gods have given their verdict by facts. Alcidamas, for instance, an ancient rhetorician of the first distinction, actually wrote an encomium on death which consists of a list of the evils to which mankind are exposed; he has failed to give those deeper arguments which the philosophers bring together, but he has not failed in wealth of eloquence. But noble deaths, sought voluntarily, for the sake of country, are not only commonly reckoned glorious by rhetoricians but also happy. They go back to Erechtheus, whose daughters
