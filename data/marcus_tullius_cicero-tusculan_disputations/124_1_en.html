defective when in a swollen and inflamed state? Similarly then the soul, when puffed up and swollen, is in a defective state. Bub the soul of the wise man is always free from defect and never in an inflamed, never in a swollen state; but this is the condition of the angry soul: therefore the wise man is never angry. For if he is angry he is also covetous. The covetousness peculiar to the angry man is the desire to stamp the brand of uttermost pain upon the person by whom he considers himself injured.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_249_1" id="target_note_LCL141_249_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Moreover the man who has coveted this end must necessarily be greatly rejoiced if he has secured it. Hence it comes about that he rejoices in another’s misfortune. As the wise man is incapable of this, he is also incapable of feeling anger either. But should the wise man be susceptible of distress, he would also be susceptible of anger, and as he is free from anger he will also be free from distress. For if the wise man could be capable of feeling distress he could be also of feeling compassion,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_249_2" id="target_note_LCL141_249_2"><sup>2</sup></a> he could feel envy.

<p class="noindent">Bad Latin, it seems; but admirably said by Accius; for just as <span class="italic">videre</span>, “to look at,” takes the accusative, so <span class="italic">invidere florem</span>, “to look askance upon the promise,” is truer than the use of <span class="italic">flori</span> the dative.
