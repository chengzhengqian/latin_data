And to my mind the effect upon wise men of previous consideration is pretty much the same as the effect of lapse of time upon others; only it is a process of reasoning which restores the former, while nature left to herself restores the latter, when once the root of the matter is grasped, namely that the evil which was greatest in anticipation is by no means great enough to ruin a happy life. All, therefore, we need conclude is that the shock from the unexpected is more severe, not, as the Cyrenaics think, that, where two men have met with equal misfortune, only the one on whom the misfortune has come unexpectedly is a victim to distress. And so<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_295_4a" id="target_note_LCL141_295_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> some, it is said, when sadness comes, have felt a still deeper pang on being told of this common lot of mankind, namely that it is the law of our entry into this world that no one
