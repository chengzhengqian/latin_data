If the part of the soul, which I have described as yielding, conducts itself disgracefully, if it give way in womanish fashion to lamentation and weeping, let it be fettered and tightly bound by the guardianship of friends and relations; for often we find men crushed by a sense of shame who would never be overcome by any reason. Such persons therefore we shall have almost to keep in chains and guard closely like slaves, whilst those who shall be found more steadfast, though not of the highest strength, we shall have to warn to be mindful of honour, like good soldiers recalled to duty.
