says (for the foregoing definitions are due to Sphaerus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_387_1" id="target_note_LCL141_387_1"><sup>1</sup></a> a man pre-eminent in framing definitions according to the Stoics: no matter, for in any case their definitions have a common family resemblance, but they explain more or less the ideas generally held)—how then does Chrysippus speak? Bravery is, he says, the knowledge of enduring vicissitudes or a disposition of soul in suffering and enduring, obedient to the supreme law of our being without fear. However we may attack<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_387_2" id="target_note_LCL141_387_2"><sup>2</sup></a> such men, as was the way of Carneades, I have a misgiving they are the only true philosophers; for which of the definitions I have given does not reveal the meaning of the idea we all have of bravery, hidden though it be behind a veil? And when revealed, who is there to ask for any further support for warrior or general or orator and to think them incapable of any brave deed without frenzy? Again, do not the Stoics, who say that everyone who is not wise is mad, bring together in their conclusion the instances we have given? Take out disorders and above all irascibility; the result is they will seem to be talking rubbish.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_387_3" id="target_note_LCL141_387_3"><sup>3</sup></a> But, as it is, their line of argument is to assert that all fools are mad in the same way that all mud stinks. Surely not always.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_387_4" id="target_note_LCL141_387_4"><sup>4</sup></a> Stir it and you will see! Similarly the irascible man is not always angry; rouse him! now you will see him in a rage. Again, this combative irascibility of yours,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_387_5" id="target_note_LCL141_387_5"><sup>5</sup></a> when it has got back home, what is it like with wife, with children, with household? Or do you think it useful there as well as in battle? Is there a thing that the disordered mind can do better than the equable mind? Or is anyone at all
