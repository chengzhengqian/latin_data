Archimedes fastened on a globe<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_75_1" id="target_note_LCL141_75_1"><sup>1</sup></a> the movements of moon, sun and five wandering stars, he, just like Plato’s God who built the world in the <span class="italic">Timaeus</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_75_2" id="target_note_LCL141_75_2"><sup>2</sup></a> made one revolution of the sphere control several movements utterly unlike in slowness and speed. Now if in this world of ours phenomena cannot take place without the act of God, neither could Archimedes have reproduced the same movements upon a globe without divine genius.</p>

To my mind even better known and more famous fields of labour do not seem removed from divine influence, or suffer me to think that the poet pours out his solemn, swelling strain without some heavenly inspiration, or that eloquence Hows in a copious stream of echoing words and fruitful thoughts without some higher influence: as to philosophy, the mother of all arts, what else is it except, as Plato held, the gift,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_75_3" id="target_note_LCL141_75_3"><sup>3</sup></a> or, as I hold, the discovery of the gods?
