from intense meditation by the use of song and the music of the harp to calm their minds, Cato, a writer of great authority, has stated in his <span class="italic">Origines</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_331_1" id="target_note_LCL141_331_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that at banquets it was the custom of our ancestors for the guests at table to sing one after the other to the accompaniment of the flute in praise of the merits of illustrious men. And from this it is clear that, in addition to poems, songs set to music were already at that date written down to guide the voice of the singer. And yet as much as this is formally shown also by the Twelve Tables, namely, that by that time the composition of songs was regularly practised: because it is expressly enacted that this may not be done to a neighbour’s detriment.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_331_2" id="target_note_LCL141_331_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And it is by no means a proof of an uninstructed age that stringed instruments play a prelude at the festivals<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_331_3" id="target_note_LCL141_331_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of the gods and the feasts of the magistrates: and this was a special feature of the Pythagorean training of which 1 am speaking. For my part too I think that the poem<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_331_4" id="target_note_LCL141_331_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of Appius Caecus, which is highly praised by Panaetius in a certain letter addressed to Q. Tubero, was Pythagorean. In our ancient usages too there is much that has been taken over from the Pythagoreans, which I pass by, that it may not appear that we have learned from other sources the things we are thought to have discovered for ourselves. But to come back to the main argument, how short is the period of time in which there have appeared such a number of great poets and such famous orators besides! So that it can be readily seen that our countrymen had the power to achieve success in all directions, as soon as they conceived the wish to do so.</p>
