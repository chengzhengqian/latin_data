in men’s minds a sort of deeply rooted presentiment of future ages, and this feeling is strongest and most evident in men of the greatest genius and the loftiest spirit. Take this feeling away and who would be such a madman as to pass his life continually in toil and peril? So far, I am speaking of statesmen, but what of poets? Have they no wish to become famous after death? What then is the meaning of the passage?:—</p>
