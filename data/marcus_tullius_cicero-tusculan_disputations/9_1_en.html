either be or not be. Have you not taken so much as a first step in logic? This is an elementary lesson. Every proposition—this is the word that at the moment it has occurred to me to use for the term ἀξίωμα: I shall employ another word later if I can find a better—a proposition then is a statement which is true or false: therefore when you say “wretched Marcus Crassus,” either you say” Marcus Crassus is wretched,” so that it can be settled whether the statement is true or false, or you say nothing at all.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_19_1" id="target_note_LCL141_19_1"><sup>1</sup></a> A. Well! I grant now that the dead are not wretched, seeing that you forced me to admit that those who did not exist at all could not be wretched either. But what of this? Are not we the living wretched, seeing that we have to die? What satisfaction can there be in living, when day and night we have to reflect that at this or that moment we must die?</p>

A. What aphorism? I am not acquainted with it. M. I shall give it if I can in Latin: you know I am no more in the habit of using Greek in speaking Latin than of using Latin in speaking Greek. A. Quite right. But what, pray, is this aphorism of Epicharmus?</p>
