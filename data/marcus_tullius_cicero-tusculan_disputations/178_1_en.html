It is apparent also in a number of defects<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_357_1" id="target_note_LCL141_357_1"><sup>1</sup></a>; but for this there is no name. Men therefore are called both envious and malicious (and jealous) and fearful and compassionate because of a proneness to such disorders, not because they are always being hurried into them. This proneness then of each individual to his own peculiar disorder would on the analogy of the body be called sickness, provided it be understood as proneness to sickness. But in the case of what is good, because some men are better adapted to one sort of good and others to another, let it be named <span class="italic">inclination;</span> in the case of what is evil let it be named <span class="italic">proneness</span> so as to suggest slipping; in the case of what is neither good nor bad let it have the earlier name.</p>

So it comes that in the one perversion of beliefs the result is disease and sickness, in the other the result is inconsistency and discord. For not every defect involves equal want of harmony, as for instance the disposition of those who are not far off
