that a sober man may not be a victim to the violence of those who are heated with wine. Thus by running away one can escape the assaults of fortune which one cannot face. This is the same advice as Epicurus gives and Hieronymus repeats it in as many words.</p>
<p>But if the philosophers who hold the view that virtue in and by itself is quite ineffective—whilst everything that <span class="italic">we</span> say is honourable and praiseworthy, <span class="italic">they</span> say is mere emptiness tricked out in a sounding phrase that has no meaning—if nevertheless they think that the wise man is always happy, what, pray, do you conclude that philosophers who go back to Socrates and Plato ought to do? Some<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_545_1" id="target_note_LCL141_545_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of them say that the superiority of goods of the soul is so marked that they eclipse goods of the body or external goods, while others<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_545_2" id="target_note_LCL141_545_2"><sup>2</sup></a> think that such things are not goods at all and make all good rest with the soul. The controversy between them used to be decided by Carneades in his capacity of umpire chosen as a compliment by the disputants; for as all that the Peripatetics regarded as goods were also regarded by the Stoics as advantages, and as the Peripatetics did not in spite of their opinion attach more value to riches, good health and the other things of the same kind than the Stoics did, he said that inasmuch as the determining factor is the thing, not the words, there was no ground for disagreement. Therefore it is for the philosophers of the other schools themselves to consider how they can maintain their position; I nevertheless welcome the fact that in agreeing upon the uninterrupted power of the wise man to lead a good life their avowal is one worthy of the utterance of philosophers.</p>
