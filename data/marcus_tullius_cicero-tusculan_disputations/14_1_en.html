class without a name and accordingly applies to the actual soul a new term, ἐνδελέχεια,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_29_1" id="target_note_LCL141_29_1"><sup>1</sup></a> descriptive of a sort of uninterrupted and perpetual movement.</p>
<p>XI. These, unless I happen to have missed any, are pretty nearly the views held about the soul. There is, it is true, Democritus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_29_2" id="target_note_LCL141_29_2"><sup>2</sup></a> a man of undoubted power, but, as he makes the soul consist of minute smooth round bodies brought together in some sort of accidental collision, let us pass him over; for there is nothing which thinkers of his school cannot construct out of a swarm of atoms. Which of these views is the true one it is for a divine being to determine: which is most probable is a difficult question. Are we in favour of deciding between these views or of going back to the subject first put forward?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_29_3" id="target_note_LCL141_29_3"><sup>3</sup></a> A. My wish would be for both courses if it could be managed, but it is a difficult matter to combine the two. Therefore if, without discussing these further questions, we can get free from the fear of death, let this be our aim; but if that is impossible, unless this problem of the nature of the soul is first unravelled, let us take that problem first and the other question later. M. I think the course I understand you to prefer is the more convenient; for rational investigation will show that, whichever of the views I have stated is the true one, death is either not an evil or, better, a positive good. For if the soul is the heart or blood or brain, then assuredly, since it is material, it will perish with the rest of the body; if it is breath it will perhaps be dispersed in space; if fire it will be quenched; if it is the harmony of Aristoxenus

In Aristotle the word used is ἐντελέχεια, <span class="italic">actus, perfectio</span>, the perfect state of a thing: ἐνδελέχεια on the other hand is <span class="italic">continuatio</span>, as when the constant dropping of water hollows out stone. This is movement, and Aristotle denies any movement to the soul. It seems then that if Cicero wrote ἐντελέχεια he has given it a wrong meaning: if he wrote ἐνδελέχεια he has not used Aristotle’s word. That the difficulty about the two words is a very old one is shown by Lucian’s Δίκη Φωναέντων 10, where δέλτα accuses ταῦ of filching ἐνδελέχεια illegally and getting it turned into ἐντελέχεια.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL141_29_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL141_29_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL141_29_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Democritus of Abdera, about 460 <span class="sc">b.c</span>., the founder of the atomic theory.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL141_29_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL141_29_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL141_29_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>§ 9.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL141_29_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
