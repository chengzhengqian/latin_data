I am speaking of. What delight now should I feel at meeting Palamedes, at meeting Ajax<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_119_1" id="target_note_LCL141_119_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and at meeting others overthrown by an unjust sentence! I might test the wisdom of the supreme king who led the mighty host to Troy, and the wisdom of Ulysses and Sisyphus, without risk of a capital sentence for putting my questions to them as I used to do here. Do not you either, the judges who have voted for my acquittal, have fear of death. For no evil can befall any good man either in life or in death, nor will his troubles ever be disregarded by the immortal gods, nor has my own lot come by accident. In truth I have no ground for anger with my accusers or those who have condemned me, except that they have believed that they are doing me an injury.” So much he said in this fashion; yet nothing is better than the close: “but the time has now come,” he says, “for departure, I to die, you to go on with your lives. Which of the two, however, is better the immortal gods know; no human being, I think, does know.”</p>
<p>XLII. Verily I should prefer above measure to have such a soul to the possessions of all those who passed sentence upon him: and yet he does himself know what is known, he says, to no one except the gods, which of the two is better—for he has said previously that he knew—; but he holds firmly to the last his principle of asserting nothing. Let us on our side hold fast the principle of accounting nothing evil which has been bestowed by nature upon all mankind, and of realizing that if death be an evil it is an everlasting evil. For death seems to be the end of a wretched life; if death is wretched, there can be no end to its wretchedness.
