they themselves would wish if they were conscious, certainly further than our love for ourselves.</p>
<p>As to their objection<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_313_1" id="target_note_LCL141_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> that most men get no relief from words of comfort, and the additional one, that the comforters themselves admit that they are wretched when fortune has shifted her attack to them, each statement admits of refutation. For the fault here is not nature’s, the blame rests with us; and the folly<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_313_2" id="target_note_LCL141_313_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of it you may attack as much as you like. For both those who get no relief are wretched by their own invitation, and those, who bear their own misfortunes in a spirit different from that which they have themselves advocated in the case of others, are not worse than, as a rule, many avaricious men who censure the avaricious, or ambitious men who censure the ambitious; for it is a peculiarity of folly to discern the faults of others and be forgetful of its own. But beyond question, since it is agreed that distress is removed by long continuance, the chief proof<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_313_3" id="target_note_LCL141_313_3"><sup>3</sup></a> is the fact that it is not the mere lapse of time that produces this effect, but continued reflection. For if the circumstances are the same and the person is the same, how can there be any change in the grief felt, if there is no change either in the reason for the grief or in the person who feels it? Continued reflection therefore that there is no evil in the circumstances has a healing effect upon pain, not the continuance of time alone.</p>
<p>XXXI. At this point they confront me with their “mean”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_313_4" id="target_note_LCL141_313_4"><sup>4</sup></a> states. If these are based upon nature, what need is there of giving comfort? For nature will herself fix the limit; but if they are based on belief, then let the belief be completely set aside.
