as a man,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_375_1" id="target_note_LCL141_375_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and to what we call mildness,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_375_2" id="target_note_LCL141_375_2"><sup>2</sup></a> they apply the term indifference with a bad meaning. And indeed they do not only praise lust of this sort (for anger is as I defined it lately the lust of vengeance),<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_375_3" id="target_note_LCL141_375_3"><sup>3</sup></a> but they say that this selfsame kind of emotion, call it lust<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_375_4a" id="target_note_LCL141_375_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> or desire, has been bestowed by nature for purposes of the highest utility; for no one is able to do anything really well except he has a lust for it. Themistocles walked by night in a public place because he was, he said, unable to sleep, and in answer to questions replied that he was kept awake by the trophies of Miltiades. Who has not heard of the sleeplessness of Demosthenes? who said that he was grieved if ever he had been beaten by the diligence of workmen rising before the break of day. Lastly the leaders of philosophy itself would never have been able to make such prodigious advance in their studies without a fiery longing. We have been told that Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato journeyed to the ends of the earth; for they judged it their duty to go where there was something to be learnt, whatever it might be. We cannot think, can we, that this would have been possible without deep and passionate longing?</p>
<p>XX. As for distress itself, which we have said is to be shunned as an abominable and savage monster, they say it has been provided by nature not without considerable advantage, in order that mankind if guilty of trespass should feel pain at incurring correction, censure and disgrace. For escape from the penalty of trespasses seems granted to those who endure disgrace and shame without pain; it is better
