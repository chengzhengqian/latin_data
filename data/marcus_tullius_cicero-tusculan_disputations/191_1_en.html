could not be so sure of L. Brutus; it may be that unbounded hatred of the tyrant<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_383_1" id="target_note_LCL141_383_1"><sup>1</sup></a> made him dash more impetuously upon Arruns; for I see that each of them fell by a wound from the hand of the other. Why then do you bring in anger here? Is it that bravery has no impulses of its own unless it begins to lose its wits? Again, do you think that Hercules, who was raised to heaven by that selfsame bravery you would have to be irascibility, was angry when he struggled with the boar of Erymanthus or the lion of Nemea? or Theseus too when he gripped the horns of the bull of Marathon? Have a care lest bravery contain no jot of frenzy, and irascibility be wholly trumpery; for there is no bravery that is devoid of reason.</p>
<p>XXIII. The chances of mortal life are to be despised, death is to be disregarded, pains and toils are to be considered endurable. When such principles have been established by judgment and thought, then appears the strong and steady bravery we are looking for, unless, it may be, our notion is that acts done in an impetuous, fiery and high-spirited way are done in a mood of irascibility. To my mind even that Scipio,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_383_2" id="target_note_LCL141_383_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the chief pontiff, who verified the truth of the Stoic maxim that the wise man is never out of office, does not seem to have been angry with Tiberius Gracchus when he left the spiritless consul and, though himself holding no official position, called, as though he were consul, upon all who desired the safety of the commonwealth to follow him. I cannot say whether I myself have acted bravely in public life: if ever I have so acted, assuredly I have not acted in anger. Or is there anything more like unsoundness of mind than anger?
