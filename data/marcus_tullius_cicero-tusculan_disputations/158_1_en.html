comfort is to remove from the mind of the mourner the belief already described, in case he should think he is discharging a regular duty which is obligatory. There are some too in favour of concentrating all these ways of administering comfort (for one man is influenced in one way, one in another) pretty nearly as in my <span class="italic">Consolation</span> I threw them all into one attempt at consolation; for my soul was in a feverish state and I attempted every means of curing its condition.</p>
<p>But it is necessary in dealing with diseases of the soul, just as much as in dealing with bodily diseases, to choose the proper time, as was shown by the famous Prometheus, who after the words</p>

The first remedial step therefore in giving comfort will be to show that either there is no evil or very little; the second will be to discuss the common lot of life and any special feature that needs discussion in the lot of the individual mourner; the third will be to show that it is utter folly to be uselessly overcome by sorrow when one realizes that there is no possible advantage. For Cleanthes<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_317_2a" id="target_note_LCL141_317_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> comforts the “wise man” who does not want comfort.
