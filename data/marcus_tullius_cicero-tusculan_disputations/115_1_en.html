endure: never does it cease to desire;” and to say nothing of others, what bodily diseases can be more serious, pray, than these two diseases of distress and desire? And then how can we accept the notion that the soul cannot heal itself, seeing that the soul has discovered the actual art of healing the body, and seeing that men’s constitutions of themselves, as well as nature, contribute a good deal to the cure of the body, and not all of those who have submitted to treatment succeed at once in making recovery as well,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_231_1" id="target_note_LCL141_231_1"><sup>1</sup></a> whereas we see, on the contrary, that souls which have been ready to be cured and have obeyed the instructions of wise men, are undoubtedly cured?
