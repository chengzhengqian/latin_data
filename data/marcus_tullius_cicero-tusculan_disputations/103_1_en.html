need? He will brace and strengthen and commune with himself by saying, “Beware of anything base, slack, unmanly.” Let the ideals which a true man honours be kept constantly before his eyes: let him call up the image of Zeno of Elea<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_207_1" id="target_note_LCL141_207_1"><sup>1</sup></a> who endured every torment rather than be brought to divulge his accomplices in the plot to overthrow tyranny; let him reflect on the story of Anaxarchus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_207_2" id="target_note_LCL141_207_2"><sup>2</sup></a> the follower of Democritus, who fell into the power of King Timocreon in Cyprus, and without appealing for mercy recoiled from no form of torture. Callanus the Indian,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_207_3" id="target_note_LCL141_207_3"><sup>3</sup></a> an untutored savage, born at the foot of the Caucasus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_207_4" id="target_note_LCL141_207_4"><sup>4</sup></a> of his own free-will was burnt alive. We, on the contrary, cannot bear a pain in the foot, or a toothache (but suppose the whole body is in pain); the reason is that there is a kind of womanish and frivolous way of thinking exhibited in pleasure as much as in pain, which makes our self-control melt and stream away through weakness, and so we cannot endure a bee-sting without crying out. But as a matter of fact C. Marius, a countryman by extraction yet undoubtedly a man, when under the surgeon’s knife, as I related earlier,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_207_5" id="target_note_LCL141_207_5"><sup>5</sup></a> refused from the outset to be bound, and there is no record of anyone before Marius having been operated on without being tied up. Why then did others afterwards do like him? It was the force of example. Do you see then that evil is a creature of the imagination, not a reality of nature? And yet the same Marius showed that the sting of the pain was severe, for he did not offer his other leg; thus being a man he bore pain, being human he refused to bear greater pain without actual necessity. The whole point then is to be master of yourself.</p>
