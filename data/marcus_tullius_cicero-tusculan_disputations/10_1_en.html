<p>A. Now I recognise the Greek. But since you compelled me to admit that the dead were not wretched, go on if you can to make me think that to have to die is not wretchedness either. M. Surely that is no serious undertaking, I have greater aims in view. A. How no serious matter? Or what do you mean by the greater aims you speak of? M. Because, inasmuch as after death there is no evil, death, which is at once succeeded by time in which by your admission there is no evil, is not an evil either: it follows that to have to die is not an evil either, for it means having to reach a condition which we admit is not an evil. A. Explain more fully, I beg; for your last remarks are somewhat intricate and compel me to agree before I am convinced. But what do you mean by the greater aims you have in view? M. To show you if I can that death is not merely no evil but positively a good. A. I do not ask so much as that, all the same I am eager to hear it: for though you may not succeed in your wish, still you will succeed in showing that death is not an evil. But I shall not interrupt you: I wish to hear a continuous speech. M. What? If I put a question to you, will you make no reply? A. That would be discourteous: but I prefer you to refrain from questions except where necessary.</p>
