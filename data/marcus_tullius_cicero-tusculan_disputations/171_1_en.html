subject to the influence of present evil; fools are subject to distress and feel its influence in the face of expected evil, and their souls are downcast and shrunken together in disobedience to reason. And consequently the first definition of distress is that it is a shrinking together<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_343_1" id="target_note_LCL141_343_1"><sup>1</sup></a> of the soul in conflict with reason. Thus there are four <span class="italic">disorders</span>, three <span class="italic">equable states</span>,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_343_2" id="target_note_LCL141_343_2"><sup>2</sup></a> since there is no equable state in opposition to distress.</p>

Consequently they define them more precisely, that it may be realized not only how wrong they are but to what extent they are under our control. <span class="italic">Distress</span> then is a newly formed belief of present evil, the subject of which thinks it right to feel depression and shrinking of soul; <span class="italic">delight</span> is a newly formed belief of present good, and the subject of it thinks it right to feel enraptured; <span class="italic">fear</span> is a belief of threatening evil which seems to the subject of it insupportable; <span class="italic">lust</span> is a belief of prospective good and the subject of this thinks it advantageous to possess it at once upon the spot. But they do not think that only the disorders depend upon the judgments and beliefs from which disorders, as I have said, come, but that on them also depend the results of the disorders; and so it is that distress results in some sting as it were of pain, fear in a kind of withdrawal and flight of the soul, delight in extravagant gaiety, lust in unbridled longing. Moreover the <span class="italic">act of belief</span> which we have included in all previous definitions they hold to be a weak acquiescence.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_343_3" id="target_note_LCL141_343_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
