wisdom is indeed out of harmony with itself, as long as it is unwise, but it is not distorted or perverse.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_359_1a" id="target_note_LCL141_359_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Disease, however, and sickness are subdivisions of defectiveness, but it is a question whether disorders are subdivisions of the same class. For defects are permanent dispositions, but disorders are shifting, so that they cannot be subdivisions of permanent dispositions. Moreover as in evil the analogy of the body extends to the nature of the soul, so it does in good. For the chief blessings of the body are beauty, strength, health, vigour, agility; so are they of the soul. For as in the body the adjustment of the various parts, of which we are made up, in their fitting relation to one another is health, so health of the soul means a condition when its judgments and beliefs are in harmony, and such health of soul is virtue, which some say is temperance alone,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_359_2" id="target_note_LCL141_359_2"><sup>2</sup></a> others a condition obedient to the dictates of temperance and following close upon it and without specific difference, but whether it be the one or the other, it exists, they say, in the wise man only.

Cicero seems to be distinguishing between two states of moral defect, the one a “habit,” the other a “disposition.” Both are due to perversion of belief, but vicious “habit” means depravity, vicious “disposition” means only inconsistency, sometimes more, sometimes less. A “disposition” by long indulgence can become a “habit.” When Dr. Johnson was urged by Hannah More to take a little wine, “I can’t take a little, child,” he answered; “therefore I never touch it,” for he did not intend the “disposition” to become a “habit.” On the other hand Johnson declared himself “a hardened and shameless tea-drinker,” for “disposition” had been allowed to become “habit.” Horace recognizes the distinction between the man who has the “habit” of vice and who rejoices in iniquity, and the man who has the “disposition” to vice but is at war with himself, Sat. II. 7. 6:
