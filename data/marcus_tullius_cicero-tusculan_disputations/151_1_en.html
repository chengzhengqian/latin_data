force them to shed tears. What is the meaning of this? When actual cessation of sorrow has ensued and it is thus realized that nothing is gained by mourning, do not the facts of the case show that it is entirely a matter of will? What does the self-tormenting character—in Greek ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος—say in Terence?</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">Chremes, at heart I am convinced I do</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">My boy less wrong so long as I’m unhappy.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL141_303_1" id="target_note_LCL141_303_1"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p class="noindent">He esteems himself “worthy of ill” if he be not “miserable?” You see therefore that evil comes from belief, not from nature.
