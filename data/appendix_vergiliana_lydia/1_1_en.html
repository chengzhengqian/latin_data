<p>I envy you, ye fields and lovely meadows, for this more lovely that in you my lovely girl sighs silently for my love. It is you she now sees, in you my Lydia plays, it is you she now addresses, on you she now turns her smiling eyes, hums my songs with voice subdued, and meanwhile sings those strains she used to sing into my ear.</p>
<p>I envy you, ye fields; you will learn to love. O too, too happy fields, yea, often blest, in which she will print the steps of her snowy feet, or with rosy fingers will pluck the green grape (for the little vine swells not yet with nectarous juice), or amid the coloured flowers, tribute to Venus, she will lay down her limbs and crush the tender grass, and all alone will stealthily recount the tale of my love. The woods will rejoice, the soft meadows and cool springs will rejoice, and the birds will keep silent. The gliding brooks will pause (halt, ye waters!) while my heart sets forth its fond complaints.</p>
<p>I envy you, ye fields; you possess what gives me joy, and now you have her, who before was my delight. But my dying limbs are wasting with grief, and warmth fails me,</p>
