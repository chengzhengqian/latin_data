blue cloud kindles with the sun’s rays and gleams afar; then the smooth greaves of electrum and refined gold, the spear, and the shield’s ineffable fabric.</p>
<p>There the story of Italy and the triumphs of Rome had the Lord of Fire fashioned, not unversed in prophecy or unknowing of the age to come; there, every generation of the stock to spring from Ascanius, and the wars they fought in their sequence. He had fashioned, too, the mother wolf lying stretched out in the green cave of Mars; around her teats the twin boys hung playing, and suckled their dam without fear; with shapely neck bent back, she fondled them by turns, and moulded their limbs with her tongue. Not far from here he had set Rome and the Sabine maidens, lawlessly carried off, when the great Circus games were held, from the theatre’s seated throng; then the sudden uprising of a fresh war between the sons of Romulus and aged Tatius and his stern Cures. Next, the same kings, their strife laid at rest, stood armed before Jove’s altar, cup in hand, and made covenant with each other over sacrifice of swine, and the palace was rough, fresh with the thatch of Romulus. Not far from there, four-horse chariots, driven apart, had torn Mettus asunder (but you, Alban, should have stood by your words!), and Tullus dragged the liar’s body through the woods, and the brambles dripped with dew of blood. There, too, was Porsenna, bidding them admit the banished Tarquin, and oppressing the city with mighty siege: the sons of Aeneas rushing on the sword for freedom’s sake. You could see him shown as angry, as threatening, because Cocles dared to tear down the bridge, and Cloelia broke her bonds and swam the river.</p>
