Swifter than the East Wind he flies, as soon as he sees an unknown hilt in his defenceless hand. They say that in his headlong haste, when first mounting behind his yoked horses for battle, he left his fatherâ€™s blade behind and in his haste snatched up the sword of Metiscus his charioteer; and for long that served, while the straggling Teucrians turned their backs; but when it met the god-wrought armour of Vulcan, the mortal blade, like brittle ice, flew asunder at the stroke; the fragments glitter on the yellow sand. So Turnus madly flees this way and that over the plain, and now in one direction and now in another he entwines wavering circles; for on all sides the Teucrians enclosed him in a crowded ring, and on one side a waste fen, on another steep ramparts hem him in.</p>

Then indeed a din breaks out; the banks and pools around make answer, and all heaven thunders with the tumult. Even as he flees, even then Turnus upbraids all the Rutulians, calling each by name, and clamouring for the sword he knows. Aeneas
