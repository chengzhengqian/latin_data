<p>Trojan Aeneas, who has sent us to your doors. How fierce the storm that burst from cruel Mycenae and passed over the plains of Ida; how, driven by fate, the two worlds of Europe and Asia clashed—this has come to the ears of all whom the farthest land where Ocean is flung back keeps far away, and of all whom the zone of the tyrannous sun, stretched in the middle of the four, severs from us.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL064_19_12" id="target_note_LCL064_19_12">

</a> From that deluge we have sailed over many waste seas, and now crave a scant home for our country’s gods, a harmless landing place, and air and water free to all. We shall be no shame to the realm, nor shall your renown be lightly told or the grace of such a deed grow faint, nor shall Ausonia repent of having welcomed Troy to her breast. By the fortunes of Aeneas I swear, and by his right hand, found strong when any tested it for loyalty or in war and arms: many are the peoples, many the nations—scorn us not, that of ourselves we proffer garlands with our hands and address to you words of suppliance—who have sought us for themselves and craved our alliance; but the will of heaven has forced us by its behests to seek out your shores. From here Dardanus came forth, hither Apollo calls us back and with high decrees urges us to Tuscan Tiber and the sacred waters of the Numician spring. Further, to you our king offers these poor tokens of his former fortune—relics snatched from burning Troy. With this gold did his father Anchises pour libation at the altars; this was Priam’s array when after his wont he gave laws to the assembled nations—the sceptre, the sacred diadem, and the robes wrought by Ilium’s daughters. . . .”</p>
