<p>Still more! When life’s last ray has fled, the wretches are not entirely freed from all evil and all the plagues of the body; and it needs must be that many a taint, long ingrained, should in wondrous wise become deeply rooted in their being. Therefore are they schooled with punishments, and pay penance for bygone sins. Some are hung stretched out to the empty winds; from others the stain of guilt is washed away under swirling floods or burned out by fire till length of days, when time’s cycle is complete, has removed the inbred taint and leaves unsoiled the ethereal sense and pure flame of spirit: each of us undergoes his own purgatory. Then we are sent to spacious Elysium, a few of us to possess the blissful fields. All these that you see, when they have rolled time’s wheel through a thousand years, the god summons in vast throng to Lethe’s river, so that, their memories effaced, they may once more revisit the vault above and conceive the desire of return to the body.”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL063_585_35a" id="target_note_LCL063_585_35a">

The passage is quite clear but since editors and commentators fail to realize the dislocation of 743f (for which Varius may be responsible), they are faced with an impossible task in explaining a text in which purgatory comes after entry into paradise.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL063_585_35a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
