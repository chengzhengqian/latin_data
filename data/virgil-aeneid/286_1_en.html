Then, weary of dragging out so many delays, of plucking out so many weapons, and hard pressed in the unequal fray, at last with much pondering at heart, he bursts out and hurls his lance full between the war horse’s hollow temples. The steed rears up, lashes the air with its feet, then throws the rider and itself coming down from above, entangles him; then falls on him in headlong plunge, and with shoulder out of joint.
