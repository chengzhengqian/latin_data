<p>So cries the maiden and with fleet foot, swift as lightning, she crosses the horse’s path and, seizing the reins, meets him face to face and takes vengeance from his hated blood: as lightly as a falcon, bird of augury,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL064_287_16" id="target_note_LCL064_287_16">

<p>But with not unseeing eyes the father of gods and men sits throned on high Olympus, viewing the scene. He rouses Tyrrhenian Tarchon to the fierce battle, and fills him with wrath by no gentle spur. So, amid the slaughter and wavering columns, Tarchon rides, and goads his squadrons with diverse cries, calling each man by name, and rallying the routed to the fight. “You Tuscans, who will never be stung by shame, sluggards always, what fear, what utter cowardice has fallen on your hearts? Does a woman drive you in disorder and rout your ranks? For what reason do we bear swords, why these idle weapons, in our hands? But you are not laggard for love and nightly frays, or when the curved flute proclaims the Bacchic dance. Wait for the feasts and the cups on the loaded board (this is your passion, this your delight!) till the favouring seer announces the sacrifice, and the fat victim calls you to the deep groves!” So saying, he spurs his horse into the throng, ready himself also to die, and charges like a whirlwind full at Venulus; tearing the foe from his horse, he grips him with his right hand, clasps him to his breast, and, mightily spurring on his horse, carries him off. A shout rises to heaven, as all the Latins turned their eyes on the sight.</p>
