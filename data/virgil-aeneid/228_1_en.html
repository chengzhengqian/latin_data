crimson crest guards his head. “Men, is there anyone who with me will be first against the foe? See!” he cries, and whirling a javelin sends it skyward to start the battle and advances proudly over the plain. His comrades greet him with a shout, and follow with dreadful din; they marvel at the Teucrians’ craven hearts, crying: “They cannot trust themselves to a fair field, or face the foe in arms, but hug the camp.” Back and forth he rides wildly round the walls, seeking entrance where way is none. And as when a wolf, lying in wait at a crowded fold, growls beside the pens at midnight, enduring winds and rains; safe beneath their mothers the lambs keepbleating; fierce and reckless in his wrath, he rages against the prey beyond his reach, tormented by the long-gathering fury of famine, and by his dry, bloodless jaws; just so, as he scans wall and camp, the Rutulian’s wrath is aflame; resentment is hot within his iron bones. By what device can he attempt entrance? By what path hurl the penned Teucrians from their rampart, and pour them out over the plain? Close to the side of the camplay the fleet, fenced about with mounds and the flowing river; he attacks it, calling to his exulting comrades for fire, and in hot haste fills his hand with a blazing pine. Then indeed they fall to, spurred on by Turnus’ presence, and all the band arm themselves with murky torches. They have stripped the hearths; smoking brands fling a pitchy glare, and the Fire God carries the sooty cloud to heaven.</p>
<p>What god, Muses, turned such fierce flames from the Teucrians? Who drove such vast fires away from the ships? Tell me; faith in the tale is old, but its fame is everlasting.</p>
