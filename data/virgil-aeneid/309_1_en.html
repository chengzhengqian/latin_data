the shallows retreat. Twice the Tuscans drove the routed Rutulians to the city; twice, repulsed, they glance backwards, as they sling behind them their protecting shields. But when, clashing in the third encounter, the lines stood interlocked along their whole length, and man marked man, then in truth there were groans of the dying, and arms and bodies and horses, dying and mingled with slaughtered riders, all weltering deep in blood: the fight swells fiercely. Orsilochus hurled a lance at Remulus’ steed—for he feared to meet its lord—and left the steel beneath its ear. At this blow the charger rears furious and, unable to bear the wound, with chest raised flings his legs on high; unseated, Remulus rolls on the ground. Catillus strikes down Iollas, and Herminius, giant in courage, giant in body and arms; on his bare head stream his tawny locks, and bare are his shoulders; for him wounds have no terrors; so vast a frame faces the steel. Through his broad shoulders the driven spear comes quivering and, piercing through, bends him double with pain. Everywhere the dark blood streams; they deal carnage, clashing with the sword, and seek a glorious death among the wounds.</p>
<p>But in the heart of the slaughter, like an Amazon, one breast bared for the fray, and girt with a quiver, rages Camilla; and now she showers tough javelins thick from her hand, now she snatches a stout battle axe with unwearied grasp; the golden bow, armour of Diana, clangs from her shoulders. And even when, pressed from behind, she withdraws, she turns her bow and aims arrows in her flight. And round her are her chosen comrades, the maiden Larina, and Tulla, and Tarpeia, wielding an axe of bronze, daughters of Italy, whom godlike Camilla herself chose to be her glory, good handmaids in both peace and war.
