our walls. My countrymen, we are waging an ill-omened war with a race divine, with men unconquered; no battles weary them and even in defeat they cannot let go the sword. If you had any hope in alliance with Aetolian arms, resign it. Each is his own hope; but you see how slender this is. As for the rest of your fortunes, it is before your eyes, and all is in your grasp, in what wide ruin they lie smitten. I do not blame anyone; what valour’s utmost could do is done; we have striven with our realm’s whole strength. Now mark: the judgment of my wavering mind I will unfold and, if you pay heed, will instruct you in brief. There is an ancient domain of mine bordering the Tuscan river, stretching far westward, even beyond Sicanian bounds. Auruncans and Rutulians sow the seed, work the stubborn hills with the plough and graze their roughest slopes. Let all this tract, with a pine-clad belt of mountain height, pass to the Trojans in friendship; let us name just terms of treaty, and invite them to share our realm. Let them settle, if their desire is so strong, and build their city. But if they have a mind to lay hold of other territories and another nation, and can leave our soil, let us build twice ten ships of Italian oak; or, if they can man more, all the timber lies at the water’s edge; let them prescribe the number and design of their vessels themselves; let us contribute bronze, labour, and docks. Further, to bring the news and seal the pact, I would have a hundred envoys go forth, Latins of noblest birth, holding boughs of peace in their hands, and carrying gifts—talent-weights of gold and ivory, and a throne and robe, signs of our royalty. Take counsel together and restore our weary fortunes!”</p>
