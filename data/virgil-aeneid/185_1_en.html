spray; she becomes Calybe, aged priestess of Juno and her temple, and with these words presents herself to the young man’s eyes: “Turnus, will you endure all these labours spent in vain, and sceptre transferred to Dardan settlers? The king denies you your bride and the dowry your blood has won, and a stranger is sought as heir to your throne. So go now, confront thankless perils, scorned as you are: go, lay low the Tuscan ranks; shield the Latins with peace. This it was that Saturn’s almighty daughter in person bade me say to you as you were lying in the stillness of night. Rise then, and gladly make ready the arming of your men, and their march from the gates into the fields. Burn the Phrygian chiefs, who are anchored in our fair stream, burn their painted ships. The mighty force of the gods commands. Let King Latinus himself, unless he consents to give you your bride and stand by his word, know of it, and at last make proof of Turnus as a foe.”</p>

But you, mother, old age, enfeebled by decay and barren of truth, frets with vain distress, and amid the feuds of kings mocks your prophetic soul with false alarms. Your charge it is to keepthe gods’ images and temples; war and peace men shall wield, whose work war is.”</p>
