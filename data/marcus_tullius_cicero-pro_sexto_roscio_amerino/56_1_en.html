time that it has occurred to me to say so. You will remember that, at the beginning of my speech, I divided the case as follows: the charge—the duty of proving this has been left entirely to Erucius; audacity—the rôle of which has been assigned to the Roscii. Whatever misdeed, crime, or murder shall be found, will have to be assigned to them as their own.
