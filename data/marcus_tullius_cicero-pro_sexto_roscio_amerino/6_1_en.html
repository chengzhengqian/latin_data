open crimes and daily bloodshed. The vehement<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>
appeal which accusers are accustomed to make in other trials, we, the accused, make to-day. We ask Marcus Fannius, and you, gentlemen, to punish crimes with the utmost severity, to resist the most audacious of men with all your courage, and to bear in mind that, unless you show the real spirit by which you are animated, human passion, villainy, and audacity are likely to break bounds to such an extent that murders will be committed, not only in secret, but even here in the forum before your tribunal, Marcus Fannius, at your feet, gentlemen of the jury, and amidst the benches themselves on which you sit. For what is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">13</span><span class="br"></span>
the aim of this trial, if not that murder may be committed with impunity? They are the accusers, who have laid hands upon the property of my client, he is the defendant, to whom they have left nothing but ruin; they are the accusers, who profited by the murder of my client’s father, he is the defendant, to whom his father’s death brought not only sorrow, but also poverty; they are the accusers, who passionately desired to murder my client, he is the defendant who is obliged to present himself even before this tribunal with an escort, for fear he may be killed in this very same spot before your eyes; lastly, they are the accusers, whose trial the people demands, he is the defendant, who is the sole survivor of their infamous massacre.</p>
<p>And that you may more readily understand, gentlemen,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">14</span><span class="br"></span>
that the actual deeds are more outrageous than my description of them, we will put before you the course of events from the beginning; you will then find it easier to appreciate the misfortunes of this completely innocent man, the audacity of his enemies, and the deplorable condition of the State.</p>
