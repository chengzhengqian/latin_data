this one point only, which your manifest guilt and the evidence of the facts supply me with: where and from whom did Glaucia hear of the murder? how did he come to know it so quickly? Admit that he heard of it at once; what forced him to make so long a journey in a hurry in a single night? what pressing necessity obliged him, if he was going to Ameria of his own accord, to set out from Rome at such an hour, and spend a sleepless night?</p>
