whether new or old, I ask by what right, in what manner, or by virtue of what law were his goods sold.</p>

<p>XLIV. Do you ask, against whom my words are<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">127</span><span class="br"></span> directed? Not against him whom you desire and think them to be, for my own speech from the very beginning and his own eminent virtue at all times have exonerated Sulla. I assert that all this is the work of Chrysogonus—that he lied, that he pretended that Sextus Roscius was a bad citizen, that he said that he had been slain among Sulla’s enemies, that he prevented Sulla being informed about these matters by the deputies from Ameria. Lastly, I even suspect that this property has not been sold at all, as I will afterwards show, gentlemen, if you allow me to do so.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_237_a" id="target_note_LCL240_237_a"><sup>a</sup></a></p>
<p>Now I believe that the latest date on which proscriptions<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">128</span><span class="br"></span> and sales may take place is stated in the law—namely, the first of June. Some months afterwards Roscius was slain and his property is said to have been sold. In any case, either this sale was not entered on the public registers, and we are being cheated by this rascal more cleverly than we think, or, if it was, the registers have been tampered with in some way, for it is evident that the property could not have been sold by virtue of the law. I am aware, gentlemen, that I am examining this question prematurely and that I am almost on the wrong road, in that while I ought to be trying to save my client’s life, I am treating a whitlow. For he is not worried about money; he takes no account of his own interest; he thinks that he will easily endure his poverty, provided he is freed from this unworthy suspicion and false accusation. But I beg, gentlemen,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">129</span><span class="br"></span> that you will listen to the few things I have yet to say with the feeling that I am speaking partly for myself,
