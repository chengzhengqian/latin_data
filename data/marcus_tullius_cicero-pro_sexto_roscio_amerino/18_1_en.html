such an act of madness as that to Sextus Roscius? “His father disliked him,” says the accuser. His father disliked him? why? There must have been a valid, strong, and obvious reason, for it is as improbable that a son should be hated by his father without many strong and cogent reasons, as it is incredible that death should be inflicted upon a father by his son unless he had numerous and weighty motives for the act.
