<p>VI. Sextus Roscius, my clientâ€™s father, was a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
citizen of the free town of Ameria<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_135_a" id="target_note_LCL240_135_a"><sup>a</sup></a>; by birth, descent, and fortune he was easily the chief man, not only in his own town, but also in the neighbourhood, while his influence and relations of hospitality with those of the highest rank enhanced his reputation. For he not only enjoyed relations of hospitality<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_135_ba" id="target_note_LCL240_135_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> with the Metelli, Servilii, and Scipios, but also private intercourse and intimacy with those families, whose names I mention with the respect due to their high character and dignity. Well, then, of all the advantages of his position this was the only one which he bequeathed to his son, whose inheritance is in the hands of brigands belonging to his family, who have seized it by force, while the honour and life of the innocent son are defended by the guests and friends of the father. Since the latter had always supported<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">16</span><span class="br"></span>
the nobles, especially in the latest disturbances,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_135_c" id="target_note_LCL240_135_c"><sup>c</sup></a> when the position and safety of all persons of distinction were in danger, he, more than anyone else in the neighbourhood, defended their party and upheld their cause by his efforts, zeal, and influence. In fact, he thought it his duty to fight for the honour of those to whom he owed it that he was reckoned a most honourable man among his fellow-citizens. After their victory had been established and we were no longer at war, when proscription was rife and those who were supposed to have belonged to the opposite party were being seized in every quarter, he was constantly in Rome, and showed himself every day in the forum before the eyes of all, as if he were triumphing
