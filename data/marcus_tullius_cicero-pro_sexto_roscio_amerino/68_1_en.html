have enough defenders and to spare; but if, in consideration of the greatness of the injustice, and of the fact that the highest interests of the State are being attacked in the peril by which he is threatened—if all were to punish these acts, by Hercules! you would not be allowed to stand where you are. As it is, the conditions under which he is now defended are certainly not such as ought to annoy our opponents, or make them think that they are being defeated by superior power. As for his domestic affairs, they<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">149</span><span class="br"></span> are looked after by Caecilia; the conduct of his affairs in the forum and in court, as you see, gentlemen, has been undertaken by Messalla.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_257_a" id="target_note_LCL240_257_a"><sup>a</sup></a> If he were old and strong enough, he would plead himself for Sextus Roscius; but since his youth and his modesty, which is an ornament to it, prevent him from speaking, he has entrusted the cause to me, who he knew desired and was under an obligation to undertake it in his interest. Personally, by his constant presence in court, his advice, influence, and unwearied attention, he succeeded in rescuing the life of Sextus Roscius from the hands of the brokers and getting it left to the verdict of his judges. There can be no doubt, gentlemen, that most of the citizens took up arms for such nobles as Messalla; their object was that these nobles should be restored to their rights as citizens who were ready to do what you see Messalla doing—defend the civil existence of an innocent man, resist injustice, and show the extent of their power in saving rather than ruining their fellow-men. If all those who have been born in the same rank were to do this, the State would have less to suffer from them, and they themselves would suffer less from the jealousy with which they are regarded.</p>
