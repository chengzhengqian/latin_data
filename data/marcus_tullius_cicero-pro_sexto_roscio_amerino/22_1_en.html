an absurd accuser if you had been born in the times when men were summoned from the plough to be made consuls. For, seeing that you think it a crime to superintend the cultivation of the land, you would assuredly have considered the well-known Atilius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_165_a" id="target_note_LCL240_165_a"><sup>a</sup></a> whom the deputation found sowing his field with his own hand, a most base and dishonourable man.
