which I can prove was written for him by Erucius—the roll which he is said to have flourished in the face of Sextus Roscius, with the threat that he would state all the facts contained in it as evidence. What an admirable witness, gentlemen! a weighty authority who deserves all your attention! an honourable character, to whose evidence you should be ready to adapt your verdict! Assuredly, we should not see so clearly into these men’s crimes, unless they themselves were rendered blind by greed and avarice and audacity.</p>
