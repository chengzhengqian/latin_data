which you are unable to prove,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_193_a" id="target_note_LCL240_193_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or by the agency of others, free men or slaves. Free men? You are unable to show how he was able to meet them, by what means he persuaded them, where, by whose agency, what expectations he raised, what bribe he offered. I, on the contrary, prove that Sextus Roscius not only did not do, but could not have done, any of these things, seeing that for several years he had neither been in Rome nor had ever left his farm without good reason. It seems that the only thing left to you was to name the slaves; this appeared a kind of harbour where you might take refuge when driven from your other false allegations, instead of which you have struck upon such a sort of rock that you not only see the charge rebound from Sextus Roscius, but also understand that every suspicion recoils upon yourselves.</p>

What do you say? men were killed as an ordinary occurrence? through whom and by whom? Do you not remember that those who brought you here were the purchasers of confiscated goods? What next? Do we not know that, during the times you mention, cut-throats and cut-purses
