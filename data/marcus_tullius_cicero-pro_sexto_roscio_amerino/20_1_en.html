sons, he never sent one of them away, but left the other to live in the country. I beg you, Erucius, to take what I am going to say in good part, for I do not mean to reproach you, but to remind you. If it has<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">46</span><span class="br"></span>
not been your lot to be born of a father about whom there is no mistake,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_161_a" id="target_note_LCL240_161_a"><sup>a</sup></a> from whom you could have learnt what was the feeling of a father towards his children, at least nature has given you no small share of humanity, combined with a taste for learning, so that you are not a stranger to literature. To take an example from the stage, I ask you whether you really think that the old man in the play of Caecilius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_161_b" id="target_note_LCL240_161_b"><sup>b</sup></a> thinks less of Eutychus, who lives in the country, than of the other, Chaerestratus (I think that was his name); that he keeps the one with him in the city as a token of esteem, while he has sent the other into the country as a punishment. “Why go<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">47</span><span class="br"></span>
off into such irrelevancies?” you will say. As if it would be difficult for me—without “going off” very far—to bring forward by name as many as you please of my fellow-tribesmen or neighbours, who desire that their favourite sons should devote themselves to agriculture! But it is a breach of good manners to take as examples men who are well known,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_161_c" id="target_note_LCL240_161_c"><sup>c</sup></a> since it is uncertain whether they would like their names to be given; besides, none of them is likely to be better known to you than Eutychus, and certainly it makes no difference to the argument, whether I quote the name of this young man in the comedy or of anyone from the territory of Veii.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_161_da" id="target_note_LCL240_161_da"><sup>d</sup></a> I think, in fact, that these fictions of the poets are intended to give us a representation of our manners in the characters of others
