But, as I said before, it is my intention to pass lightly over and only touch upon each question, that everyone may understand that I am not making an accusation from inclination, but from a sense of duty to my client.</p>

<p>XXXIII. I see, then, that there were many<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">92</span><span class="br"></span>
motives that might have driven him to commit the crime. Let us now see whether he had any opportunity of doing so. Where was Sextus Roscius killed? “At Rome.” Well, where were you at that time, Titus Roscius? “At Rome. But what has that to do with it? Many others were there as well.” As if the present question were to find out who, out of so great a number, committed the crime, and not rather whether it is more probable that Roscius was killed by one who at the time was constantly in Rome, or by one who for many years had not been near Rome at all.</p>
<p>Well, then, let us consider what other opportunities<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">93</span><span class="br"></span>
he had. As Erucius has told us, at that time there was a crowd of assassins, and men were killed with impunity. Well, of whom was this crowd composed? I imagine either of those who were occupied in buying properties,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_205_a" id="target_note_LCL240_205_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or of those who were hired by them to murder somebody. If you think the criminals were those who coveted the property of others, you are one of the number, you who are enriched by our wealth; but if you think they were those who are called by the milder name of bandits, inquire under whose protection, whose dependants they are, and believe me, you will find one of your associates. Whatever you may say to the contrary, compare it with my defence, and so it will be very easy to contrast the case of Sextus Roscius with your own.
