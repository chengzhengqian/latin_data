a Memmius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_203_a" id="target_note_LCL240_203_a"><sup>a</sup></a> already withdrawn by age from the field<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_203_b" id="target_note_LCL240_203_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; last of all, the aged Priam himself, Antistius.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_203_ca" id="target_note_LCL240_203_ca"><sup>c</sup></a> prohibited from fighting, not only by his age, but also by the laws. Further, there are hundreds whose name is never mentioned owing to their obscurity, who acted as accusers in cases of murder and poisoning. As far as I am concerned, I could wish that they were all living. For there is no harm in there being as many dogs as possible where there are many people to be watched and many things to be guarded. But,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">91</span><span class="br"></span>
as generally happens, the violence and turmoil of war bring many acts in their train unknown to the generals. While he who wielded the supreme power was occupied with other matters, there were some who in the meantime were attending to their own wounds<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_203_d" id="target_note_LCL240_203_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; these people, as if eternal night had enveloped the republic, rushed about in the darkness and threw everything into confusion. I am surprised that they did not also burn the benches, to prevent any trace of judicial proceedings being left; for they put both accusers and jurymen out of the way. But fortunately they led such a life that they could not have destroyed all the witnesses, even if they had so desired; for as long as the human race exists, there will be no lack of men to accuse them; as long as the State lasts, trials will take place. But, as I have said above, if Erucius had such facts as I have mentioned to support him in a case, he would be able to speak on them as long as he pleased, and I can do the same.
