As for the rest of the property, this Titus Roscius, as he himself says, seized it in the name of Chrysogonus. This property, valued at 6,000,000 sesterces, was bought for 2000 sesterces. I am convinced, gentlemen, that all this took place without Sulla’s knowledge. For<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span>
at the time when he is repairing the past and preparing for the possible emergencies of the future; when he alone possesses the means of establishing peace and the power of waging war; when all eyes are fixed upon him alone, and he alone is absolute ruler; when he is distracted by so many and such important affairs that he cannot even breathe freely, we ought not to be surprised if something escapes his notice, especially as so many are on the look-out for the time when he is busy and are watching for an opportunity, as soon as he is off his guard, to start some such plan as this. Add to this that, although he is “fortunate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_141_c" id="target_note_LCL240_141_c"><sup>c</sup></a>” as he really is, no one can be so fortunate as not to have

The <span class="italic">lex Cornelia de proscriptione</span> contained certain alterations in detail, such as that the goods of the proscribed and of those who fell in the enemy’s army should be sold for the benefit of the State and their sons and grandsons deprived of the <span class="italic">ius honorum.</span> An end was put to these proscriptions on June 1, 81. Thus the elder Roscius’s name was not in the lists before this date, he was not one of the old <span class="italic">proscripti</span>, since that date was past, but was <span class="italic">in proscriptorum
numerum relatus</span> in order that his goods might be sold. He was not <span class="italic">proscriptus</span> according to the law. Mommsen on the meaning of the word <span class="italic">proscriptio</span> remarks: “It is a general term for any kind of notice, and not confined as a technical term to the regular penal code of the Romans. Sulla made it a word that inspired terror, but it was not a legal word in that sense. In legal language (without any addition such as <span class="italic">hominum</span>) it simply meant the surrender and confiscation of a man’s estate (not outlawry) which could be sold for the benefit of the State (from <span class="italic">proscribere,</span> to advertise, give notice of sale).”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_141_aa').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL240_141_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL240_141_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup><span class="italic">Manceps</span> is one who purchases anything from the State, or agrees to pay a certain sum by way of rent.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_141_b').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL240_141_c"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL240_141_c" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">c</sup>Alluding to Sulla having taken the name of Felix after he had put the younger Marius to death.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL240_141_c').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
