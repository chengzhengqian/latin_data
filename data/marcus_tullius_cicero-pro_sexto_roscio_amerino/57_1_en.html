Chrysogonus alone—that is a matter of indifference to me—but several others may consider themselves insulted. Nevertheless, the case is of such a nature that it does not seem that I need say much against “brokers”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_235_a" id="target_note_LCL240_235_a"><sup>a</sup></a> generally; for this case is assuredly of a novel and remarkable character.</p>
<p>Chrysogonus bought the property of Sextus<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">125</span><span class="br"></span> Roscius. Let us first consider this question: on what justifiable grounds was it sold, or how could it have been sold? And I will not put this question, gentlemen, in such a way as to imply that the sale of the property of an innocent citizen is scandalous. For, if such matters should find a hearing and be freely discussed,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_235_b" id="target_note_LCL240_235_b"><sup>b</sup></a> it will appear that Sextus Roscius was not a man of such importance in the State that we should make a complaint about his case more than about that of anyone else. My question is this: how, by virtue of that very law dealing with proscription, the Valerian or Cornelian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_235_c" id="target_note_LCL240_235_c"><sup>c</sup></a>—for I know nothing about it and do not know which it is—how, by virtue of that very law, could the property of Sextus Roscius have been sold? For it is said that it runs as follows:<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">126</span><span class="br"></span> “that the property, either of those who have been proscribed”—of whom Sextus Roscius is not one—“or
of those who have been slain within the enemy’s lines<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_235_da" id="target_note_LCL240_235_da"><sup>d</sup></a> should be sold.” As long as there were any lines, he was within those of Sulla. After we had finished fighting, during a time of perfect peace, he was slain at Rome, when returning from supper. If he was slain by virtue of the law, I admit that his property also was sold by virtue of the law; but if it is established that he was slain contrary to all laws,
