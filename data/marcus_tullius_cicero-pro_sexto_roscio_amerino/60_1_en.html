causing destruction, but to the mere force and the mighty agency of nature. But, on the other hand, the advantages of which we avail ourselves, the light which we enjoy, the air we breathe, these are favours given to us and bestowed upon us by Jupiter. Why then, gentlemen, should we be surprised, if Sulla, at the time when he alone guided the republic and swayed the world, when he was strengthening by laws the majesty of his supreme power which he had regained by force of arms, should unavoidably have allowed a few things to pass unnoticed? unless we ought rather to be surprised that human intelligence has not obtained results of which divine power is incapable.</p>

There is a considerable lacuna here, the purpose and some disconnected words being given by the Scholiast. The points dealt with in it by Cicero were no doubt the low price at which the property was sold (§ 130), and its disposal by Chrysogonus in various ways. His answer to this, according to the Scholiast, was: “Non quia timui, ne mihi tollerentur bona Roscii, ideo eius praedia dissipavi, sed quia aedificabam in Veientana, ideo de his transtuli,” “I did not disperse the property because I was afraid that it might be taken away from me, but removed part to a house I was building in Veientine territory.” Cicero, however, concluded from this dispersal that it had not been sold at all.
