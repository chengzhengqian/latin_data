men, who then for nights and days were running about armed, who never left Rome, who were always engaged in plundering and murdering—shall they reproach Sextus Roscius with the cruelty and misdeeds of those times, and imagine that the crowd of assassins, of which they themselves were the chiefs and leaders, will be a ground for accusing my client, who was not only not at Rome, but was entirely ignorant of what was going on there, because, as you yourself admit, he always remained in the country?</p>
<p>I am afraid, gentlemen, of either wearying you or<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">82</span><span class="br"></span>
appearing to distrust your intelligence, should I any longer discuss matters which are so obvious. Erucius’s accusation, I venture to think, has been entirely overthrown, unless perhaps you are waiting to hear me answer the charge of embezzlement<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_195_b" id="target_note_LCL240_195_b"><sup>b</sup></a> and other false accusations of the same kind which he has brought, charges which we never heard of before to-day, and which are quite new to us. He seemed to me to be rehearsing them<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_195_c" id="target_note_LCL240_195_c"><sup>c</sup></a> from some other speech, which he was preparing against another accused person, so little did they apply to the charge of parricide or to him who is on his trial. But since they are supported merely by his own word, a simple negative is a sufficient answer. If he is keeping back anything for the witnesses, in regard to that also, as in the cause itself, he will find us better prepared than he expected.</p>
