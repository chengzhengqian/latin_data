house on the Palatine: he has for his enjoyment a pleasant suburban country-seat, besides a number of farms all of them excellent and near the city; a house crammed with Delian and Corinthian vessels,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_243_a" id="target_note_LCL240_243_a"><sup>a</sup></a> among them that self-cooker,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_243_b" id="target_note_LCL240_243_b"><sup>b</sup></a> which he recently bought at so high a price that passers-by, hearing the auctioneer crying out the bids,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_243_c" id="target_note_LCL240_243_c"><sup>c</sup></a> thought that an estate was being sold. What quantities besides of embossed silver, of coverlets, pictures, statues, marble can you imagine he possesses? As much, of course, as could be heaped up in a single house, taken from many illustrious families during times of disturbance and rapine. But what am I to say about his vast household of slaves and the variety of their technical skill? I say nothing about such common<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">134</span><span class="br"></span> trades, such as those of cooks, bakers, litter-bearers: to charm his mind and ears, he has so many artists, that the whole neighbourhood rings daily with the sound of vocal music, stringed instruments, and flutes, and with the noise of banquets by night. When a man leads such a life, gentlemen, can you imagine his daily expenses, his lavish displays, his banquets? Quite respectable, I suppose, in such a house, if that can be called a house rather than a manufactory of wickedness and a lodging-house of every sort of crime. And look at the man himself, gentlemen;<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">135</span><span class="br"></span> you see how, with hair carefully arranged and reeking with perfume, he struts about all over the forum accompanied by a crowd of wearers of the toga<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_243_d" id="target_note_LCL240_243_d"><sup>d</sup></a>; you see what contempt he has for everyone, how he considers no one a human being compared with himself, and believes that he alone is wealthy and powerful.
