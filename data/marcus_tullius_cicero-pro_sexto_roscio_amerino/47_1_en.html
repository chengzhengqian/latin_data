distinction should not give evidence in a case that concerned themselves. Africanus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_215_a" id="target_note_LCL240_215_a"><sup>a</sup></a> who declares by<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">103</span><span class="br"></span>
his surname that he conquered a third part of the world, would nevertheless have refused to give evidence in a case in which his interests were at stake: for I do not venture to say in regard to such a man that, had he spoken, he would not have been believed. Consider now how everything has changed and altered for the worse. When it is a question of property and murder, a man is going to give evidence, one who is both a broker and an assassin, that is, he who is the purchaser and possessor of the very properties which are in question, and contrived the murder of the man whose death is the subject of investigation. What is it, most honourable sir? have you anything<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">104</span><span class="br"></span>
to say? Listen to me. Take care that you do not desert yourself; your personal interest also is seriously at stake. You have committed many crimes, many audacious and shameless acts; but you have also been guilty of one very great folly, undoubtedly of your own accord, not on the advice of Erucius. There was no need for you to sit there; for no one employs an accuser who is dumb, nor a witness who gets up from the accuserâ€™s bench.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_215_b" id="target_note_LCL240_215_b"><sup>b</sup></a> In addition to this, your partisanship would be to some extent more secret and concealed. But as it is, what is there that anyone would desire to hear from you, since everything you do is such that you seem intentionally to be acting on our behalf against yourselves?</p>
<p>Come, gentlemen, let us now see what took place<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">105</span><span class="br"></span>
immediately after the murder. Four days after Roscius had been killed, the news was taken to Chrysogonus in the camp of Lucius Sulla at Volaterrae.</p>
