innocent man, if he is accused, can be acquitted, and one who is guilty, unless he is accused, cannot be condemned; but it is more serviceable that an innocent man should be acquitted than that a guilty man should not be brought to trial. The food for the geese of the Capitol<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_171_a" id="target_note_LCL240_171_a"><sup>a</sup></a> is contracted for at the public expense, and dogs are kept there, to give the alarm in case thieves should break in. Certainly they cannot distinguish thieves from others, yet they give the alarm if any persons enter the Capitol by night, because this looks suspicious, and although they are merely animals, if they make a mistake, it is rather on the side of caution. But if the dogs should bark by daylight as well, when people come to worship the gods, I imagine they would have their legs broken, for being on the alert even at a time when there is no room for suspicion. It is just the same in the case of the accusers. Some<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">57</span><span class="br"></span>
of you are geese, who only cackle but cannot do any harm, others are dogs, who can both bark and bite. We take care that food is provided for you,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_171_b" id="target_note_LCL240_171_b"><sup>b</sup></a> but you ought especially to attack those who deserve it; this is most agreeable to the people. Next, when there is a probability that someone has committed a crime, if you have any suspicions, you may bark, if you like; that also is permissible. But if you act in such a manner as to endeavour to prove that a son has murdered his father, without being able to say why or how, if you only bark when there is no cause for suspicion, certainly your legs will not be broken, but, if I know these gentlemen well, they will brand your forehead with that letter,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL240_171_c" id="target_note_LCL240_171_c"><sup>c</sup></a> which is so odious to you accusers that you even hate all the Kalends, so deeply
