<p>II. There is a certain letter<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_463_2" id="target_note_LCL139_463_2"><sup>2</sup></a> which Commodus sent Albinus once, on naming his successor in office, in which he bade him assume the name of Caesar;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_463_3" id="target_note_LCL139_463_3"><sup>3</sup></a> of this letter I append a copy:</p>
<p>“The Emperor Commodus to Clodius Albinus greeting. I wrote you once officially about the succession to the throne and your own elevation to honour, but I am now sending you this private and confidential message, all written with my own hand, as you will see, in which I empower you, should emergency arise, to present yourself to the soldiers and assume the name of Caesar. For I hear that both Septimius Severus and Nonius Murcus are speaking ill of me to their troops, hoping thereby to get the appointment to the post of Augustus. You shall have full power besides, when you thus present yourself, to give the soldiers a largess of three aurei apiece. You will get a letter which I am sending to my procurators to this effect, sealed with my signet of an Amazon,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_463_4" id="target_note_LCL139_463_4"><sup>4</sup></a> which you will deliver to my stewards when the need arises, that they may not refuse your demands on the treasury. And that you may receive some definite symbol of an emperor’s majesty, I authorize you to wear both at the present time and at my court the scarlet cloak.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_463_5" id="target_note_LCL139_463_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
