<p>VI. As soon as he came of age he entered military service, and by the aid of Lollius Serenus, Baebius Maecianus and Ceionius Postumianus, all his kinsmen, he gained the notice of the Antonines. In the capacity of a tribune he commanded a troop of Dalmatian horse; he also commanded soldiers of the First and the Fourth legions.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_473_1" id="target_note_LCL139_473_1"><sup>1</sup></a> At the time of Avidius’ revolt he loyally held the Bithynian army <span class="marginNote right">157</span>to its allegiance. Next, Commodus transferred him to Gaul;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_473_2" id="target_note_LCL139_473_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and here he routed the tribes from over the Rhine and made his name illustrious among both Romans and barbarians.

The duty of holding the quaestorship was in his case remitted. This requirement waived, he became aedile, but after a term of only ten days he was despatched in haste to the army.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_473_6" id="target_note_LCL139_473_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Next, he served his praetorship under Commodus, and a very famous one it was. For at his games Commodus, it is said, gave gladiatorial combats in both the Forum and the <span class="marginNote right">194</span>theatre.

<p>VII. When he at last attained to the empire he was well advanced in years, for he was older, as Severus himself relates in his autobiography,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_473_7" id="target_note_LCL139_473_7"><sup>7</sup></a> than Pescennius Niger. But Severus, after his victory
