This fellow, false and ready for lies of every kind, who has even fabricated a noble lineage, you have now preferred to me. Why, even in the senate we must hear Statilius Corfulenus proposing to vote honours to Albinus and his brother, and all that was lacking was that the noble fellow should also vote him a triumph over me. It is even a greater source of chagrin, that some of you thought he should be praised for his knowledge of letters, when in fact he is busied with old wives’ songs, and grows senile amid the Milesian stories from Carthage that his friend Apuleius wrote and such other learned nonsense.” From all this it is clear how severely he attacked the followers of Pescennius and Albinus. Indeed, all these things are set down in his autobiography,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_487_2" id="target_note_LCL139_487_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and those who desire to know them in detail should read Marius Maximus among the Latin writers, and Herodian among the Greek, for they have related many things and with an eye to truth.</p>

He was easily roused, his anger was terrible, his rage relentless. In his pleasures he was changeable, for he sometimes craved wine and sometimes abstained. He had a thorough knowledge of arms<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_487_4" id="target_note_LCL139_487_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and was not ineptly called the Catiline of his age.</p>
