when hungry he devoured five hundred dried figs (called by the Greeks <span class="italic">callistruthiae)</span>, one hundred Campanian peaches, ten Ostian melons, twenty pounds’ weight of Labican grapes, one hundred figpeckers, and four hundred oysters. In his use of wine, however, Cordus says he was sparing, but Severus denies this,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_483_1" id="target_note_LCL139_483_1"><sup>1</sup></a> claiming that even in time of war he was drunken.
