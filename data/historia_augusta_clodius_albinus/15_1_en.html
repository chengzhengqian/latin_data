<p>We do not believe it wholly irrelevant to recount the causes which won Clodius Albinus the love of the senate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_489_1" id="target_note_LCL139_489_1"><sup>1</sup></a> After Commodus had bestowed upon him the name of Caesar, and while by the Emperor’s orders he was in command of the troops in Britain, false tidings were brought that Commodus had been slain. Then he came forth before the soldiers and delivered the following speech: “If the senate of the Roman people but had its ancient power, and if this vast empire were not under the sway of a single man, it would never have come to pass that the destiny of the state should fall into the hands of a Vitellius, a Nero, or a Domitian. Under the rule of consuls there were those mighty families of ours, the Ceionii, the Albini, and the Postumii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_489_2" id="target_note_LCL139_489_2"><sup>2</sup></a> of whom your fathers heard from their grandsires and from whom they learned many things. It was surely the senate, moreover, that added Africa to the dominions of Rome, the senate that conquered Gaul and the Spains, the senate that gave laws to the tribes of the East, and the senate that dared to attack the Parthians—and would have conquered them, too, had not the fortune of Rome just then assigned our army so covetous a leader.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_489_3" id="target_note_LCL139_489_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Britain, to be sure, was conquered by Caesar, but he was still a senator and not yet dictator. Now as for Commodus himself, how much better an emperor would he have been had he stood in awe of the senate! Even as late as the time of Nero, the power of the senate prevailed, and the senators did not fear to deliver speeches against a base and filthy prince and condemn him,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL139_489_4" id="target_note_LCL139_489_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
