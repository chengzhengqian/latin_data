The Pike enclosed in a net, though savage and huge, sinks down submissive, parting the sands with his tail <span class="italic">and when he feels the meshes pass over him</span> darts up into the air and by his leap mocks with impunity their guile. The bold Lamprey, too, aware of his smooth back, struggling with the looser meshes of the net, at length escapes by many slippery writhings, and damages by his example:<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL232_313_1" id="target_note_LCL232_313_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for by himself he finds a way for all.
