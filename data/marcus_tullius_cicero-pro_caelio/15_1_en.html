with him and to have been his accomplice, Publius Asicius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_435_a" id="target_note_LCL447_435_a"><sup>a</sup></a> has been tried and acquitted. Should, then, an accusation, which is of such a kind that the man who committed the crime does not deny it, while the man who denied it has been acquitted, be dreaded by Caelius who was free from any suspicion not only of guilt, but also of complicity? And, if Asicius derived more benefit from his trial than disadvantage from the odium attaching to it, what harm will your slander do to Caelius, who, in this affair, has not only not been suspected, but not even tainted with aspersion?

And this is not only the opinion of Caelius, but also that of two young men of the highest possible sensibility and scholarship, with the advantages of the finest kind of literary training and the most virtuous principles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_435_c" id="target_note_LCL447_435_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Titus and Gaius Coponius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_435_da" id="target_note_LCL447_435_da"><sup>d</sup></a> who more than anyone else were deeply affected by the death of Dio, and were attached to him as much by his devotion to learning and to the principles of human conduct as by ties of hospitality. Dio, as you have heard, lodged with Titus, who had made his acquaintance at Alexandria. What he or his most distinguished brother thinks of Marcus Caelius, you will hear from themselves if they appear as witnesses.
