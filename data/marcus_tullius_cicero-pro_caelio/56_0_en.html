Amid the rioting which followed the burning of the <span class="italic">curia</span> after Clodius’ murder he convened a <span class="italic">contio</span> for an address by Milo, but the audience was dispersed by the Clodian faction. Later, he strenuously opposed the bills <span class="italic">de vi</span> and <span class="italic">de ambitu</span> which Pompey brought forward as sole consul, on the ground that they were almost <span class="italic">privilegia</span> to the disadvantage of Milo, and he was deterred only by Pompey’s threat to pass his bills by force of arms.
