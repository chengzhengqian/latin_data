<p>XXIII. So then there remains the charge of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">56</span><span class="br"></span> poisoning, of which I can neither discover the origin nor unravel the end. For what motive could Caelius have had for wanting to poison this woman? That he might not have to return the gold? But did she ask for its return? To prevent a charge from lying against him?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_477_a" id="target_note_LCL447_477_a"><sup>a</sup></a> But did anyone accuse him of it? Would, in fact, anyone have mentioned it if Caelius had accused no one?

To the slaves of this woman? For this has been alleged against him. And was this man, whom you certainly credit with some ability, although your hostile language deprives him of other qualities—was he so great a fool as to entrust all his fortunes to another person’s slaves? But, I ask, what kind of slaves? This very point is most important.
