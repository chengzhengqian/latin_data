<p>In sections 25–30 Cicero turns from Atratinus to L. Herennius Balbus, one of the prosecutor’s two <span class="italic">subscriptores</span> (junior counsel). Herennius’ speech, the substance of which may be roughly deduced from Cicero’s remarks, had made a great impression not only on the jury but also on Cicero. But the moral lecture which Herennius read to Caelius and certain allegations of little consequence were much less disturbing to Cicero than his quiet sermon against youthful excesses. The jurors, Cicero pleaded, must not allow Caelius to be made a scapegoat for the sins of others. In this connexion Herennius could hardly have avoided a reference to the relations between Caelius and Clodia.</p>
<p>The special purpose of the remainder of the <span class="italic">praemunitio</span> (§§ 30–50) was to clear Caelius’ name of any discredit arising from Herennius’ disclosures about Caelius’ affair with Clodia. In paragraph 30 Cicero pretends to begin dealing with the two remaining charges, one about some gold, one about some poison. But they are introduced only to be dropped, for they served as a preliminary to Cicero’s real attack on Clodia, whose name is now first mentioned. “Clodia, the source of both charges, is the real foe, but, so far as I can, I will spare her.”</p>
<p>Cicero’s case was won by his superb tactics and oratory in sections 33–38, a passage highly admired in ancient times. It contains two examples of the rhetorical figure προσωποποιία, “a speech in character,” in which an orator impersonates individuals either long dead or still living. In sections 33–34 Cicero conjures up Appius Claudius Caecus, the Censor, Clodia’s most famous ancestor, who, Cicero says, will be able to deal with her as she deserves.</p>
