<p>XI. Now I noticed, gentlemen, that you listened to my friend, Lucius Herennius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_437_aa" id="target_note_LCL447_437_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> with very great attention. Although, in this connexion, you were markedly influenced by his ability and a particular style in his oratory, still I at times was afraid that his speech, carefully presented<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_437_b" id="target_note_LCL447_437_b"><sup>b</sup></a> to suggest guilt, might imperceptibly and gently steal into your minds. He spoke at length on profligacy, on lust, on the vices of youth, on morals. And, although he was usually a gentle soul and most pleasing in his display of those courteous manners which are now so widely admired, yet in court here he was the grimmest kind of uncle, moralist, mentor. He rebuked Marcus Caelius
as a son has never been rebuked by his father: he discoursed at length on wildness and excess. In short, gentlemen, I began to excuse your careful attention, because I myself was listening with horror to his most glum and bitter manner of speech. Well, the first<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">26</span><span class="br"></span> part of it, which affected me but little, was his allegation that Caelius was intimate with my friend Bestia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_437_c" id="target_note_LCL447_437_c"><sup>c</sup></a> dined with him, frequently visited him, helped him in his candidature for the praetorship. These allegations do not trouble me; they are quite evidently false. For he said that certain persons dined with Caelius, and these are either persons who are not here, or who are obliged to tell the same tale.
