<span class="italic">veneni,</span> § 30). Then comes in sections 59–60 a skilful but malicious digression on the untimely death of Clodia’s husband, Q. Metellus Celer (consul 60 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), whom she was suspected of having poisoned. In a quick transition from gravity to clever frivolity Cicero, in sections 61–69, dwells on the details of Caelius’ alleged attempt to poison Clodia. According to the prosecution, poison was given to a certain P. Licinius to be handed over to Clodia’s slaves. But Clodia’s slaves informed their mistress, who herself arranged a meeting that took place at the Senian Baths, so that Licinius could be caught actually handing over the poison. But Licinius was allowed to escape! No wonder Clodia manumitted her slaves! Since the detail is so circumstantial, this episode cannot have been entirely fictitious. Something must have happened at the Senian Baths which became the talk of Rome. The <span class="italic">obscenissima fabula</span> (§ 69) may well be the key to the mystery. Cicero’s treatment of this episode is an outstanding example of his oratorical versatility and subtlety. The jury would be too entertained to give critical attention to an amusing but bewildering story.</p>
<p>Cicero’s <span class="italic">peroratio</span> follows in sections 70–80. To have indicted Caelius under the <span class="italic">lex de vi</span> is monstrous treatment of a youth of such a creditable past and of such high promise. “Acquit him, and while earning the gratitude of his unhappy old father, you will also be serving the State.” The detailed statement given in sections 72–77 of Caelius’ public career, supplementing that of his earliest years (§§ 9–12), shows that Cicero felt it to be essential to present Caelius to the jury in a most favourable light.</p>
