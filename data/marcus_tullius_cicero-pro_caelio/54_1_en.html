this charge, do you think that there is any disgrace in a young man’s gallantries with a lady such as I have described? If you are modest, you will deny that Caelius has had any shameful dealings with you; if you are a wanton, there is clearly no case against Caelius”</p>
<p>Having thus dealt with various attempts to blacken Caelius’ character and to prejudice his case, Cicero passes in sections 51–69 to his <span class="italic">argumentatio.</span> In the first part (§§ 51–55) Cicero gives in enigmatic language a <span class="italic">narratio</span> of the charge about some gold (<span class="italic">crimen auri,</span> § 30). Clodia, apparently, lent Caelius some gold ornaments to help him, as he said, to pay for some games which he was producing; she gave them with no witnesses, and did not ask for them back. Caelius’ real purpose, however, in getting the ornaments was alleged to be their use as a bribe to induce the slaves of L. Lucceius to murder Dio of Alexandria, their master’s guest. Cicero pleads that either Clodia gave Caelius the ornaments with full knowledge of his purpose, or, if he dared not tell her, she cannot have given them to him; and that his best course would be to call as a witness Lucceius himself, with whom Dio was lodging at the time of the alleged attack. If, as is not impossible, there is some truth behind this mystery, it must lie in an attempt by Caelius to ingratiate himself with Pompey who was suspected of authorizing or conniving at the murder of Dio. Lucceius’ evidence, in documentary form, was deposed on oath and read out in court (§55).</p>
<p>Sections 56–58, in which the second part of the <span class="italic">argumentatio</span> begins, contain Cicero’s general reflections on the inconsistency and improbability of the allegation that Caelius wanted to poison Clodia (<span class="italic">crimen</span>
