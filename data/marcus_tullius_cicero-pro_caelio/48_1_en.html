maligned)—from this, whatever it was, he emerged and completely broke loose and escaped, and he is so far from the disgrace of being intimate with that woman, that he now has to defend himself against her enmity and hatred. And to silence all<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">76</span><span class="br"></span> the gossip about loose living and idleness that intervened—he did this absolutely against my wishes and in spite of my opposition, but still he did it—he brought an action for bribery against a friend of mine.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_501_a" id="target_note_LCL447_501_a"><sup>a</sup></a> Although he was acquitted, Caelius returned to the charge and indicted him again; he refused to listen to any of us, and showed himself more violent than I could wish. But I am not speaking about good sense, a quality which does not belong to his years; I am speaking about his impetuosity, his eagerness to win, his ardent desire for glory. Such passions, in men who have reached our time of life, ought to be somewhat restrained, but in youth, as with plants, they give promise of what virtue in its ripeness and how great the fruits of industry will some day be.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_501_b" id="target_note_LCL447_501_b"><sup>b</sup></a> Why, young men of great talent always need to be checked rather than encouraged in the quest of distinction; youth is an age when, if it is beginning to display exuberance in its intellectual gifts, pruning rather than grafting is needed.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_501_c" id="target_note_LCL447_501_c"><sup>c</sup></a> Wherefore, if anyone thinks that Caelius’ energy,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">77</span><span class="br"></span> spirit, obstinacy, either in beginning or in carrying on his enmities, have been too ardent, or if any of even these trifles give some offence, his shade of purple,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_501_d" id="target_note_LCL447_501_d"><sup>d</sup></a> his hosts of friends, his sparkle, his brilliance—all this feverishness, you will find, will soon have cooled down; age, experience and time will have mellowed all.</p>
