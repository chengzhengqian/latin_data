<p>1. No discredit attaches to Caelius’ father, who is an example to all members of the <span class="italic">ordo equester</span> and deserves the respect which his son has always paid him.</p>
<p>2. Caelius’ alleged unpopularity with his fellow-townsmen
is disproved by their sending a deputation to honour him.</p>
<p>3. Cicero regrets that Atratinus has been commissioned to attack Caelius’ morals when he was a young man, for he can vouch for their excellence, since his father committed him to his care.</p>
<p>4. Caelius’ connexion with Catiline has been cast in his teeth. This was pardonable, for his years of dependence were then over, and even Cicero himself once almost fell a victim to Catiline’s sinister but remarkable spell.</p>
<p>5. Charges of complicity in the Catilinarian plot, and of bribery and corrupt practice, can be dismissed.</p>
<p>6. There is nothing to support the accusation that Caelius is in debt. It was with his father’s full approval that he left home, and the prosecutor has quoted far too high a figure for the rent of Caelius’ house on the Palatine where, unfortunately, he met his Medea (Clodia).</p>
<p>7. Cicero has no fear of the allegations which will be made by some mysterious witnesses, that Caelius laid violent hands on a senator at the pontifical elections and criminally assaulted certain married women after a dinner-party.</p>
<p>8. Cicero could wish that Crassus as one of Caelius’ counsel, in his able treatment of the matters entrusted to him, had also replied to the point about Dio of Alexandria. But he asserts, and can prove, that the murder of Dio is a topic wholly irrelevant to the case.</p>
