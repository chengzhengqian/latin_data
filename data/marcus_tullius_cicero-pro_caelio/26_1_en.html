code of morality? Is this the way you train young men? Was this the reason why his father recommended and entrusted this lad to you, that he might spend his youth in love and pleasures, and that you yourself should defend such a life and such pursuits?” For myself, gentlemen, if there ever was a man of mind strong enough, of character sufficiently virtuous and self-controlled, to despise all pleasures and spend the whole course of his life in bodily labour and mental exertion; to be insensible to the attractions of rest, of relaxation, of the pursuits of his friends, of love-affairs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_457_a" id="target_note_LCL447_457_a"><sup>a</sup></a> and festivities; to think that nothing in life was worth striving for unless it was united with glory and honour—such a man, in my judgment, I hold to have been endowed and blessed with virtues greater than human. Such I think were those famous Camilli, Fabricii, Curii,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_457_ba" id="target_note_LCL447_457_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> and all those who made Rome so great that was once so small. But virtues of this kind<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">40</span><span class="br"></span> are no longer to be found in our manners, indeed but rarely in our books. The papers<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_457_c" id="target_note_LCL447_457_c"><sup>c</sup></a> also that recorded this old-world austerity have gone out of fashion; and not only among us who have followed this path and rule of life in practice rather than in theory, but also among the Greeks, men of profound learning, who in their speech and in their writing, but not in their actions, could reach honour and brilliance, have precepts of another kind come into fashion now
