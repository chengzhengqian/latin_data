war between armed dynasts, Caelius, after some temporary inclination towards Pompey, came to realize that it was Caesar who would dominate Roman politics. From his tribunate onwards, therefore, Caelius supported Caesar more and more actively. But no one can read the sorry story of the closing months of his life without realizing how his defects of character contributed to his tragic end. Out of sympathy with Caesar’s far-sighted policy, he fell a victim to extreme impetuosity; he “lost his head.” There is justice in each of two ancient judgments on Caelius. Velleius Paterculus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_522_a" id="target_note_LCL447_522_a"><sup>a</sup></a> comparing him with Curio, calls him “quite as clever in his worthlessness” (<span class="italic">nec minus ingeniose nequam</span>); Quintilian<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_522_b" id="target_note_LCL447_522_b"><sup>b</sup></a>
sums him up acutely and sympathetically as “a man who deserved both a wiser mind and a longer life” (<span class="italic">dignus vir cui et mens melior et vita longior contigisset</span>).</p>
