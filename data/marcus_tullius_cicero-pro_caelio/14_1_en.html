this number, how many do you think there are ready to offer their services voluntarily, to exert themselves, to promise their evidence to men of power, influence and volubility, when they think they want to obtain something? If, among people of this class,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">22</span><span class="br"></span> there may be some who have by chance pushed themselves into this trial, do you, gentlemen, shut out their greed by your wisdom, that you may show yourselves to have had a careful regard at one and the same time for the welfare of my client, for your conscience, and for the security of all citizens against dangerous and powerful individuals. For my part I shall not trouble you with witnesses, nor in this case will I allow the real facts, which cannot in any way be changed, to depend on what witnesses choose to say, statements which can be so readily manipulated, so easily bent and distorted from the truth. We will proceed by arguments; we will refute the charges against us by proofs that are clearer than daylight; we will meet facts with facts, cause with cause, reason with reason.</p>

But there is some evidence which suggests that she was the mother or stepmother of L. Gellius Poplicola, husband of Sempronia Atratina, adoptive sister of Caelius’ prosecutor Atratinus. This Gellius Poplicola was half-brother of L. Marcius Philippus (consul 56 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) and as a witness against P. Sestius in Feb.-Mar. 56 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> was fiercely attacked by Cicero (see <span class="italic">Pro Sestio</span>, 110–112). Ellis’ identification of him (<span class="italic">Commentary

as a family affair.
