<p>XIX. But in Marcus Caelius—for I now intend to<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">44</span><span class="br"></span> speak more boldly of his honourable pursuits, since in reliance on your wisdom I venture freely to make certain confessions—you will find no profligacy, no extravagance, no debts, no passion for gluttony and evil haunts—that vice of greed and guzzling, which men find that age not only does not lessen but even increases. But love-making, and these “affairs” as they are called, which as a rule do not long trouble those of stronger minds—for they lose their bloom early and quickly—have never held my client entangled in their grasp.

But there was also, unless possibly I was misled by affection, a method based on liberal studies and brought to perfection by painstaking and tireless application. And yet be assured, gentlemen, that those excesses with which Caelius is reproached, and these pursuits which I am discussing, cannot easily be found in the same man. For it is impossible that a mind given up to the allurements of passion, hampered by love, longing, desire, often by excessive wealth, sometimes also by the lack of it, can sustain the efforts, whatever they may be, which we make
