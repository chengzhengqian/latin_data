been manumitted with the approval<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_493_a" id="target_note_LCL447_493_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of her kinsmen, most noble and illustrious persons. At last, then, we have found something which that lady may be said to have done with the approval and with the sanction of those gallant gentlemen, her relatives. But I desire to know what is the drift of that manumission; for it either means that a charge had been concocted against Caelius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_493_b" id="target_note_LCL447_493_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or that a possibility of examination<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_493_c" id="target_note_LCL447_493_c"><sup>c</sup></a> had been eliminated or that a justification was found for rewarding slaves who shared so many of her secrets. “But,” I am told, “her kinsmen approved.” Why should they not, since you said that you reported to them facts not brought to you by others, but discovered by you yourself? And at this point do we<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">69</span><span class="br"></span> really wonder if this imaginary box has given rise to a most improper story?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_493_d" id="target_note_LCL447_493_d"><sup>d</sup></a> There is nothing which does not seem to fit into the acts of such a lady. The story has been heard of, and is in all men’s mouths. You have long since understood, gentlemen, what I wish, or rather, what I do not wish to say. However, even if the story is true, it is not true of Caelius (for what had it to do with him?); it was perhaps a trick played by some young man with less modesty than wit. But if it is an invention, although not decent, yet it is a lie not without humour. In my opinion, it would not have been accepted in general talk and opinion, did not every story, which could not be told without a blush, seem perfectly to square nicely with that lady’s reputation.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_493_e" id="target_note_LCL447_493_e"><sup>e</sup></a></p>
