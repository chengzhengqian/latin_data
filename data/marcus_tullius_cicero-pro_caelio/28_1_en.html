pleasure sometimes triumph over reason, provided that in such matters the following rule and limitation is observed: let a young man be mindful of his own repute and not a despoiler of another’s; let him not squander his patrimony; nor be crippled by usury; nor attack the home and reputation of another; nor bring shame upon the chaste, taint upon the virtuous, disgrace upon the upright; let him frighten none by violence, quit conspiracy, keep clear of crime. Lastly, when he has listened to the voice of pleasure and given some time to love-affairs and these empty desires of youth, let him at length turn to the interests of home life, to activity at the bar and in public affairs, so that all those pursuits the vanity of which reason had previously failed to reveal, he may show that he has abandoned from satiety and found contemptible through experience.</p>
<p>And, gentlemen, both in our own days and within<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">43</span><span class="br"></span> the memory of our fathers and ancestors, there have been many great men and illustrious citizens who, after the passions of youth had simmered down, have in their maturer years been eminently conspicuous for their virtues.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_461_a" id="target_note_LCL447_461_a"><sup>a</sup></a> I do not care to mention any of them by name; do you recall them for yourselves.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_461_b" id="target_note_LCL447_461_b"><sup>b</sup></a> For I do not wish to associate the high renown of any brave and illustrious citizen with even the slightest fault. Were that my wish I could bring forward the names of many men of the highest rank and distinction who were notorious, some for gross licentiousness in youth, some for utter profligacy, vast debts, extravagances, sensual excesses, but whose failings were afterwards so covered over by numerous virtues, that anyone who wished could excuse them on the plea of youth.</p>
