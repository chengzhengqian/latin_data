<blockquote><p><span class="line">Why have you become acquainted with a strange woman?</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Scatter and squander;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">You may do as you please for all I care. ‘Tis you, not I,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">who’ll rue your poverty.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<p>To this glum and outspoken old man Caelius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">38</span><span class="br"></span> would reply that no mad passion caused him to stray from the right path. What proof of this would he give? No extravagance, no waste, no borrowing to pay his debts.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_455_a" id="target_note_LCL447_455_a"><sup>a</sup></a> “But it was reported that there was.” How few are there who can avoid such reports in so slanderous a city! Are you surprised that a neighbour of this woman gained a bad repute, when her own brother has been unable to escape slanderous tongues? But if I take a mild and indulgent father like this one, who would say:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">He has broken a door, the wreck shall be made good;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He has torn your clothes, they shall be mended up,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_455_b" id="target_note_LCL447_455_b"><sup>b</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Caelius’ case is quite without difficulty. For what charge could there be on which he would not find it easy to defend himself? I am not now saying anything against that woman,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_455_c" id="target_note_LCL447_455_c"><sup>c</sup></a> but suppose it were someone quite unlike her—a woman who made herself common to all, who openly had some special lover every day, into whose grounds, house and place at Baiae every rake had a right of free entry, who even supported young men, and made their fathers’ stinginess bearable at her own expense; if a widow were casting off restraints, a frisky widow living frivolously, a rich widow living extravagantly, an amorous widow living a loose life, should I regard any man guilty of misconduct if he had been somewhat free in his attentions to her?</p>
