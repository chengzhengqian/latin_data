by the wealth of a courtesan,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_409_a" id="target_note_LCL447_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a> what will he think? that the accuser’s sense of duty is excusable, that woman’s passions must be checked, and that you, gentlemen, are worked too hard, since even on a public holiday there is no holiday for you. In fact,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">2</span><span class="br"></span> if you wish to attend carefully, and to form a correct idea of this case as a whole, you will understand, gentlemen, that no one would ever have ventured to take up this case if he had been allowed any choice in the matter; nor, when he had thus demeaned himself, would he have expected a favourable result, unless he were supported by the intolerable passions and unnatural hatred of someone else.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_409_a" id="target_note_LCL447_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a> As for myself, I pardon Atratinus, who is a most accomplished and excellent young man and a friend of mine; he can plead as an excuse either filial affection, or necessity,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_409_a" id="target_note_LCL447_409_a"><sup>a</sup></a> or his age. If he was willing to bring the accusation, I put it down to affection; if he was under orders, to necessity; if he had any hopes, to his boyhood. The other accusers have no claim to indulgence; they deserve a most vigorous resistance.</p>

<p>II. I think, gentlemen, that the defence of a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">3</span><span class="br"></span> young man like Marcus Caelius can best be introduced if I begin by answering what his accusers have said to disgrace my client and to strip him and despoil him of his good name. His father has been made a matter of reproach to him in differing ways, either as himself not living in suitable style,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_409_b" id="target_note_LCL447_409_b"><sup>b</sup></a> or as having been treated with insufficient respect by his son.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_409_c" id="target_note_LCL447_409_c"><sup>c</sup></a> In regard to the position he holds, Marcus Caelius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_409_d" id="target_note_LCL447_409_d"><sup>d</sup></a>
