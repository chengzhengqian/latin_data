These witnesses, gentlemen, I now wait for, not only without alarm, but even with some hope of amusement. My mind is athrill at the idea<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">67</span><span class="br"></span> of seeing, in the first place, these young dandies, intimate friends of a rich and high-born lady, and, then again, those valiant warriors, posted by their commandress in ambush and in garrison at the Baths. I intend to ask them how or where they concealed themselves; whether it was a bath-tub, or a “Trojan Horse,” which received and protected so many invincible warriors, waging war for a woman. In truth, I will force them to answer this question, why so many strong men did not either seize him where he stood or overtake him in his flight, a man alone and so weak, as you see; in my opinion they will never disentangle themselves if they come forward into the witness-box. Although at dinner-parties they are humorous, witty, sometimes glib over their cups, the idea of a court is one thing, that of a dining-room is another; benches here and couches there have different meanings; to face judges and fellow-revellers is not the same thing; in short, the light of the sun is far different from the light of lamps. And so we will shake out<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_491_a" id="target_note_LCL447_491_a"><sup>a</sup></a> all their pretty ways, all their follies, if they come forward. But let them listen to me: let them busy themselves elsewhere, let them curry favour by other means, let them show themselves off in other ways, let them ingratiate themselves with their lady by their elegant manners, outdo the rest by their extravagance, be always by her side, lie at her feet, be her humble servants; but let them spare the life and fortunes of an innocent man.</p>
