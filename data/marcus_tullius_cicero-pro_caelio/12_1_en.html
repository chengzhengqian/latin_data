<p class="noindent">Thus, gentlemen, you will learn what I will show when I have reached that point in my speech,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_429_b" id="target_note_LCL447_429_b"><sup>b</sup></a> that this Medea of the Palatine<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_429_c" id="target_note_LCL447_429_c"><sup>c</sup></a> and his change of residence have been for a young man the cause of all his misfortunes, or rather of all the gossip.</p>

If he answers my questions with shrewdness and point, I will then ask, finally, what was the source and origin of that senator? For if he proves to be himself his own source and origin, possibly I may be impressed, as usual; but if he is just a rivulet
