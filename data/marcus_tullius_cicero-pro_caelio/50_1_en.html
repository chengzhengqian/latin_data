Lutatius Catulus (consul 102 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) built on the Palatine a monument called the Porticus Catuli to commemorate
the victory at Vercellae (101 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>); it was on the site of the confiscated house of M. Fulvius Flaccus, a partisan of C. Gracchus. Cicero’s own house on the Palatine adjoined the Porticus Catuli. During Cicero’s exile P. Clodius destroyed Cicero’s house and pulled down the Porticus Catuli. In Nov. 57 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> P. Clodius burnt q. Cicero’s house in the same region and attempted to destroy the Porticus Catuli which was being rebuilt.
