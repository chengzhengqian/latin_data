<p class="noindent">A neighbour, a young man, caught your eye; his beauty, his tall figure, his looks and eyes took you by storm; you wanted to see him often; you were sometimes-with him in the same park; you are a great lady, and by your wealth you want to keep hold of a young fellow who has a mean and niggardly father; you cannot do it; he kicks, treats you with contempt; he does not think your gifts are worth so much; well, try a choice elsewhere. You have grounds by the Tiber purposely procured just at the place where all the young men come to bathe; from there you may pick up marriage proposals<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_453_a" id="target_note_LCL447_453_a"><sup>a</sup></a> any day; why do you worry this man who disdains your advances?”</p>

<p>XVI. I come now to you in turn, Caelius, and myself <span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">37</span><span class="br"></span> assume the authority and severity of a father. But I doubt which father above all I am to choose—a rough and unfeeling one, like the one in Caecilius?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_453_b" id="target_note_LCL447_453_b"><sup>b</sup></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">For now at last my mind’s afire,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">My heart is full of wrath—</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">or this one:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">O miserable villain!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_453_c" id="target_note_LCL447_453_c"><sup>c</sup></a></span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Those fathers have hearts of iron:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="line">What am I to say? What am I to wish? Whate’er you do,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">By your disgraceful deeds you make my wishes vain.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="noindent">They are almost unendurable. Such a father would say: “Why have you betaken yourself to the neighbourhood of that courtesan? Why did you not flee as soon as you found out her allurements?</p>
