<p>In his early letters to Cicero Caelius importuned him for a consignment of Cilician panthers and for donations from the province for the games which he would celebrate as aedile in 50 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> But Cicero was obdurate to both requests.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_517_b" id="target_note_LCL447_517_b"><sup>b</sup></a> His aedileship was remarkable for an attack on an abuse connected with the public water supply.
