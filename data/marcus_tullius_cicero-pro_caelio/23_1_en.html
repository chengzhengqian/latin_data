But I will attend to this later, and in such a manner, gentlemen, that I feel confident I shall be able to justify the life of Marcus Caelius even to the severest judges. But as for you, woman (for now it is myself alone and not an imaginary person who addresses you), if you have an intention of proving your deeds, your words, your assertions, your intrigues, your allegations, you will have to render an account of and explain such intimacy, such familiarity, such a close connexion.
