<span class="label"><span class="ac">IV. <span class="sc">The Structure of the <span class="italic">Pro Caelio</span></span></span></span>
<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">In</span> his exordium (§§ 1–2), warmly praised by Quintilian, Cicero at once makes clear his plan of action. He sympathizes with the jury on their attendance in court on a day of public festival, and maintains that Caelius has committed no offence proper to the jurisdiction of the court before which he appears as a defendant arraigned under the <span class="italic">lex de vi.</span> Atratinus
is the nominal prosecutor, but the real attack has been launched from the background by an evil woman.</p>
<p>In sections 3–50 Cicero presents his <span class="italic">praemunitio,</span> the consolidation (“building-up”) of his case, an unusual procedure because the <span class="italic">exordium</span> would normally be followed by the <span class="italic">narratio</span> or statement of the facts. The purpose of this <span class="italic">praemunitio</span> is to dispose of several insinuations made by the prosecution. This unorthodox procedure was, no doubt, made advisable by the fact that three of the five formal charges had already been dealt with by Crassus, and by Cicero’s fear that a conventional <span class="italic">narratio</span> of matters connected with the two remaining charges might prejudice his client. In section 30 a <span class="italic">narratio</span> makes a brief appearance, only to disappear.</p>
<p>The prosecution’s insinuations, intended to blacken Caelius’ character, are thus refuted by Cicero in sections 3 to 24.</p>
