<p>In section 35 we have a transition to Cicero’s second “speech in character.” In this transition, after saying that later he will defend Caelius against any strictures from the austere Appius Claudius, Cicero turns to Clodia and demands that she shall explain her intimacy with Caelius. Cicero’s second “speech in character” is found in section 36, where he impersonates P. Clodius, Clodia’s profligate brother and his own enemy. Clodius’ cynical questionings of his sister about her liaison with Caelius condemn her no less effectively than the stern interrogation of Appius Claudius.</p>
<p>As he had promised in section 35, Cicero passes in sections 37–38 to his defence of Caelius. He sets off his impersonations of Appius Claudius and Clodius by the device of introducing from Roman comedy two fathers of opposite temperaments (σύγκρισις). To the tirades of a crotchety old man from Caecilius, Caelius can reply that he never misconducted himself; to an indulgent father from Terence he can easily defend his gallant attentions to a lady of free and easy manners. The complaints of a <span class="italic">meretrix</span> like Clodia, now first openly called such, cannot substantiate any charge of misconduct against Caelius.</p>
<p>Cicero then passes to moral reflections in what may be called a <span class="italic">locus de indulgentia.</span> In sections 39–42<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_511_aa" id="target_note_LCL447_511_aa"><sup>a</sup></a> he replies to any who may assert that his tutelage

In publications appearing between 1913 and 1944 foreign scholars investigated these sections and submitted varying explanations. In his edition of 1933 R. G. Austin summarized the opinions then available (Appendix viii, pp. 122–125) and offered a tentative solution: that Cicero, impressed by the speech of Herennius (§ 25), decided to abbreviate, modify and even omit some of the material which he had already prepared for delivery; that we possess not only Cicero’s original draft in its place, but also the actual arrangement which he followed in delivering his speech; and that the speech was published at once without careful revision. In his second edition (1952) Austin modifies his earlier solution in the light of the opinion of, among others, H. Drexler (“Zu Ciceros Rede pro Caelio,” <span class="italic">Nachrichten von der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Göttingen,</span> Phil.-Hist. Kl., 1944, pp. 1–32). He considers that the difficulty of Cicero’s case obliged him to repeat certain points vital for the defence; and that the first of each pair of “doublets” (in no sense awkward) serves a purpose different from the second. He rejects his earlier view that §§ 39–43 were never delivered, since he now regards the whole of the long passage in §§ 39–50 as vital for Cicero’s purpose. A reasonable conclusion is that the <span class="italic">Pro Caelio</span> was published at once in the form in which it was delivered.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL447_511_aa').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
