Therefore, gentlemen, reject the whole assumption<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_423_b" id="target_note_LCL447_423_b"><sup>b</sup></a> of the prosecution, and let not Caelius’ association with Catiline cleave to him as a ground for charge; for he shares that with many others, and even some of the loyal.

I had to see his crimes before I believed them, and to have my hands on them before I even suspected them.

For you have alleged—although indeed with hesitation and hints—that
Caelius’ friendship for Catiline had made him a partner in the Conspiracy; and as to that, so far from any charge holding good, the speech of our talented young friend hardly held together. Was Caelius such a mad revolutionary, was he so maimed either in character and nature, or in position and fortune?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_423_e" id="target_note_LCL447_423_e"><sup>e</sup></a> When, in fact, the suspicion was abroad, where was the name of Caelius heard? I am wasting words on a matter where there is not the slightest doubt; but none the less I say this: if Caelius had been privy to the Conspiracy, or even if he had not been bitterly
