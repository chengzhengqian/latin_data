protection, denying that he had handed over that box to them. And how were they to refute him? Were they to say that they saw him?

They therefore showed themselves just at the very moment after Licinius had arrived, when he was getting out the box, stretching forth his hand, handing over the poison.

<p>XXVIII. Why was it, I ask, that when Licinius<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">66</span><span class="br"></span> was faltering, retreating, striving to escape, those warriors under their feminine orders allowed him to give them the slip? Why did they not seize him, why did they not on his own confession, in the sight of so many witnesses, and by the cry of the deed, firmly model<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_489_e" id="target_note_LCL447_489_e"><sup>e</sup></a> a charge of an outrageous crime? Perhaps they were afraid that so many of them could not overpower a single man, they strong and he weak, they alert and he terrified?</p>
<p>There is no argument in the facts, no suspicion in the case, no conclusion in the charge that can possibly be discovered. So this case, without any argument, or inference, or those indications by which light is usually thrown upon truth, is left entirely to the witnesses.
