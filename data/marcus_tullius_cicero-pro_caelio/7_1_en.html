consulship, together with Catiline; Caelius never attached himself to him, never separated himself from me.</p>

<p>V. It was only after he had constantly for so many<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">11</span><span class="br"></span> years frequented the Forum without reproach or dishonour that he attached himself to Catiline, then<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_419_a" id="target_note_LCL447_419_a"><sup>a</sup></a> a second time a candidate for the consulship. How long then do you think that his youth should have been protected? When I was young, we usually spent a year “keeping our arms in our gown”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_419_ba" id="target_note_LCL447_419_ba"><sup>b</sup></a> and, in tunics, undergoing our physical training on the Campus, and, if we began our military service at once, the same practice was followed for our training in camp and in operations. At that age, unless anyone could defend himself by his own strength of character and clean living, by good home training and also by some inborn virtue, however carefully he might be guarded by his own friends he could not escape a scandal backed by truth.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL447_419_c" id="target_note_LCL447_419_c"><sup>c</sup></a> But anyone who had kept those first beginnings of youth pure and undefiled, by the time he had grown up and become a man among men, no one would speak evil of his reputation and morals. Yes, Caelius did support Catiline, after he<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span> had had several years’ training in public life; and many, of all ranks and ages, have done the same. For this Catiline, as I think you remember, showed in himself numerous features of excellence, if not firmly modelled, at least drawn in outline. He associated with many depraved persons. Yes, but he pretended that he was devoted to men of excellent character.
