Arabs, two hundred Saracens, and four hundred irregulars from Mesopotamia; you will have the Third Legion, the Fortunate,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_215_1" id="target_note_LCL263_215_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and eight hundred mounted cuirassiers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_215_2" id="target_note_LCL263_215_2"><sup>2</sup></a> You will also have with you Hariomundus, Haldagates, Hildomundus and Charioviscus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_215_3" id="target_note_LCL263_215_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
The prefects have arranged for the needful supplies in all the camps. Your duty it is, with the aid of your wisdom and skill, to place your winter and summer camps where you will lack nothing, and, furthermore, to ascertain where the enemy’s train is, and to find out exactly how great his forces are and of what kind, in order that no supplies may be used in vain or weapons wasted, for on these depends all success in war.

And indeed, he, in whose place I have made you deputy, is no less great a man. It is, therefore, proper that you should expect the consulship,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_215_4" id="target_note_LCL263_215_4"><sup>4</sup></a> with this same Ulpius Crinitus as colleague, for the following year, beginning on the eleventh day before the Kalends of June, to fill out the term of Gallienus and Valerian, and your expenses shall be paid from the public funds. For we should aid the poverty of those men—and of none more than those—who after a long life in public affairs are nevertheless poor.” This letter also shows how great a man Aurelian was—and
truly great, indeed, for no one ever reached the highest place who did not from his earliest years climb up by the ladder of noble character.</p>
