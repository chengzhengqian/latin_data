Greek, that revered man poured forth in the following words the sorrow that his groan implied: “And so Thersites<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_195_1" id="target_note_LCL263_195_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and Sinon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_195_2" id="target_note_LCL263_195_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and other such monsters of antiquity are well known to us and will be spoken of by our descendants; but shall the Deified Aurelian, that most famous of princes, that most firm of rulers, who restored the whole world to the sway of Rome, be unknown to posterity? God prevent such madness! And yet, if I am not mistaken, we possess the written journal of that great man and also his wars recorded in detail in the manner of a history, and these I should like you to procure and set forth in order, adding thereto all that pertains to his life. All these things you may learn in your zeal for research from the linen books,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_195_3" id="target_note_LCL263_195_3"><sup>3</sup></a> for he gave instructions that in these all that he did each day should be written down. I will arrange, moreover, that the Ulpian Library<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_195_4a" id="target_note_LCL263_195_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> shall provide you with the linen books themselves. It would be my wish that you write a work on Aurelian, representing him, to the best of your ability, just as he really was.” I have carried out these instructions, my dear Ulpianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_195_5" id="target_note_LCL263_195_5"><sup>5</sup></a> I have procured the Greek books and laid my hands on all that I needed, and from these sources I have gathered together into one little book all that was worthy of mention. You I should wish to think kindly of my work, and, if you are not content therewith, to study the Greeks and even to demand the linen books themselves, which the Ulpian Library will furnish you whenever you desire.</p>
