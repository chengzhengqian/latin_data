this perpetual by means of the following arrangement. In Etruria, all along the Aurelian Way<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_289_1" id="target_note_LCL263_289_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as far as the Maritime Alps, there are vast tracts of land, rich and well wooded. He planned, therefore, to pay their price to the owners of these uncultivated lands, provided they wished to sell, and to settle thereon families of slaves captured in war, and then to plant the hills with vines,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_289_2" id="target_note_LCL263_289_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and by this means to produce wine, which was to yield no profit to the privy-purse but to be given entirely to the people of Rome. He had also made provision for the vats, the casks, the ships, and the labour. Many, however, say that Aurelian was cut off before he carried this out, others that he was restrained by his prefect of the guard, who is said to have remarked: “If we give wine to the Roman people, it only remains for us to give them also chickens and geese.” There is, indeed, proof that Aurelian really considered this measure, or, rather, made arrangements for carrying it out and even did so to some extent; for wine belonging to the privy-purse is stored in the porticos of the Temple of the Sun,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_289_3" id="target_note_LCL263_289_3"><sup>3</sup></a> which the people could obtain, not free of cost but at a price. It should be known, however, that he thrice distributed largess<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_289_4a" id="target_note_LCL263_289_4a"><sup>4</sup></a> among them, and that he gave to the Roman people white tunics with long sleeves, brought from the various provinces, and pure linen ones from Africa and Egypt, and that he was the first to give handkerchiefs to the Roman people, to be waved in showing approval.</p>
