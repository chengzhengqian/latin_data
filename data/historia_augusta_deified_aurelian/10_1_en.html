Integrity, my dearest kinsman, will supply the aforesaid man, as long as he shall be in Rome, with sixteen loaves of soldiers’ bread of the finest quality, forty loaves of soldiers’ bread of the quality used in camp, forty pints of table-wine, the half of a swine, two fowl, thirty pounds of pork, forty pounds of beef, one pint of oil and likewise one pint of fish-pickle, one pint of salt, and greens and vegetables as much as shall be sufficient. And indeed, since something out of the ordinary must be allowed him, as long as he shall be in Rome, you will allow him fodder beyond the usual amount and for his own expenses, moreover, a daily grant of two aurei of Antoninus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_211_1a" id="target_note_LCL263_211_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> fifty silver minutuli of Philip, and one hundred denarii of bronze.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_211_2" id="target_note_LCL263_211_2"><sup>2</sup></a> All else will be furnished by the prefects of the treasury<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_211_3" id="target_note_LCL263_211_3"><sup>3</sup></a>.”</p>

That gold coins of any of the Antonines were current at the time when these “letters” were supposed to have been written is very doubtful. The name Antoninianus is usually applied (though with no other warrant than these “letters”) to the new silver coin that was issued by Caracalla and the later emperors of the third century, but there is no reason to suppose that it was ever given to the <span class="italic">aureus.</span> The term Philippeus was familiar, from long-standing tradition, as a designation for the aureus (see note to <span class="italic">Claud.</span>, xiv. 3), but neither the small silver minutuli (see note to <span class="italic">Alex.</span>, xxii. 8) nor the bronze coins had any possible connection with Philip of Macedonia, nor is there any reason to suppose that they took their name from Philippus Arabs, who did not institute any reform in the coinage. It would seem that the author, failing to understand the real significance of the term Philippeus and supposing that it was derived from the name of the emperor, has applied both it and Antoninianus to all coins indiscriminately, for the purpose of creating the impression of greater learning; see Menadier, p. 27 f.; p. 47 f.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_211_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_211_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_211_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>The expression <span class="italic">aeris denarios</span> is nonsense, since these coins were not made of bronze but of base metal washed with silver.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_211_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_211_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_211_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>The statement that supplies will be furnished to an army officer by the prefect of the <span class="italic">aerarium</span> (the old senatorial treasury) is sufficient evidence that this letter is a forgery.
