For no emperor may extend the pomerium save one who has added to the empire of Rome some portion of foreign territory.

Without actually rebelling against Roman rule, she had created what seems to have been virtually an independent kingdom. Encouraged, however, by Aurelian’s ill-success against the Alamanni, she determined on a definite break with Rome, and in the spring or early summer of 271 coins were issued in Antioch and Alexandria, bearing the portrait of her son Vaballathus, with the titles of <span class="italic">Imperator</span> and <span class="italic">Augustus</span>.
