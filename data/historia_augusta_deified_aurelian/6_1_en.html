of Aurelian had been a priestess. He was also presented with an elephant of unusual size, which he then gave to the emperor, and Aurelian was the only commoner of them all who ever owned an elephant.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_203_1" id="target_note_LCL263_203_1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>VI. But, to omit these and similar details, he was a comely man, good to look upon because of his manly grace, rather tall in stature, and very strong in his muscles; he was a little too fond of wine and food, but indulged his passions rarely; he exercised the greatest severity and a discipline that had no equal, being extremely ready to draw his sword. And, in fact, since there were in the army two tribunes, both named Aurelian, this man and another, who later was captured with Valerian, the soldiers gave him the nickname of “Sword-in-hand,”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_203_2" id="target_note_LCL263_203_2"><sup>2</sup></a> so that, if anyone chanced to ask which Aurelian had done anything or performed any exploit, the reply would be made “Aurelian Sword-in-hand,” and so he would be identified.</p>
<p>Many of the remarkable deeds which he did as a commoner are still well known: For instance, he and three hundred men of his garrison alone destroyed the Sarmatians when they burst into Illyricum. Theoclius,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_203_3" id="target_note_LCL263_203_3"><sup>3</sup></a> who wrote of the reigns of the Caesars, relates that in the war against the Sarmatians Aurelian with his own hand slew forty-eight men in a single day and that in the course of several days he slew over nine hundred and fifty, so that the boys even composed in his honour the following jingles and dance-ditties, to which they would dance on holidays in soldier fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="line">“Thousand, thousand, thousand we’ve beheaded now.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">One alone, a thousand we’ve beheaded now.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">He shall drink a thousand who a thousand slew.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line">So much wine is owned by no one as the blood which</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">he has shed.”</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></blockquote>
