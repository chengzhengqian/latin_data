<p>XVIII. Aurelian, in fact, commanded all the cavalry before he received the power and while Claudius was still ruling, after the leaders of the horse had incurred reproach for having fought rashly and without the Emperor’s orders.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_227_2" id="target_note_LCL263_227_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Aurelian, too, during that same time, fought with the greatest vigour against the Suebi<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_227_3" id="target_note_LCL263_227_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the Sarmatians<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_227_4" id="target_note_LCL263_227_4"><sup>4</sup></a>

According to Zonaras, xii. 26, Quintillus and Aurelian were proclaimed simultaneously, the former by the senate and the latter by the army. This would seem to mean that the army, recently victorious over the Goths, refused to acknowledge the unwarlike Quintillus and bestowed the imperial
power on its most competent general, then in Pannonia, whereupon Quintillus committed suicide (cf. c. xxxvii. 6).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_227_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_227_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_227_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>See <span class="italic">Claud.</span>, xi. 6–8.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_227_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_227_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_227_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>More correctly, Juthungi, akin to the Alamanni and, like them, living north of the upper Danube.
