<p>XXXV. I think that I should not omit what both the people remember and the truth of history has made current, namely, that Aurelian, at the time of his setting out for the East, promised, if he came back victorious, to give to the populace crowns weighing two pounds apiece; the populace, however, expected crowns of gold, and these Aurelian either could not or would not give, and so he had crowns made of the bread now called wheaten and gave one to each separate man, providing that each and every one might receive his wheaten bread every day of his life and hand on his right to his heirs.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_263_1a" id="target_note_LCL263_263_1a"><sup>1</sup></a> The same Aurelian, too, gave the allowance of pork to the Roman people which is given them also to-day.</p>

It was commemorated by issues of coins with the legends <span class="italic">Annona Aug</span>. and <span class="italic">Liberalitas Aug</span>.; see Matt.-Syd., v. p. 268, no. 21, and p. 290, no. 229. The cost was covered by additional appropriations from the revenues from Egypt, and the boatmen on the Nile and the Tiber were organised into compulsory guilds in order that the service might be improved; see c. xlv. 1 and xlvii. 1–3. This distribution, like that of pork, which was now added to the previous allowances of salt and oil (c. xlviii. 1), seems to have been due to the necessity of relieving the needs of Rome, impoverished by the economic decline of Italy and threatened with starvation; see Rostovtzeff, <span class="italic">Social and Econ.

As the result of lack of uniformity in coining and the absence of any fixed standard, the “Antoninianus” had become worthless. This coin was now replaced by a new piece, which not only was better made and contained more silver, but also bore a fixed relation (20:1) to a coin of definite value, perhaps the aureus or the denarius of real silver or even the reduced denarius; see Matt.-Syd., v. p. 9 f. Also a smaller coin (the denarius) and bronze coins (the sestertius and dupondius) were issued again after a lapse of many years.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_263_2').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
