<p>XXXI. It is a rare thing, or rather, a difficult thing, for the Syrians to keep faith. For the Palmyrenes, who had once been defeated and crushed, now that Aurelian was busied with matters in Europe, began a rebellion of no small size.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_255_2a" id="target_note_LCL263_255_2a"><sup>2</sup></a> For they killed Sandario, whom Aurelian had put in command of the garrison there, and with him six hundred bowmen, thus getting the rule for a certain Achilleus, a kinsman of Zenobia’s. But Aurelian, indeed, prepared as he always was, came back from Rhodope and, because it deserved it, destroyed the city. In fact, Aurelian’s cruelty, or, as some say, his sternness, is so widely known that they even quote a letter of his, revealing a confession of most savage fury<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_255_3" id="target_note_LCL263_255_3"><sup>3</sup></a>; of this the following is a copy:</p>

To whom, at this rate, shall we leave the land or the city? Those who still remain must be spared. For it is our belief that the few have been chastened by the punishment
