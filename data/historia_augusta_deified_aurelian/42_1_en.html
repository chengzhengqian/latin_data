<p>XL. How difficult it is to choose an emperor in the place of a good ruler is shown both by the dignified action of a revered senate and by the power exerted by a wise army. For when this sternest of princes was slain, the army referred to the senate the business of choosing an emperor,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_275_1" id="target_note_LCL263_275_1"><sup>1</sup></a> for the reason that it believed that no one of those should be chosen who had slain such an excellent ruler. The senate, however, thrust this selection back on the army, knowing well that the emperors whom the senate selected were no longer gladly received by the troops. Finally, for the third time, the choice was referred, and so for the space of six months the Roman world was without a ruler, and all those governors whom either the senate or Aurelian had chosen remained at their posts, save only that Faltonius Probus was appointed proconsul of Asia in the place of Arellius Fuscus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_275_2" id="target_note_LCL263_275_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>XLI. It is not without interest to insert the letter itself which the army sent to the senate:</p>
<p>“From the brave and victorious troops to the senate and the people of Rome. Aurelian our emperor has been slain through the guile of one man and the blunder of good and evil alike. Do you, now, our revered lords and Conscript Fathers, place Aurelian among the gods and send us as prince one of your own number, whom you deem a worthy man. For none of those who have erred or committed crime will we suffer to be our emperor.”</p>
<p>To this a reply was made by decree of the senate.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_275_3" id="target_note_LCL263_275_3"><sup>3</sup></a> When on the third day before the Nones of February<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_275_4a" id="target_note_LCL263_275_4a"><sup>4</sup></a>
