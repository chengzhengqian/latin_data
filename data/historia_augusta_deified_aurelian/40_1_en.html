<p>“From Aurelian Augustus to Ulpius his father. Just as though it were ordained for me by Fate that all the wars that I wage and all commotions only become more difficult, so also a revolt within the city has stirred up for me a most grievous struggle. For under the leadership of Felicissimus, the lowest of all my slaves, to whom I had committed the care of the privy-purse, the mint-workers have shown the spirit of rebellion. They have indeed been crushed, but with the loss of seven thousand men, boatmen,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_271_3" id="target_note_LCL263_271_3"><sup>3</sup></a> bank-troops, camp-troops<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_271_4" id="target_note_LCL263_271_4"><sup>4</sup></a> and Dacians. Hence it is clear that the immortal gods have granted me no victory without some hardship.”</p>

Victor, <span class="italic">Caes</span>., 35, 6; <span class="italic">Epit</span>., 35, 2, and Eutropius, ix. 14. According to these authors, the mint-workers, who, with the connivance of Felicissimus, had adulterated the metal appropriated for the coinage, fearing punishment, broke out into open war. It would appear that they had been keeping a part of the silver that was to have been used for the billon (<span class="italic">i.e</span>., adulterated) coins. Though the number of soldiers said to have fallen is, of course, greatly exaggerated, a battle seems to have been fought on the Caelian Hill, near the mint, which was on the Via Labicana. The date is uncertain; it may have been on the occasion of the German invasion of 270-271 (see c. xxi. 5) or in 274, just prior to the reform of the currency (see note to c. xxxv. 3).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_271_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_271_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_271_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>See c. x. 2 and note.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_271_2').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_271_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_271_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup><span class="italic">i.e.</span>, from the fleets on the Danube.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_271_3').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_271_4"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_271_4" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">4</sup>Terms applied in the fourth century to troops stationed in permanent garrisons along the bank of the Danube or in the <span class="italic">castra</span> on the frontier.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL263_271_4').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL263_271_5"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL263_271_5" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">5</sup>See <span class="italic">Tyr.
