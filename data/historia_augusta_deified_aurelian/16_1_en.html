Crinitus to adopt Aurelian, chiefly for the reason that he was poor; but this question I think should be left undiscussed.</p>
<p>Now, inasmuch as I have previously inserted the letter in accordance with which Aurelian was furnished with the money needed for his consulship, I have thought I should tell why I inserted a detail apparently trivial.

Concerning this matter there is great diversity of opinion among the historians, even among the Greeks, for some say that Aureolus was killed by Aurelian against Claudius’ will,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_223_5a" id="target_note_LCL263_223_5a"><sup>5</sup></a> others that it was by his
