in the battle near Antioch, after abandoning the city to Aurelian, fell back to the south along the Orontes to Emesa (Ḥoms), where the great battle of the war was fought. Zenobia’s troops, 70,000 strong, greatly outnumbered the Romans, and her cavalry drove the Roman horse from the field, but her infantry was badly defeated by Aurelian.
