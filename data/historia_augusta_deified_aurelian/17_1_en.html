But these things, too, we shall leave undiscussed, to be learned from those who have put them in writing. This much, however, is agreed among all, namely, that the Deified Claudius entrusted the whole conduct of the war against the Maeotidae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_225_1" id="target_note_LCL263_225_1"><sup>1</sup></a> to no one in preference to Aurelian.</p>
