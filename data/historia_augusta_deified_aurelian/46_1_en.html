<p>XLIV. Now Aurelian, indeed, is placed by many among neither the good nor the evil emperors for the reason that he lacked the quality of mercy, that foremost dower of an emperor. In fact, Verconnius Herennianus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_283_1" id="target_note_LCL263_283_1"><sup>1</sup></a> Diocletian’s prefect of the guard, used often to say—or so Asclepiodotus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL263_283_2" id="target_note_LCL263_283_2"><sup>2</sup></a> bears witness—that Diocletian, in finding fault with Maximian’s harshness, frequently said that Aurelian ought to have been a general rather than an emperor.
