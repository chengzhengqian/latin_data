And so as the opinion was approved by the assent of the majority, envoys were sent to the consul; they were heard in the presence of a full council. They asked for peace, promising that Perseus would pay the Romans as much tribute<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_485_1" id="target_note_LCL332_485_1"><sup>1</sup></a> as Philip had promised, and that he would yield with all speed the cities, land and places which Philip had yielded. So far the envoys. When after the withdrawal of the envoys the matter was discussed, Roman steadfastness<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_485_2" id="target_note_LCL332_485_2"><sup>2</sup></a> carried the day in the council. The custom of that age was to wear in misfortune the aspect of success and to be of temperate disposition in successes. It was decided to reply that peace would be granted on condition that the king should give to the senate the unconditional right of deciding on a general policy concerning the king himself and concerning all Macedonia.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_485_3a" id="target_note_LCL332_485_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> When the envoys reported these terms, to those ignorant of the Roman character their obstinacy was portentous, and many advised against any further reference to peace; for soon, they said, the Romans would of their own accord seek what they scorned when offered.

Polybius XXVII. 8. 7–10. “It was unanimously decided (by the Roman council) to give as severe a reply as possible, it being in all cases the traditional Roman custom to show themselves most imperious and severe in the season of defeat, and most lenient after success.
