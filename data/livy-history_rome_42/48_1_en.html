rich. When the military tribunes who were appointing <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 171</span>
centurions were assigning men as they came,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_387_1" id="target_note_LCL332_387_1"><sup>1</sup></a> twenty-three veterans who had held the rank of chief centurion<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_387_2" id="target_note_LCL332_387_2"><sup>2</sup></a> on being named appealed to the tribunes of the people. Two of these magistrates, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior and Marcus Claudius Marcellus, referred the matter back to the consuls; for, they said, the investigation belonged to those to whom the levy and the war had been committed; the other tribunes said they would investigate the matter of the appeal, and if wrong was being done, they would come to the aid of their fellow-citizens.</p>
<p>XXXIII. The investigation took place at the benches of the tribunes; thither came Marcus Popilius, the ex-consul, as counsel for the centurions, the centurions themselves, and the consul. At the request of the consul that this investigation take place before an assembly, the people were summoned to an assembly. On behalf of the centurions Marcus Popilius, who had been consul two years before, addressed the people as follows: These soldierly men had ended their regular military service and had also ended their physical vigour because of both age and unremitting labour; however, they offered no objection to contributing their services to the state. This one request they did make, that they should not be assigned ranks lower than those they had held during their regular service.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_387_3" id="target_note_LCL332_387_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Publius
