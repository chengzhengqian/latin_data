By this mutual recital of benefits the minds of the gathering were fired to vote everything which the Romans wished.</p>

Beginning with a mention of this relationship, the envoys asked that he give the king the opportunity of coming to confer with him. Marcius said both that he had been told by his father that a relationship of amity and hospitality had existed with Philip, and also that he had been by no means forgetful of this relationship when he undertook this embassy. As for a conference, if he were in sufficiently good health he would not think of deferring it; as it was, they would come, as soon as he was able, to the Peneus river, at the crossing between Homolium and Dium,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_405_3" id="target_note_LCL332_405_3"><sup>3</sup></a> after sending ahead messengers to inform the king.</p>
