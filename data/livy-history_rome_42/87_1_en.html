The raising of this siege gave room for another new siege; for immediately Marcus Lucretius with the naval force, ten thousand men-at-arms, and in addition the two thousand king’s men who were under Athenaeus, blockaded Haliartus; and while they were preparing also to assault it, the praetor joined them from Creüsa.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_465_1" id="target_note_LCL332_465_1"><sup>1</sup></a> At about the same time ships from the allies also assembled at Chalcis—two Carthaginian quinqueremes, two triremes from Heraclea on the Euxine, four from Chalcedon, as many from Samos, and also five quadriremes from Rhodes.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_465_2" id="target_note_LCL332_465_2"><sup>2</sup></a> These, since there was no naval warfare in any quarter, the praetor sent back to the allies.

When he discovered that they had not stirred at all because of this raid, he divided all the booty at least, only the human beings excepted—it consisted chiefly of all sorts of livestock—among his soldiers for feasting.</p>
