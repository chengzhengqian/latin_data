because they did not go to their province. Prompted by this harmony among the Fathers, Marcus Marcius Sermo and Quintus Marcius Scilla, tribunes of the people, first proclaimed that they would lay a fine upon the consuls if they should not go to their provinces, and then read in the senate the motion which they proposed to offer regarding the surrendered Ligurians. It was proposed that in case anyone of the surrendered Statellans had not been restored to liberty before the Kalends of August following, the senate should decree on oath<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_351_1" id="target_note_LCL332_351_1"><sup>1</sup></a> what officials should investigate this matter and punish the person by whose malice the aforesaid person had become a slave. Then, on the authorization of the senate, they published this decree. Before the consuls set out, an audience before the senate was granted to Gaius Cicereius, praetor of the preceding year, in the temple of Bellona. When he had set forth his achievements in Corsica<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_351_2" id="target_note_LCL332_351_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and had vainly demanded a triumph, he celebrated his triumph on the Alban Mount, which had now become customary<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_351_3a" id="target_note_LCL332_351_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> in order to permit the celebration of a triumph without the authorization of the state. The plebeian assembly voted and ordered the Marcian proposal regarding the Ligurians with complete unanimity. In accordance with this legislation the praetor Gaius Licinius consulted the senate as to whom they would choose to investigate under that bill. The Fathers ordered Licinius himself to conduct the investigation.</p>
