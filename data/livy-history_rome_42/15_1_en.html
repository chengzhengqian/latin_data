entreated both his colleague and the senate on behalf of his brother, declaring that if they passed any decree he would veto it. Aelius he discouraged from acting; the Fathers, enraged at both consuls alike for that reason, stood by their proposal the more vigorously. And so, when the question of provinces was taken up and Macedonia was sought after, because war with Perseus was now threatening, they decreed the Ligurians to both consuls; they refused to decree Macedonia unless the motion regarding Marcus Popilius were put to them. Then, when the consuls requested that they be authorized to enlist new armies or reinforcements for the old, both petitions were denied. The praetors also, who were asking for reinforcements for Spain, were refused, Marcus Junius for Nearer Spain, Spurius Lucretius for Farther Spain. Gaius Licinius Crassus had received the civil jurisdiction from the lots, Gnaeus Sicinius that between aliens, Sicily was assigned to Gaius Memmius, Sardinia to Spurius Cluvius. The consuls, angered at the senate for these reasons, proclaimed the Latin festival for the first available day and announced that they would set out to their province and would transact no public business except that which pertained to the government of the provinces.</p>

Claudius Quadrigarius was probably one of them. For similar choices by Livy between divergent accounts, cf. V. xlvi. 11, VIII. xviii. 2, XXI. xxviii. 6, and xxxviii. (here Livy uses better principles than elsewhere), XXI. xlvi. 10, XXXVIII. lv. 8, XXXIX. liii (a careful discussion, but see the note, voi. XI., p. 385).
