for his sending envoys to Rome; for none of them would be permitted to pass through Italy. After they were thus dismissed, instructions were given to Publius Licinius the consul to order them to depart from Italy within eleven days, and that he should send Spurius Carvilius to guard them until they boarded ship.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_399_1" id="target_note_LCL332_399_1"><sup>1</sup></a> These things took place at Rome before the consuls took the field.

Gnaeus Sicinius, who before giving up his office had been sent ahead to Brundisium to the fleet and army, had transported to Epirus five thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_399_2" id="target_note_LCL332_399_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and had encamped near the Place of the Nymphs<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_399_3a" id="target_note_LCL332_399_3a"><sup>3</sup></a> in the territory of Apollonia. Thence he sent tribunes with two thousand soldiers to hold forts of the Dassareti and of the Illyrians, since these peoples themselves requested garrisons, in order that they might be better protected against attack by their neighbours the Macedonians.</p>
<p>XXXVII. A few days later, Quintus Marcius, Aulus Atilius, Publius and Servius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Decimius, who had been sent as envoys to Greece, brought a thousand infantry with them to Corcyra; there they divided among themselves both the districts they were to approach,

It should be noted that the events next related actually precede those which Livy has been describing. Appian IX. xi. 5–9 mentions two embassies, the second of which is, as here, sent out of Italy. Both Appian and Polybius (XXVII. 6) say that all Macedonians were ordered to leave Italy, but on thirty days’ notice, which was also given the ambassadors (cf.

And nearby, on a hill, is a mine of asphalt; and the part that is trenched is filled up again in the course of time, since, as Poseidonius says, the earth that is poured into the trenches changes to asphalt.” (tr. H. L. Jones, L.C.L.) Nymphs dancing about the fire appeared on coins of Apollonia. A convent preserved the religious association in recent times. The asphalt deposits are still worked, and leakage of gas sometimes supplies the fire.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL332_399_3a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
