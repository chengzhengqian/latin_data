The censorship was harmonious and useful to the state. All those whom they expelled from the senate or whose horses they took away were transferred to the <span class="italic">aerarii</span><a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_319_2" id="target_note_LCL332_319_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and removed from their tribes; neither censor approved anyone who had been marked for censure by the other.
