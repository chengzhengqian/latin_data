sprang from confidence in their strength—and, increasing the sum of money, if perchance he might buy peace for a price, he did not cease to test the purpose of the consul. After the latter would make no change in the terms of his first answer, Perseus, giving up hope of peace, returned to Sycurium from whence he had set out, intending to try anew the fortunes of war.</p>
<p>LXIII. The report of the cavalry battle, as it spread abroad throughout Greece, laid bare the inclinations of the inhabitants. For not only partisans of Macedonia but many who were indebted to the Romans for huge benefits, and some few who had felt the violence and tyranny of Perseus, received this news gladly, for no other reason than the morbid eagerness which the mob feels in athletic contests also—the eagerness to cheer on the worse and weaker party.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL332_487_1a" id="target_note_LCL332_487_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

For there, when a humble and much inferior combatant is matched against a celebrated and seemingly invincible athlete, the sympathy of the crowd is at once given to the inferior man. They cheer him on, and back him up enthusiastically;
and if he manages to touch his opponent’s face, and gets in a blow that leaves any mark, there is at once again the greatest excitement among them all. They sometimes
even try to make fun of the other man, not out of any dislike for him or disapproval but from a curious sort of sympathy and a natural instinct to favour the weaker. If, however, one calls their attention at the right time to their error, they very soon change their minds and correct it. This was what Clitomachus did, as is told. He was considered to be a quite invincible boxer, and his fame had spread over the whole world, when Ptolemy, ambitious to destroy his reputation, trained with the greatest care and sent off the boxer Aristonicus,
a man who seemed to have a remarkable natural gift the men’s boxing-match? When Clitomachus had spoken thus, they say there was such a change in the sentiment of for this sport. Upon this Aristonicus arriving in Greece and challenging Clitomachus at Olympia, the crowd, it seems, at once took the part of the former and cheered him on, delighted to see that some one, once in a way at least, ventured to pit himself against Clitomachus. And when, as the fight continued, he appeared to be his adversary’s match, and once or twice landed a telling blow, there was great clapping of hands, and the crowd became delirious with excitement, cheering on Aristonicus. At this time they say that Clitomachus, after withdrawing for a few moments to recover his breath, turned to the crowd and asked them what they meant by cheering on Aristonicus and backing him up all they could. Did they think he himself was not fighting fairly, or were they not aware that Clitomachus was now fighting for the glory of Greece and Aristonicus for that of King Ptolemy? Would they prefer to see an Egyptian conquer the Greeks and win the Olympian crown, or to hear a Theban and Boeotian proclaimed by the herald as victor in the crowd that now all was reversed, and Aristonicus was beaten rather by the crowd than by Clitoinachus” (tr. Paton, L.C.L.).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL332_487_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
