Moreover, he learned new doctrines of divers schools—whatsoever in the Scythian land Anacharsis praised, all the gain that Sparta got with Lycurgus for her law-giver, all that the company of Cynics debates in the Erechthean gymnasium, copying the disciples of Epicurus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_21_2" id="target_note_LCL296_21_2">
