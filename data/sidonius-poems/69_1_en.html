As Avitus had not yet held any of the high offices of state which gave a right to the title, it must have been bestowed as an honorary distinction. It is somewhat surprising to find a Gallo—Roman reaching that dignity at such an early stage in his career. It is obvious that in this period he held a high military rank, and the Prefectship which soon followed shows that he was already a marked man. But as the Praetorian Prefect became <span class="italic">inlustris</span> as a matter of course, one is tempted to suspect that Sidonius has antedated the conferment of the title on Avitus.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_139_6').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
