</a> is now eager to gain approval by a new levy for this end, and feels not a burden wherein she beholds a benefit. The elder son of Atreus did not cover the Carpathian Sea with so many ships when the Dorian foe, bent on seizing the wealth of Sigeum, beleaguered Rhoeteian Pergamum; not so vast was the fleet that Xerxes had when he sought to link Sestos with Abydos and paved the swelling waters, setting a bridge over the breakers,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_101_2" id="target_note_LCL296_101_2">

</a> and with haughty step burst in upon the outraged flood, and his multitudinous squadrons pranced over the Hellespontine deep. Not so fully did the Mareotic fleet in Leucas’ harbour hide the waters of Actium, when a multitude that was a woman’s dower came from Egyptian Canopus to fight her husband’s battles, and proud Cleopatra, with her country’s sistrum girded upon her and her yellow boats loaded with pitch-black warriors, weighted the wide sea with the treasure of the Ptolemies. Thou dost not fight in this array, but rather as our forerunners did, with wealth of steel, whereto the wealthy coward’s gold submits. Yet scorn not such troublers of the peace, for these splendours, though they grace not the ranks of battle, grace the pageantry of a triumph. And truly I shall never grieve to have mentioned the house of Lagos as prototype of thy foe; for I forecast a like fate for these two kingdoms, since on their side the luxuriousness is equal, and on our side is a Caesar as good as there was then.</p>

Modern historians (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Hodgkin and Bury) absurdly imagine that the reference is to an expedition into Pannonia. The list of peoples in <span class="italic">vv.</span> 474–477 is a lurid commentary on Rome’s dependence upon foreign contingents to do her fighting, although Sidonius ingeniously turns a lamentable fact into a compliment to Majorian. The poet makes it abundantly clear that Majorian began early in his reign to organise an army and a navy for an attack on Geiseric in Africa. The muster here described has that ultimate end in view, though the troubles in Gaul had first to be settled.
