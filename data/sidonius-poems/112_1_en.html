Africa, now impossible to identify with certainty. It was near the Lesser Syrtes, with which it seems to have been united by a river, also called Tritonis. The lake is often associated with Pallas Athena, who is called Τριτογένεια, Tritonia, and Tritonis (see 7. 198 and below, <span class="italic">v.</span> 179).
