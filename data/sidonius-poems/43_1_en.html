<p>“So spake he, and ordered the fighter to exchange his wonted toil for his native fields; but fate’s revolving wheel was here at work, to the end that he might learn what is in store for the possessor of land and likewise what conduct the civil law creates, and so he might bring to the throne more than a soldier’s skill. Straightway he had hung up his armour, this veteran young in years, and was making the leanness of a barren land fruitful with the plough. Even so in old times thou wert wont, O Rome, to upturn thy fields by the work of a stooping consul, when peace had intervened for a little and thou hadst relaxed thy campaigning; and his stout left hand would control the plough after he had ruled the legions, while near the lowly hearth a peasant-conqueror’s palm-decked robe drank in the smoke.</p>

Petronius Maximus, who had instigated this murder in the vain hope of succeeding Aëtius as “the Patrician,” soon turned upon his imperial master and caused him to be assassinated on March 16, <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 455. On the following day he was proclaimed Emperor. A month and a half later he was killed as he sought flight before the Vandals’ advance on Rome. When Geiseric departed after plundering the capital, Avitus was proclaimed Emperor in Gaul, and he entered Rome before the end of the year, accompanied by our poet, his son-in-law. Scarcely a year later he was deposed by Ricimer and Majorian, and died shortly afterwards. After an interregnum he was succeeded, in the year 457, by Majorian, who would perhaps have been elevated two years before had not Petronius Maximus stood in his way. It must have been very hard for Sidonius to write this part of the poem. Avitus, of course, is not mentioned.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_87_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_87_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_87_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>After the death of Aëtius, Valentinian summoned Majorian from his retreat and made him <span class="italic">comes domesticorum.</span> The <span class="italic">palatini,</span> like the old Praetorian Guards, were stationed in various parts of Italy.
