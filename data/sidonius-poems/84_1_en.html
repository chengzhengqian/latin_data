</a> ’tis easy to feel sure even now of what he can do by waging war. How he shall, time and again, bring nations under thy yoke, dashing his eagles against them!—that man who as a subject shrank from the glorious omens of sovereignty, when it chanced that as he journeyed a startled bird struck from his shoulders the common cloak he wore. But now be of good cheer with such a man for Emperor, O Rome, ancient mother of gods; lift up thine eyes and cast off thine unseemly gloom. Lo! a prince of riper years shall bring back youth to thee, whom child-princes have made old.”</p>

Avitus was proclaimed Emperor in July and reached Rome in September, <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 455. There is no reason to believe that he took a long time over his journey; the statement sometimes made that he left Gaul in July has neither common sense nor ancient authority to support it. It is scarcely credible that he turned aside at this time to make a demonstration against the “barbarians” in Pannonia. He may have sent a force under one of his generals; it was quite in order to give the Emperor credit for a military success won under his auspices. If Avitus did not lead the expedition it may have taken place even after his arrival in Rome. It is, however, probable that <span class="italic">iter</span> means the journey of Avitus from Gaul to Rome, and that in the course of it there came some good news or friendly overtures from Pannonia, which Sidonius attributes to the prestige of the new Emperor and the fear produced by his journey southward.
