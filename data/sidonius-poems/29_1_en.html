</a> of old under the canopy of a spreading beech might pour forth his warblings breathed into the reed, Caesar vouchsafed him in his hour of distress the right to live and possess his land, and the wrath of majesty endured not against an humble offender.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_59_2" id="target_note_LCL296_59_2">

</a> But the rustic Muse, praising thus a bounteous prince for a farm restored, gave in return for that earthly boon a place in heaven; nor was such repayment with the gifts of Phoebus too poor a recompense, for whereas the one man had made the poet a master of lands, the poet made him a god. To Flaccus likewise, when he had followed the campaigns of Brutus and Cassius, he who was the source of his pardon was also the source of his song.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_59_3" id="target_note_LCL296_59_3">

</a> So it is with me; laid prostrate not long since in the ranks of thy foe, I was bidden by thee, my conqueror, to keep an unconquered spirit. So let the tongue of a poet thus preserved yield its service to thee, and let my praises be the recompense for my life. I will not now fix a malignant tooth in Maro or carp at the citizen of the Sabine country. My work must needs be less than theirs in talent, but it is greater in its Caesar. Let them surpass me in the power of utterance, so long as I surpass them in my lord and master.</p>
