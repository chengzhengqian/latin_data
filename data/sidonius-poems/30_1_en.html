<p>Picture to your minds, O Roman people, all your past triumphs; now a consul holds the imperial power, one whom the hauberk clothes no less than the purple, whose brow is wreathed with the diadem not through vain parade but through lawful power, and to whom as reward of his toils doth come the palm-decked robe<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_61_2" id="target_note_LCL296_61_2">

</a> after the victor’s palm. Now the fasces crown all the splendours of sovereignty, and the prince is magnified in the consul. Therefore jubilant Europe shouts a “bravo” for thee, echoing through sky and countryside and cities and waters, since thou who wert a conqueror art now greeted as ruler. I confess it, the world trembled with alarm while thou wert loth that thy victories should benefit thee, and with overmuch modesty wert grieved that thou didst deserve the throne, and so with a woful refusal wouldst not undertake to rule that which thou hadst deemed worth defending.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_61_3a" id="target_note_LCL296_61_3a">

<p>Rome, the warrior-goddess, had taken her seat. Her breast was uncovered, on her plumed head was a crown of towers, and behind her, escaping from under her spacious helmet, her hair flowed over her

The date of Majorian’s accession is a vexed problem; see Stein, p. 554 n. and N. Baynes in <span class="italic">Journ. Rom. Stud.</span> XII (1922), pp. 223 f. and XVIII (1928), pp. 224 f. The scanty evidence available seems to indicate that on April 1 he was proclaimed by the soldiers with the connivance of Leo, the eastern Emperor, but that his formal adoption by Senate, army and people did not take place until December 28. Sidonius (<span class="italic">v.</span> 388, <span class="italic">collega</span>) tells us that Leo gave his assent on the latter occasion. This was strictly necessary (see n. 5 on p. 7), and there seems to be no cogent reason for doubting the poet’s assertion. Stein rather arbitrarily takes the mention of Leo to refer to April 1, while implicitly admitting that the reference in the same sentence to “commons, Senate and army” applies only to December 28. The attitude of Leo does seem to have been wavering and baffling, and may well have made Majorian hesitate, but it is very doubtful if Majorian would have committed himself irrevocably on December 28 without at least a formal assent from the eastern Emperor.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_61_3a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
