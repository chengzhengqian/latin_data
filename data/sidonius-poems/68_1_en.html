and he granted all that was asked, marvelling at such great talent and astonished at such full-grown virtue in those boyish years, at such elderly speech on the lips of the suppliant youth.</p>
<p>“And now, O Rome, I would fain relate the battles wherein he commanded and the compacts he made with kings. Thy land of Gaul, buffeted by divers tempests of war, was bidden to give to the Gothic king sureties of peace, and among them, a noble hostage, went Theodorus.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_137_1a" id="target_note_LCL296_137_1a">

</a> Avitus, in loving duty to his kin, sought him out in the midst of the skin-clad
monarch’s court, and his loyalty won him safety. Theodoric soon looked with favour on this sublime devotion. Marvellous indeed is it and worthy to be recorded that by thy gentle winsomeness, Avitus, thou didst find grace with a fierce king. Little by little he began to know thee in his inmost soul, and he desired exceedingly to have thee as one of his own; but thou didst scorn to act the friend rather than the Roman. The king marvelled at this rebuff, but esteemed thee all the more for it. Even thus did Pyrrhus see Fabricius immovable, when that poor man with rich soul shunned the riches thrust upon him, despising the king in that he made his wealth play the suppliant and begged with paltry gold for a bond of friendship.</p>

It is scarcely likely that he is the man mentioned in <span class="italic">Epist.</span> III. 10. 1. The Gothic king is Theodoric I (419–451). It is thought that the hostages referred to here were given to him on the occasion of his treaty with the Romans which gave him sovereignty over Aquitanica Secunda and Novempopulana (Introd., p. xvii). This is possible if we accept one of the two dates usually given for that agreement (426 and 430), but not if, with Stein (p. 482), we place it in 439. The giving of hostages does not necessarily imply that the Gothic kingdom was now independent; see Stein, <span class="italic">loc. cit.</span>, n. 3. See also n. on 495 sqq. Some eminent historians (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Mommsen) have erred seriously through ignorance of the meaning of <span class="italic">expetis</span> (<span class="italic">v.</span> 219). In Sidonius and other late Latin writers this verb often means “seek out,” “visit.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_137_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
