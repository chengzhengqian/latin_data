</a> Elsewhere is seen Mimas flinging Lemnos against the aegis in a brother’s defence, while the island-missile
shakes heaven with its impact. In yet another part is the multiple Briareus with his much-peopled
body joining in the fray, carrying in his person a whole host all akin; you could see his hands on branching arms sprouting from a single source. To these monsters Vulcan had given by his skill not only forms but frenzy, so that he trembled at the very wrath which his art had counterfeited.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_227_2" id="target_note_LCL296_227_2">

The first temple is a home of philosophy, where Polemius learns all the doctrines of the sages; the second (described in <span class="italic">vv.</span> 126 sqq.) is devoted to the textile arts, and there Araneola sits, doing wonderful embroidery. Her subjects are mostly taken from the love-stories of mythology. The goddess indicates that she prefers the subjects which are cultivated in the other temple; whereupon Araneola mischievously begins to depict a philosopher (Diogenes the Cynic) in a ridiculous situation. The goddess, unable to restrain a smile, says, “You are not going to laugh at philosophers any longer; you are going to marry one.” For an ingenious but unconvincing attempt to identify and locate the two “temples” see A. von Premerstein
