As for these measures of my sadly barren muse, I rarely commit them to a papyrus-sheet, and then only to a short one,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_197_2" id="target_note_LCL296_197_2">

And yet I shall not dread excessively the pompous mouthing of an abusive reader, should he, with an air of superior gravity and sternness, like a third Cato, spurn the jesting of my Terpsichore, purse his lips and threaten me with the contemptuous nose of a rhinoceros. Let not this too consummate pundit frighten you. If you would get at the real truth, believe me, nobody knows as many things as he doesn’t know.</p>
