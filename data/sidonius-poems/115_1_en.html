</a> Thus all the tones that have been given forth by harp and lyre and flute and voice follow, he declares, the intervals of the seven planets, the pitch of the sounds being assigned after this pattern according to the dictates of proportion. He also calls by the name of harmony the arrangement of the four elements, which are so placed that those of great weight have the lowest place in the earth at the centre (It is clear that in a round shape what is absolutely the middle must be the lowest part); hence it comes about that water, which is lighter, springs up above the land, and higher than both is air, which is purer and thus soars over them, while sky, with its extreme lightness, encloses all these, and at the same time this whole universe takes its poise from the centre. In this temple also Thales inquires by calculations concerning the heavenly bodies how to announce beforehand the eclipse of the sun and the travail of the moon; but he assigns to things a vain first principle, believing that the universe is evolved from water. His pupil<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_231_2a" id="target_note_LCL296_231_2a">

<span class="italic">Myrae</span> or <span class="italic">moerae</span> are segments of the zodiacal circle, which extends from tropic to tropic. The sun traverses thirty of these in about a month. Had Sidonius been speaking of the sun there would have been no difficulty; but he seems to be confusing these solar degrees with the (approximately) 30 days of the moon’s monthly revolution.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_231_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_231_2a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_231_2a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Anaximander; but Sidonius in this passage gives a rough summary of doctrines usually associated with Anaxagoras: the primal chaos contained an infinite number of particles, or “seeds” of things; these became separated off, like becoming united with like (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> gold particles with gold particles): everything in the world consists predominantly of particles of the same nature as itself (miniatures of itself as it were)—this is the doctrine of <span class="italic">homoiomereia,</span> as it was called by Aristotle and others.

The ancients often attribute Anaxagorean doctrines to Anaximander, and it is not easy to draw a rigid line between the tenets of the two philosophers; but Anaxagoras seems really to have been more influenced by Anaximenes than by Anaximander.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_231_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
