<p>Why—even supposing I had the skill—do you bid me compose a song dedicated to Venus the lover of Fescennine mirth, placed as I am among long-haired hordes, having to endure German speech, praising oft with wry face the song of the gluttonous Burgundian
who spreads rancid butter on his hair? Do you want me to tell you what wrecks all poetry? Driven away by barbarian thrumming the Muse has spurned the six-footed exercise ever since she beheld these patrons seven feet high. I am fain to call your eyes and ears happy, happy too your nose, for you don’t have a reek of garlic and foul onions discharged upon you at early morn from ten breakfasts, and you are not invaded even before dawn, like an old grandfather or a foster-father, by a crowd of giants so many and so big that not even the kitchen of Alcinous could support them.</p>
<p>But already my Muse is silent and draws rein after only a few jesting hendecasyllables, lest anyone should call even these lines satire.</p>

In that letter, which has reference to a supposed “satire” of Sidonius, Catullinus plays an amusing part, and it is fairly obvious that <span class="italic">v.</span> 22 contains a reference to the incident, which occurred at Arles in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 461. The poem may have been written at Aries some time after Catullinus
had left. The reference to the Burgundians is not quite clear. Sidonius seems to imply that he was responsible for feeding a certain number of them. Were they members of a Burgundian contingent in the forces of Majorian? Hodgkin (II. 362), though adopting the above view of <span class="italic">v.</span> 21 and the consequent dating of the poem, conjectures that these verses were written at Lyons—presumably because Lyons was in (though not part of) the Burgundian territory; but he does not explain the reference to the Burgundian meals. For an account of various suggested dates and places see Stevens, p. 66, n. 1. For the superscription of this poem see n. on <span class="italic">Epist.</span> I. 11. 3.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_213_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
