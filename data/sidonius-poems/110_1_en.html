the author of a fine book “On the natal Day.” 4. Here also you are going to read a novel word, essentia; but you must note that Cicero himself has used that word; for he introduced the two terms <span class="italic">essentia</span> and <span class="italic">indoloria,</span>

</a> adding: “for it is allowable to apply new names to new notions.” And he was quite right, for just as we form, for example, the nouns <span class="italic">sapientia</span> and <span class="italic">intellegentia</span> from <span class="italic">sapere</span> and <span class="italic">intellegere,</span> so quite legitimately we do not refrain from using <span class="italic">essentia</span> from <span class="italic">esse.</span> Therefore, since my interest in your love-affair has led me, a man of Gaul, to introduce such matter as belongs to the philosophical lecture-room, I claim you in a special degree as intercessor on my behalf. Let Venus and all the fictitious gallery of love-gods be bestowed on one who cannot be eulogised in the manner of this poem. Farewell.</p>

                  <span class="italic">essentia</span> (a translation of oὐσία, “being”) was first used by a philosopher called Plautus (this seems to be the correct form, but the MSS. vary). Cicero uses <span class="italic">indolentia,</span> but it is scarcely credible that he ever used <span class="italic">indoloria</span>. Both these words are renderings of the Greek word ἀναλγησία, “insensibility,” literally “freedom from pain.” The form <span class="italic">indoloria</span> is used by Jerome and Augustine.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_221_2a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_221_3"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_221_3" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">3</sup>For Araneola see n. on 9. 6.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_221_3').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
