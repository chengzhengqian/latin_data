There was a narrow passage at the junction of two ways, and a road crossed both the village of Helena, which was within bowshot, and the river, where that long but narrow path was supported by girders.

Helena has not been identified with certainty; most historians now seem to favour Hélesmes (Dép. Nord); other possibilities are Vieil-Hesdin and Lens. The above rendering is given with some diffidence, but seems preferable to any other that has been offered. The meaning is that a narrow road ran from the cross-roads through the village and was continued over the bridge which spanned the river.

The incident here related (for which Sidonius is the only authority) is usually dated a.d. 428 (“about the year 431,” C. M. H.). This dating is quite incompatible with the mention in v. 205 of Gaudentius (born about 440), taken in conjunction with the repeated insistence on the extreme youth of Majorian (who was, indeed, still <span class="italic">iuvenis</span> at the time of his accession: see v. 524); needless to say, it is also incompatible with the usual explanation of the reference to Tours (see the last note).
