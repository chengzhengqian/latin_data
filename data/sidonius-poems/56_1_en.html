Emperor, ’tis pleasant to remember the evil days. Prostrated though we are by devastation and by fire, thou by thy coming dost restore all things; and since we were the cause of thy triumph, our very fall is pleasing. When thou shalt step into the victor’s chariot and after the manner of our forefathers the mural, castrensian and civic crowns shall entwine thy sacred hair, and the golden Capitol shall behold kings in chains; when thou shalt clothe Rome with spoils and shalt depict in costly wax the captured huts of some African Bocchus,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_113_1" id="target_note_LCL296_113_1">

</a> then I myself will walk before thee amid the obstructing throngs and the clamour of hoarse shouts, and in my puny strain, as now, I will tell how thou hast subdued two Alpine ranges,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_113_2" id="target_note_LCL296_113_2">
<sup>2</sup>
</a> the Syrtes, the Great Sea, the narrower waters, and the Libyan hordes; but first I will tell how thou didst conquer for my benefit. I am fain to leap for joy that thou dost turn thine eyes and already regardest the unfortunate with brightened countenance. I remember well, when thou wert minded to be merciful, such was ever thy look; a benign graciousness gives the sign. Grant my prayer: so may Byrsa<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_113_3" id="target_note_LCL296_113_3">
<sup>3</sup>
</a> draw breath again through thy victories; so may the Parthian flee in good earnest and the Moor go his way white with fear; so may Susa tremble and the Bactrians lay aside their quivers and stand disarmed around thy tribunal!</p>
