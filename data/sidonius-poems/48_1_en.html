Some land their well-trained steeds in hollow skiffs, some don the meshed mail of like hue to themselves, some get ready their shapely bows and the arrows made to carry poison on the iron point and to wound doubly with a single shot. Now the broidered dragon<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_97_1a" id="target_note_LCL296_97_1a">

Now the trumpet’s deep note sounds with terrific blast; a responsive shout greets the clarions, and even the puny spirit of cowards suddenly bursts into frenzy.
