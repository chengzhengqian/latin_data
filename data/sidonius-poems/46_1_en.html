</a> my land of Gaul hath even till now been ignored by the lords of the world, and hath languished in slavery unheeded. Since that time much hath been destroyed, for with the emperor, whoe’er he might be, closely confined,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_93_2" id="target_note_LCL296_93_2">

Maximus invaded Italy in 387 in order to attack Valentinian II (half-brother of Gratian), who fled to the East.
