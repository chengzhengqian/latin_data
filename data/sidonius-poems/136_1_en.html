no tortoise-roof, no mantlet, no wheel rushing onwards with ladders already in position shall ever have power to shake. Methinks I see the future that is in store for thee, O Castle (for so thou shalt be called). The house rises from the river’s brim and gleaming baths are set within the circuit of the battlements: here when the surging waters are troubled by the murky north-wind, the eaten, jagged rock sends forth a roar from the scarred bank; then from a cleft in the crags a torrent leaps forth and is shot aloft, showering spray on to the very roofs; it lifts up men in boats and often mocks them with a sportive shipwreck; for when the storm is over the flood retreats and strands whole fleets that have been forced up into the baths.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_273_1" id="target_note_LCL296_273_1">

</a> But the columns that support the baths, of what manner and size are they? Before them must bow the costly dark hue in the purple quarry of Synnada and the Numidian hill that bears stones like ivory and the marble that burgeons with grass-like veins; henceforth I spurn gleaming Paros and Carystos; poorer now seems the purple suspended in the blushing rock.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_273_2" id="target_note_LCL296_273_2">

Sidonius is writing to one who knew the house, and he is more intent on ingenious conceits than on intelligibility. <span class="italic">Paries</span> (146) is possibly the front wall of the house, on the inner side of which is the atrium. The decorative slabs (<span class="italic">vv.</span> 146 f.) are on the inside of the wall. <span class="italic">Vv.</span> 150–155 describe the atrium, which each row turns inward for a short distance (<span class="italic">obversis</span> = “turning athwart” or “turning so as to face one another”), and thus “looks back upon” the “double colonnade.” The winding pillars on each side form the <span class="italic">alae.</span> Sidonius welcomed the word because it made a ludicrous combination with <span class="italic">cornibus</span> (“wings” and “horns”). <span class="italic">Duplici . . . plaustro</span> means “not exposed to the north.” is crescent-shaped (<span class="italic">lunata atria,</span> 157). With much diffidence I have made two alterations in the text. The meaning may be that a <span class="italic">porticus duplex, i.e.</span> a double row of pillars, runs straight through from the entrance, thus dividing the floor into “two floor-spaces.” At the far end the two rows bend round in opposite directions, following the rounded wall until they come near to the <span class="italic">paries</span> from which they started.
