</a> who thought that our air produces all things, and who declares that the gods also have a like origin. Fourth in the line is Anaxagoras,
who upholds the dogmas of Thales<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_233_2" id="target_note_LCL296_233_2">

</a> but he, believing air to be the substance from which all creatures come, judges that thence God derived the wherewithal to create everything. After them Arcesilas<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_233_4" id="target_note_LCL296_233_4">

</a> guesses that this great world-mass
is produced by a divine mind but is made up of those particles which he himself calls light atoms. After him shines forth the Socratic school, which passed from natureâ€™s massive fabric and transferred its practice to enhancing the moral life of mankind. This school they say the peerless Plato adorned, but he moulded it after a triple pattern,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_233_5a" id="target_note_LCL296_233_5a">

</a> For stones, he says, do but exist, and are clearly proved to do naught but exist; next come those things which manifestly both exist and live, but to which you could ascribe no further attribute, trees and plants; the third kind of being is found in the beasts, in whom existing and living are accompanied by motion and sensation; next the fourth creation favours his own fellow-mortals, to whom are given the gifts of existence, movement, life, and sensation, whereto is added the crowning gift of discernment
