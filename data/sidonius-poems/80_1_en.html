the insurgent crowd, condemning war, raised a friendly uproar. Then out spake the king: ‘O leader renowned, I have long been blaming thee for begging peace from us when thou hast power to enforce bondage and draw willing peoples to war in thy train. I beseech thee, brand me not with obloquy by bringing up my father’s name. What blame can be mine if thou give me no orders? What thou mightest have advised in his day thou needst now but desire; the only hindrance is that the Goths have not learnt what thou wouldst have.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_161_1" id="target_note_LCL296_161_1">

</a> Thanks to thee the laws of Rome have long been pleasing to me; when I was a child my father bade me learn lines by heart at thine instruction, that those strains of Virgil’s ancient page, taught to thy willing pupil, might soften my Scythian ways; even then thou didst teach me to desire peace. But hear now the terms of my obedience, and perhaps thou wilt be pleased to sanction a compact. I swear, O Rome, by thy name, revered by me, and by our common descent from Mars<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_161_2" id="target_note_LCL296_161_2">

Between that year and 435, when Avitus took part in the war against the Burgundians, the Goths seem to have been comparatively quiet, and Avitus may have remained at the Gothic court for a considerable time, acting as tutor to the young prince. There is no need to assume any further sojourn among the Goths, apart from the official missions described in this poem.
