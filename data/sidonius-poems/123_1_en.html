<span class="italic">Coloss.</span> 2. 14. The Greek is ἐξαλείψας τὸ καθ᾿ ἡμῶν χειρόγραφον τοῖς δόγμασιν and the Latin (Vulgate) is <span class="italic">delens quod adversus nos erat chirographum decreti.</span> These very difficult words have been much discussed both by the ancient Fathers and by modern theologians. Sidonius was no theologian, but there is perhaps something to be said for his interpretation: man had by his fall been, as it were, compelled to sign a bond whereby he was made over to the devil in default of paying a seemingly impossible ransom; Christ has made himself the ransom.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_247_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_247_2a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_247_2a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>
<span class="italic">Pervasus</span> is very difficult. In legal Latin and in many late authors <span class="italic">pervadere, pervasio,</span> and <span class="italic">pervasor</span> are used with reference to an act of wanton appropriation. The act may be a flagrant theft (property stolen from a church is called <span class="italic">pervasa</span> in Paulin. Petricord. <span class="italic">Vit. Mart.</span> VI. 247) or the unlawful occupation of a dwelling. In the latter meaning we find <span class="italic">pervadere and pervasor</span> used metaphorically by Christian writers with reference to demoniac possession. In this sense the devil is called <span class="italic">pervasor</span> by Paulinus, <span class="italic">op. cit.</span> VI. 44; the same metaphor (probably suggested by <span class="italic">Matth.</span> 12. 29, Luke 11. 24) is developed more fully by Sedulius in relating the story of the boy possessed by an unclean spirit (<span class="italic">Matth.</span> 17. 14–18, <span class="italic">Mark</span> 9. 17–27, <span class="italic">Luke</span> 9. 38–42, A.V. numbering): Christ compels the spirit <span class="italic">pervasa migrare domo</span> (<span class="italic">Pasch. Carm.</span> III. 309; so in the prose version, <span class="italic">Pasch. Op.</span> III. 25, <span class="italic">pervasae domus habitaculo migraturus</span>). Sidonius may have had this image in his mind: in virtue of the “bond” the Evil One has seized possession of man and made of him a dwelling-place. On the other hand the meaning of <span class="italic">pervasus</span> here may be simply “seized,” “snatched away,” “stolen.” The translation given attempts to cover both meanings.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_247_2a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
