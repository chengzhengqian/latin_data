I, who complained aforetime that the world’s limits were too narrow, am now not even a boundary to myself.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_127_1" id="target_note_LCL296_127_1">

an emperor gallant, faithful, righteous and vigorous. In my captivity I pray for such another. I know not if anyone can match Trajan—unless perchance Gaul should once more<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_127_6" id="target_note_LCL296_127_6">
