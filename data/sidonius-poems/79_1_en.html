But as Maximus, late sovereign of our western world, after a thousand refusals from our chieftest men, summoned me, all unsuspecting and far away, to serve amid the clarions of war after controlling the laws, and ordained that I should now hear the blaring trumpets instead of the court-usher’s voice, then did I right readily embrace the duty, that I might go as ambassador to you. I crave of you the old treaty, which even now that aged man, my one-time friend,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_159_1" id="target_note_LCL296_159_1">

In former days I was wont to guide the doings of the Goths; thou knowest that my counsel was often acted on before thou wert aware of it. But fate hath taken away from me my guardian-spirit of former days, and all my services have faded from sight along with thy father. He had surrounded Narbo,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_159_2" id="target_note_LCL296_159_2">
