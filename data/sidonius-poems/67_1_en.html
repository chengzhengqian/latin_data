</a> to learn by the guidance of their nostrils that wild beasts he could not see were lurking in the den, and to seek for tracks in the air? Again, if haply the irrepressible Umbrian hound frightened a boar by his barking, it was sport to this lad to smash the white crescents under the monster’s black throat and with straining arm to drive a huge spear through the confronting quarry. What a beautiful sight when, returning home from the chase, he would appear all the more resplendent for the boar’s bristling hideousness, and his gallantry in its own despite baulked his shrinking modesty by this evidence of brave deeds! Thus in the Pandionian fields of chaste Tritonis<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_135_2" id="target_note_LCL296_135_2">

</a> Who more skilfully trains them to clash in divers contests amid the clouds? With a bird he vanquishes birds; with a swift whirring through the upper air the warrior claw fights for none more gallantly than for him.</p>
<p>“And amid these sports he followed the law none the less, and, young though he was, he was chosen first and alone to bind up the wounds of his shattered homeland and to make claim for the abolishment of a hideous tax.

He does not actually say that Constantius was in Gaul at the time, and some have supposed that the embassy went to Ravenna, where Constantius was persuaded to use his influence with Honorius. But the description of Constantius as <span class="italic">potentior illic</span> seems to imply that he was commanding in of Jovinus in the land of the Arvernians, but Sidonius can scarcely be alluding to such an early date (Jovinus fell in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 413). Constantius was so often and so long in Gaul that we cannot fix the reference with any certainty. If the <span class="italic">vectigal</span> was a tax levied by the government, only the Emperor could remit it, and we must then suppose that Avitus persuaded Constantius to use his influence with Honorius to that end. It may, however, refer to the requisitions for the pay and provisioning of the army (<span class="italic">annona militaris</span>). Gaul.
