<p>This petition thy suppliant servant has offered, waiting for a kind and life-giving answer. That thou mayest give him back his native town and his life withal, releasing Lugdunum from its fallen estate—this
thy Sidonius craves of thee: so may the purple, redipped in Sidonian dye, clothe thee for many a year; so, when thou hast completed a lustre of thine everlasting reign, may a quinquennial festival be consecrated to thy rule; so may the Sygambrian, when the commotion on both banks has been quelled, drink the waters of Vachalis with head shorn in humiliation. If thou grant this to thy poet, I will commit<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_217_1" id="target_note_LCL296_217_1">

</a> to history’s undying records, to be read of mankind, all the exploits of thy glorious triumphs. For now my talkative muse is silenced by the tax, and culls instead of Virgil’s and Terence’s lines the pence and halfpence owed to the Exchequer, and fears the hand and rope of Marsyas,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_217_2" id="target_note_LCL296_217_2">

</a> who from his old-time hatred of Phoebus now threatens bards with hanging.</p>

<p>1. My devoted brother Polemius,</p>
<p>After your departure I considered carefully how far I was entitled to sing a Fescennine strain in celebrating the wedding of a philosopher like you.
