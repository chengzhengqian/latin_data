</a> when salvation of a sudden burst upon them who had long been covered up, and a flood of life poured into them and swept their re-knit ashes from the tomb—</p>
<p>
<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">68</span><span class="br"></span>Do thou grant that I may praise thy servant Faustus, that I may pay my debt of gratitude, which even after this payment I am glad to owe. Thee, great priest, this lyre of mine doth hymn, albeit with a quill unequal to the task.</p>
<p>The first cause and burden of my praises is that when my brother<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_249_2" id="target_note_LCL296_249_2">

</a> was at an age that is prone to slip his virtue was preserved with thy help through the grace of our Lord, and stands approved—yea, and with no wavering in his good report. This blessing in all its immensity is to be ascribed to thee; the reward will be due to him, but he will be due to thee.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_249_3" id="target_note_LCL296_249_3">

I praise thee too because when I came aforetime to Reii, while Procyon was raging and the sun’s parching fire was marking the thirsty fields with winding cracks, thy hospitality straightway greeted my hot discomfort with peace, home, shade, water, benediction, bed, and board. But a far greater boon than all these was that thou wert willing for me to approach also the hallowed threshold of the hallowed mother.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_249_4" id="target_note_LCL296_249_4">
