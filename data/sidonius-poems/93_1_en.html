votaries beside the incense-burning altar.</p>
<p>Not here shall you behold the Hesiodic strains of sluggish Ascra or Pindar’s lyre; nor the jests of Menander, wearer of comedy’s sock; nor the savage lampoons of the injured Archilochus; nor the graver muse of Stesichorus or the song fashioned by the Lesbian maid; nor that which Mantua, defying Homer’s supremacy, added to Latin utterance—Mantua, soon jealous that Parthenope matched her by possessing Virgil’s tomb; nor the notes that Horace was fain to sound when he penned the praises of Phoebus and roaming Diana after the medleys of the Epistles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_187_2" id="target_note_LCL296_187_2">

Bacchus is so represented in Sen. <span class="italic">Phaedr</span>.756, and Sidonius may have had a confused recollection of that passage. By <span class="italic">Syrtes</span> here Sidonius may mean “the land near the Syrtes”; the Roman poets are always ready to bring any Libyan lands near to those famous gulfs; see 5. 263 sq. and Lucan IV. 673, <span class="italic">confinis Syrtibus Hammon.</span> He may, however, be alluding to the fact, that the land extending from the Syrtes to the oasis of Ammon had formerly been covered by the sea; see Strabo I, 3. 4.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_187_1').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_187_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_187_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>Sidonius seems to be playing on the word <span class="italic">satura</span> by using it in its old sense of “medley” and applying it to the <span class="italic">Epistles,</span> not the <span class="italic">Satires,</span> of Horace. Horace refers to his Satires as <span class="italic">saturae</span> as well as <span class="italic">sermones</span>. In Suetonius’ life of the poet a phrase from the <span class="italic">Epistles</span> is said to occur in <span class="italic">saturis</span>; but this is probably an inadvertence, though Hendrickson in <span class="italic">Am.

Phil.</span> XVIII (1897), pp. 313–324, uses it, along with the present passage (wrongly punctuated with commas after <span class="italic">saluras</span> and <span class="italic">sales</span>) and other inconclusive evidence, to prove that the ancients assigned the <span class="italic">Epistles</span> as well as the <span class="italic">Satires</span> to the literary <span class="italic">genre</span> called <span class="italic">satura</span> (or <span class="italic">satira</span>).
