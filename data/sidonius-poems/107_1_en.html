<p>Hallowed antiquity records that the son of Amphitryon by succouring earth earned heaven as his reward. But although with grim look he crushed within his bare arms the tawny<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_215_2" id="target_note_LCL296_215_2">

</a> throat of the monster of Cleonae; although with his fiery sword he just availed to lay the hydra low, as one death ever brought forth two lives from the wound; although he carried the captured monster from the Erymanthian forest, laughing at the wild boar’s disarmed mouth; and although, bursting open the smoking neck of the fire-born thief, he compelled the cows at last to go frontwise; although the bull, the deer, the giant, the host, the wrestler, the Amazon, the Cretan beast, the dog, and the Hesperides<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_215_3" id="target_note_LCL296_215_3">

</a> are memorials of the hero’s prowess—yet none of his fights takes rank before the overthrow of Geryon, from whose one body he took three heads. Thus Alcides of old; but do thou, as a second Hercules, and our sovereign to boot, and our great God’s greatest care—thou, whose arrows made snake, stag, and boar alike to feel thy prowess,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_215_4" id="target_note_LCL296_215_4">

</a> and the tax to be the monster, and favour me by taking from it three heads, that I may be able to live.</p>

The method adopted was apparently to assess each man on an increased number of <span class="italic">capita</span> (property-units on which taxation was calculated). The “three heads” in this poem seem to mean that the taxes were trebled; or they may even have been quadrupled by the addition of three <span class="italic">capita</span> to every former one. Sidonius here pleads for a remission on behalf of himself and (less obviously) of others. His appeal was probably successful, otherwise he would scarcely have included it in his collected poems. It was probably written very soon after the Panegyric.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_215_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_215_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_215_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>This is probably the meaning of <span class="italic">rava</span> here.
