The land of the Thracians, whereon Rhodope and Haemus rest, is thine, a region fruitful of heroes. Here children are born into a world of ice, and their native snow hardens the soft limbs of infants even from the mother’s womb.

<span class="italic">Plus</span> often usurped the functions of <span class="italic">magis,</span> as <span class="italic">magis</span> usurped those of <span class="italic">potius. Sed magis</span> is used for “but rather” even in the poetry of the classical period. Here <span class="italic">sed plus</span> has the same meaning. <span class="italic">Plus quam</span> is sometimes found in the sense of <span class="italic">potius quam.</span> Another use of <span class="italic">plus = magis</span> is to form comparatives (<span class="italic">e.g. v.</span> 33 above).
