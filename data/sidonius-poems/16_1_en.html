tarry thus for long within the rampart, because thy soldiers went not forth into the fields in regular or stealthy raids. Though oft they lacked corn and always wine, they lacked not discipline; hence though the foe was nigh they feared their general more. So at length it came to pass that he who chanced to be thine ally then but straightway played thee false gained nothing when he retreated before the foe at the first onset; for when he had begun to flee, turning aside and laying bare the wings, thou didst stand thy ground, a host in thyself; to thee did those warriors rally whom their captain’s flight had scattered, back to thee came the cavalry as thou didst toil and sweat, fighting on foot; and following thy standards the soldiers felt that they were not deserted in the fray.</p>
<p>Go to now, ancient generation of our fathers! Proclaim, if ye will, the praises of old Tullus, for that he lied in a noble exhortation and concealed the collapse of the treaty with the deserter Mettus!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_33_1" id="target_note_LCL296_33_1">

</a> Thy will is done, and straightway the deserter has suffered the death decreed and has fallen—thy victim, though slain by a foreign sword. Come now, Antiquity! Enter the contest once more, if it please thee!
