</a> The swoop of forked lightning, the arrow sped by Scythian string, the trail of the swiftly-falling star, the leaden hurricane of bullets whirled from Balearic slings has never so rapidly split the airy paths of the sky. The ground gives way under the wheels and the air is smirched with the dust that rises in their track. The drivers, while they wield the reins, ply the lash; now they stretch forward over the chariots with stooping breasts, and so they sweep along, striking the horses’ withers and leaving their backs untouched. With charioteers so prone it would puzzle you to pronounce whether they were more supported by the pole or by the wheels. Now as if flying out of sight on wings, you had traversed the more open part, and you were hemmed in by the space that is cramped by craft, amid which the central barrier has extended its long low double-walled structure.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_307_2" id="target_note_LCL296_307_2">

The coveted position was the inside one, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the one nearest to the <span class="italic">spina,</span> which gave the shortest course. On this occasion Consentius’ partner has the inside position and Consentius the next. The two opponents get so far ahead of Consentius that they are entitled to move inward in front of him, and he has to change over to the outside position (363 sq.). Having gained this advantage, the two opponents hope that the horses of Consentius’ partner will swerve outward far enough to allow one of his enemies to dash in and that all’s fair in the circus, rushes up as close as possible to the inside car as it passes the turning-post, and succeeds in exciting the horses, so that they plunge wildly and take a crooked course. Consentius watches his opportunity, gains the inside position, and dashes ahead (394–399).</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_307_3b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
