Then he delivered his message of entreaty, and the goddess, compliant, made ready for the journey. Stern was her look as she bound up her flowing hair; then she shut in her towers and hid them under a helmet; laurel formed her fillet. Her belt, rough with shield-studs taken from enemies, made fast a sword, which rose high on her left side. Her conquering arm was thrust into a shield, whose orb was filled with the twin sons of Mars, with the wolf and Tiber and Love and Mars and Ilia. A clasp fixes with gripping tooth the raiment that retreats back from her breast. Her threatening spear flashes, and an oak bowed down with trophies sways and tires the goddess under its welcome burden. The covering of her sole is of one piece,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_43_1a" id="target_note_LCL296_43_1a">

</a> but this strip is not carried beyond the tips of the toes; the great toe sends two strings upward from its encircled socket in opposite directions, so that they bind the sandal tight and, with the side-loops drawn together, weave a curving mesh of ties up the leg. In this guise, then, she was wafted through the clear bright air, seeking the warm rising-place of the nascent sun.</p>

<span class="italic">fascia</span> (= confining band) is evidently applied here to the sole of the sandal: cf. <span class="italic">Epist.</span> VIII. 11. 3, carm. <span class="italic">v.</span> 13, <span class="italic">fasceata.</span> It cannot mean a <span class="italic">fascia pedulis,</span> which did not come near the front of the foot. The meaning is that the leather of the sole is not continued upwards over the toes to form uppers. Two thongs encircle the great toe and are passed cross-wise through large leather loops, which are attached to the sole and form a network on both sides of the foot when the laces have drawn them tight. After passing through the last pair of loops these shoe-strings were passed round the leg and fastened. The <span class="italic">vincla</span> are the laces, and 
                  <span class="italic">v.</span> 404 seems to refer to the pattern which they and the converging loops make along the instep rather than to the whole network of thongs which, as explained above, covered both sides of the foot. It is unfortunate that Sidonius uses both <span class="italic">cothurnus</span> and <span class="italic">crepida</span> for the same thing; the latter is by far the more appropriate word.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_43_1a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL296_43_2"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL296_43_2" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">2</sup>
