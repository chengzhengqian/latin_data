Wherefore I honour thee without ceasing even in my prayers, and now I acknowledge in paltry verse my great affection.</p>
<p>Whether thou dost tarry roughly garbed in a cheerless wilderness by the sun-fired Syrtes or choosest rather a marsh full of green slime or the dark recesses of rocks where deep sunless caves maintain an age-long gloom; or whether the Alps, stretching afar with their long line of precipitous crags, tremble before thee, great anchorite, as thou snatchest brief slumber on the chill ground (and with all their cold they never overcome the warm glow that Christ hath set in thy heart); for this is the way that thou art urged to go, now by Elias, now by John,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL296_251_1" id="target_note_LCL296_251_1">

<span class="italic">Montes</span> is used by ecclesiastical writers to denote bishops and priests.

Honoratus became Bp. of Aries, and Maximus (see <span class="italic">Epist.</span> VIII. 14. 2) succeeded him at Lérins and subsequently became Bp. of Riez; in each of these offices his successor was Faustus. St. Eucherius was a monk at Lérins and afterwards Bp. of Lyons. His theological writings were potent for many centuries. Hilarius was a monk of Lérins, who followed Honoratus to Aries but subsequently returned to his old monastery. He afterwards became Bp. of Aries.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL296_251_3a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
