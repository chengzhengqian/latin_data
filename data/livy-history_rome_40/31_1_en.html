<p>20. After this, the consuls brought some delegations into the senate, the first being those of the kings Eumenes, Ariarathes of Cappadocia, and Pharnaces of Pontus. The response they were given was no more than a promise that the senate would send delegates to examine and rule upon their disputes. Representatives of the Spartan exiles and the Achaeans were then shown in and the exiles were given hope that the senate would write to the Achaeans to recommend their return. The Achaeans’ account of the recovery of Messene and the settlement made there<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_447_61" id="target_note_LCL313_447_61"><sup>61</sup></a> elicited applause from the senators. Two spokesmen, Philocles and Apelles,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_447_62" id="target_note_LCL313_447_62"><sup>62</sup></a> also came from King Philip of Macedon. These were not charged with making a request of the senate, but had been sent rather to gather intelligence and make inquiries about the conversations that Perseus had accused Demetrius of holding with the Romans, and especially with Titus Quinctius—conversations relating to the throne and directed against his brother. The king had sent these two as being impartial and supporters of neither brother; but in fact they, too, were henchmen and confederates in Perseus’ schemes against his brother.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_447_63" id="target_note_LCL313_447_63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>Demetrius was aware of nothing apart from the recent furor arising from his brother’s villainy, and at first he did not entertain sanguine hopes—but he was not devoid of hope either—that his father could be reconciled with him. But then he became less and less sure every day about his father’s feelings when he saw his ears beset by his brother. He therefore watched what he said and did in order not to heighten anyone’s suspicions, and he especially avoided any mention of, or contact with, the Romans, to the point of not even wanting them to write to him, because he felt that his father was especially incensed by charges of this kind.</p>
