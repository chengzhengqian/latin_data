<p>26. At Rome, Baebius’ dispatch caused great consternation, which was made all the greater because, when Marcellus arrived in Rome a few days later, he had already turned his army over to Fabius and thus removed any hope of the army stationed in Gaul possibly being transferred to the Ligurian theater. Marcellus explained that this was because a war was going on with the Histrians, who were blocking the establishment of the colony at Aquileia; Fabius had set out for the region, he said, and could not return since hostilities had already commenced.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_463_80" id="target_note_LCL313_463_80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

They were permitted to enroll emergency troops summarily on the spot and take them with them. The praetors Quintus Petillius and Quintus Fabius were also given their orders: Petillius to enlist two emergency legions of Roman citizens and administer the military oath to all men under fifty; and Fabius to conscript 15,000 infantry and 800 cavalry from the allies and those with Latin rights. Gaius Matienus and Gaius Lucretius were elected naval duumvirs, and vessels were equipped for them.
