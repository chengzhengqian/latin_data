<p>2. It was a stormy spring that year. On the day before the Parilia,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_389_6" id="target_note_LCL313_389_6"><sup>6</sup></a> at about noon, a terrible storm with squalls arose and caused severe damage at many locations both sacred and secular. It toppled bronze statues on the Capitol; it tore a door off the temple of Luna on the Aventine, carried it along and left it lodged against the rear walls of the temple of Ceres;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_389_7" id="target_note_LCL313_389_7"><sup>7</sup></a> it overturned other statues in the Circus Maximus along with the pedestals on which they stood; and it ripped the pediments off the roofs of a number of temples and reduced them to unsightly rubble. As a result, the storm was taken as a prodigy and the <span class="italic">haruspices </span>prescribed expiatory ceremonies. Expiation was also made at this time because it had been reported that a three-footed mule had been born at Reate and, in addition, because of news from Formiae that the temple of Apollo at Caieta had been struck by lightning.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_389_8" id="target_note_LCL313_389_8"><sup>8</sup></a>As a result of these prodigies a sacrifice of twenty full-sized victims offered and there was a single day of supplication.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_389_9" id="target_note_LCL313_389_9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
