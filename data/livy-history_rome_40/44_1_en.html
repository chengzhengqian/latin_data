Valerius Antias adds the detail that they were Pythagorean and by a plausible piece of fiction lends support to the popular view that Numa had been a student of Pythagoras.</p>
<p>The books were initially read by Petillius’ friends who were on the spot. Later, as the number of readers increased and they became better known, the urban praetor Quintus Petillius, eager to study the books, borrowed them from Lucius Petillius. (In fact, the two men were acquainted because Quintus Petillius had, as quaestor, selected Lucius as a clerk on his staff.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_473_91" id="target_note_LCL313_473_91"><sup>91</sup></a>) On a general perusal of the contents, the praetor noticed a number of things tending to undermine Roman religion and he told Lucius Petillius that he intended hurling the books into a fire. He added, however, that before doing so, he was giving Lucius the opportunity to avail himself of any legal recourse or public assistance at his disposal for recovering the books, and that Petillius would not lose the praetor’s friendship by doing so. The clerk approached the plebeian tribunes and the matter was referred by the tribunes to the senate. The praetor declared that he was ready to swear that the books should not be read or preserved. The senate then voted that the praetor’s undertaking to swear to this should be deemed sufficient and that the books should be burned in the comitium at the earliest opportunity. They added that the owner should be reimbursed for them to an amount determined by the praetor Quintus Petillius and a majority of the tribunes. The clerk refused payment and the books were burned in the comitium before the eyes of the people in a fire lit by the sacrificial assistants.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_473_92" id="target_note_LCL313_473_92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
