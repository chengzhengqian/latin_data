first of all brought to Philip during his siege of Petra. Then Herodorus—Demetrius’ best friend—was thrown in prison and orders were issued for Demetrius to be kept discreetly under surveillance.</p>
<p>Coming on top of everything else, these events cast gloom over the king’s return to Macedonia. He was deeply disturbed by the latest charges but still felt that he should await the return of the men whom he had sent to Rome to make a full investigation. He had been tortured by these anxieties for some months when his delegates eventually returned, but they had earlier worked out in Macedonia the report they would make from Rome. In addition to their other nefarious acts, they also brought the king a forged letter to which was affixed a counterfeit seal of Titus Quinctius. In the letter was an appeal for Philip to condone any dealings the young man, led astray by lust for the throne, might have had with him. Demetrius, he said, would not harm any of his family members and Scipio himself was not a person who could be thought likely to support any dishonorable plan. This letter furnished confirmation for Perseus’ charges. As a result, Herodorus was immediately subjected to lengthy torture; but he died in agony without revealing anything.</p>

The escape that he had been preparing through Paeonia was used against him together with his having bribed some men to escort him on the journey; but it was the forged letter from Titus Quinctius that told against him most. However, so that he could be furtively eliminated, no harsh judgment was formally passed on him; and this was not out of consideration for Demetrius but so that his penalty would not bring to light Philip’s plans vis-à-vis the Romans.</p>
