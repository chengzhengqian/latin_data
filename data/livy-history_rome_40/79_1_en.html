Such loyalty had made Perseus—no friend of his anyway—a deadly enemy. Antigonus could foresee the danger he would face by the throne passing to Perseus as his inheritance. As soon as he perceived the king having second thoughts and sometimes lamenting the loss of the son, he would be at his side, lending an ear or even prompting him to bring up the act of folly he had committed, and would add his own laments to Philip’s. And when, as usual, the truth began to leave various traces of itself, Antigonus did all he could to accelerate full disclosure of the facts.

Leaving him to the guards, Antigonus went on ahead to Philip.</p>
