mountain Ligurians were cut down and their grain burned by Aulus Postumius until, forced by all the military defeats they had suffered, they capitulated and surrendered their arms. Postumius then advanced by ship to reconnoiter the coastline of the Ligurian Ingauni and Intemelii.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_509_136" id="target_note_LCL313_509_136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>
<p>Before these consuls reached the army that had been instructed to assemble at Pisae, it was under the command of Aulus Postumius. The brother of Quintus Fulvius, Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, who was a military tribune of the second legion, disbanded the legion during his months of command,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_509_137" id="target_note_LCL313_509_137"><sup>137</sup></a> making the centurions swear an oath to convey the moneys involved to the quaestors for deposit in the treasury.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_509_138a" id="target_note_LCL313_509_138a"><sup>138</sup></a> When news of this was brought to Aulus at Placentia—to which, by chance, he had proceeded—he set off in pursuit of the demobilized soldiers with some light horse, and those whom he was able to overtake he reprimanded and took back to Pisae; and he informed the consul about the others. On the consul’s motion, a senatorial decree was passed that Marcus Fulvius be exiled to Spain, to a point beyond New Carthage,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_509_139" id="target_note_LCL313_509_139"><sup>139</sup></a> and he was also given a letter by the consul to take to Publius Manlius in Farther Spain. The soldiers were directed to return to service. It was decreed that the legion, as a mark of disgrace, should be given only six month’s pay for that year; and in the case of any soldier failing to return to the army, the consul was ordered to sell the man himself and his possessions.</p>
