<p>10. “All right, curse the craving for royal power and rouse the spirits that pursue quarreling brothers. But so that your curses are not blindly directed, father, you must discriminate and distinguish between the plotter and the target of his plot. You must assail the guilty party. Let the one who was going to murder his brother also feel the wrath of his father’s gods; and let the one who was going to die through his brother’s heinous act find a haven in his father’s compassion and justice. For where else am I to seek refuge when I have no security at the ritual purification of your army, or in military maneuvers, or at home, or at dinner, or at night, which by nature’s gift has been granted to mortals to give them repose? If I accept the invitation and go to my brother, I must die; if I welcome my brother within my door for after-dinner drinking, I must die. Go or stay, I do not avoid the trap.</p>
<p>“Where am I to turn? Only the gods and you have I venerated, father. I do not have the Romans to turn to—they want me dead because I feel pain over your injuries, because I am angry at their taking from you all those cities and all those nations and, just recently, the coast of Thrace. While either you or I remain alive, they have no hope of Macedonia being theirs. But if <span class="italic">I</span> am eliminated by my brother’s criminal act and <span class="italic">you</span> by old age—or if they do not even wait for that—they know that the king and kingdom of Macedonia will be theirs. Had they left you with any possession outside Macedonia, I could believe that that was left as a place of refuge for me, too.</p>
<p>“But, one might say, I have enough protection in the Macedonians. You saw the soldiers’ attack on me yesterday. What did they lack but steel? And what they lacked in the daytime they took up at night as my brother’s guests.
