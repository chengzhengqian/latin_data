Why bother mentioning the majority of our leading citizens, who have placed all their hopes of advancement and prosperity in the Romans and in the man who is all-powerful with the Romans? My god, they do not just prefer that fellow to me, his elder brother, but they almost prefer him to you yourself, his king and father. It is thanks to him that the senate waived your punishment; it is he who now protects you from Roman arms and who thinks that you in your old age should be beholden and indebted to him, young as he is. The Romans are on his side; all the cities freed from your dominion are on his side; the Macedonians who are happy to have peace with Rome are on his side. Apart from you, father, what hope or protection do I have anywhere?</p>
<p>11. “What do you think is the point of that letter recently sent to you by Titus Quinctius in which he says that you looked after your own interests well in sending Demetrius to Rome, and encourages you to send him back again with a larger delegation and a number of leading Macedonian citizens?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_417_31" id="target_note_LCL313_417_31"><sup>31</sup></a> That fellow now has Titus Quinctius as his supporter in everything, and as his mentor. He has disowned you as his father and put Quinctius in your place. Most importantly, it is at Rome that their secret designs have been cooked up. Supporters for these designs are being sought when Quinctius tells you to send more representatives and some leading Macedonians with that fellow. Men go to Rome from here upright and honest, believing they have Philip as their king; they return tainted and corrupted by the seductive words of the Romans. For them Demetrius, and he alone, is everything, and they are already calling him king while his father still lives.</p>
