The other was the temple of Pietas in the vegetable market.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_485_102" id="target_note_LCL313_485_102"><sup>102</sup></a> This shrine was dedicated by the duumvir Manius Acilius Glabrio;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_485_103" id="target_note_LCL313_485_103"><sup>103</sup></a> and he erected there a gilded statue—the very first gilded statue set up in Italy<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_485_104" id="target_note_LCL313_485_104"><sup>104</sup></a>—of his father Glabrio. It was this Glabrio who had promised the temple in a vow on the day he fought the decisive engagement with King Antiochus at Thermopylae; and he had contracted out the work in accordance with a decree of the senate.</p>
<p>During the period when these temples were dedicated the proconsul Lucius Aemilius Paullus celebrated his triumph over the Ligurian Ingauni. He carried in his procession twenty-five golden crowns,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_485_105" id="target_note_LCL313_485_105"><sup>105</sup></a> but apart from that no gold or silver was borne in that triumph. Large numbers of captive Ligurian chieftains were led along before his chariot. Paullus distributed thirty asses to each of his men. To add to the glory of this triumph, Ligurian ambassadors came with a request for an abiding peace—the Ligurian people, they said, had resolved never again to take up arms except at the command of the Roman people. The reply given to the Ligurians by the praetor Quintus Fabius, who spoke to them at the behest of the senate, was that there was nothing new in the words of the Ligurians; what was now in their best interests, he said, was to adopt a fresh attitude that matched those words. He told them to approach the consuls and follow whatever orders they gave, adding that the senate would accept only the consuls’ word on whether the Ligurians were sincere in making peace. There was now peace in Liguria.</p>
