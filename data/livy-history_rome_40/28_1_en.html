<p>There were no further developments in Liguria. The Ligurians had first of all fallen back to some remote forests and then, demobilizing their army, slipped away to their villages and strongholds. The consuls also wished to demobilize their armies and they consulted the senate on the matter. The senators instructed one of them to disband his army and return to Rome to hold the election of magistrates for the coming year, and the other to winter at Pisae with his legions. There was a rumor that the Transalpine Gauls were arming men of military age, but it was not known into which part of Italy the horde would pour. The consuls accordingly arranged between them that it should be Gnaeus Baebius who would proceed to the elections because his brother Marcus Baebius was standing for the consulship.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_441_48" id="target_note_LCL313_441_48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>18. The elections for the consuls were then held, and Publius Cornelius Lentulus<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_441_49" id="target_note_LCL313_441_49"><sup>49</sup></a> and Marcus Baebius Tamphilus were appointed. The following were then elected praetors: the two Quinti Fabii, Maximus and Buteo, Tiberius Claudius Nero, Quintus Petillius Spurinus, Marcus Pinarius Rusca, and Lucius Duronius.</p>
<p> In the sortition of provinces for these men when they entered office, the Ligurians fell to the consuls. In the case of the praetors, the urban jurisdiction came to Quintus Petillius, and the foreigners’ jurisdiction to Quintus Fabius Maximus. Gaul fell to Quintus Fabius Buteo, Sicily to Tiberius Claudius Nero, Sardinia to Marcus Pinarius and Apulia to Lucius Duronius. Duronius was given the added responsibility of the Histrians because the people of Tarentum and Brundisium reported that their coastal districts had been rendered unsafe by piracy conducted by vessels from overseas.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_441_50" id="target_note_LCL313_441_50"><sup>50</sup></a> The people of Massilia lodged the same complaint about Ligurian ships.</p>
