When the praetor replied that he would, he next asked that he be permitted to fight alongside the Romans. When Gracchus also granted this request, Thurrus declared: “I shall follow you against my old allies since. . . .”<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_533_178" id="target_note_LCL313_533_178"><sup>178</sup></a> He thereafter followed the Romans and in many places provided stalwart and loyal support for Roman undertakings.</p>

After this, the famous and powerful city of Ergavica<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_533_179" id="target_note_LCL313_533_179"><sup>179</sup></a> threw open its gates to the Romans, fearful after the destruction that had befallen other peoples in the area. The surrender of these towns was not made in good faith according to some authors, who record that there was an immediate resumption of hostilities in the area from which Gracchus had withdrawn his legions, that he subsequently fought a fierce engagement with the Celtiberians at Mt. Chaunus, where a pitched battle lasted from daybreak to the sixth hour,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_533_180a" id="target_note_LCL313_533_180a"><sup>180</sup></a> and that there were many casualties on both sides. The Romans, these authors say, did not produce any other major feat to make one believe them the victors—unless one counts harassing the enemy the next day while the latter remained within their rampart. They spent the whole day gathering spoils; on the third day the two sides clashed again in a greater battle, and on that occasion the Celtiberians were at last definitively beaten, with their camp taken and plundered. Twenty-two thousand of the enemy were killed that day, with more than three hundred captured, and roughly the same number of horses, plus seventy-two military standards. With that, the war was terminated, and the Celtiberians made a true peace and not with vacillating loyalty as before.</p>
