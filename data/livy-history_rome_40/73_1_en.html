As he carried and drove off all manner of booty, whole populations were accepting his yoke, some of their own volition and others from fear; and in a matter of days he accepted the surrender of 103 towns and took possession of massive quantities of plunder. He then turned the column back toward its starting point, Alce, and proceeded to assault the town. The townspeople withstood the initial attack of their enemy but later, when they found themselves under attack from siege machinery as well as weapons, they lost confidence in their town’s defenses and all withdrew to the citadel.

Thurrus was the chief of these tribes and by far the most powerful of all the Spaniards. When he heard of the blow that had struck his family, he first sent emissaries to Gracchus to request a safe conduct to come to him in the camp and then came to him. Thurrus’ first question was whether Gracchus would spare his and his family’s lives.
