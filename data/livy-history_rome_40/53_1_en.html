without an army? If you cannot give us any assurance or guarantee about the loyalty of the barbarians and if you think an army has to be maintained there come what may, which course of action would you recommend to the senate? Sending supplementary forces to Spain so that only those soldiers whose service is complete can be demobilized and having new recruits integrated with the veterans? Or withdrawing the veteran legions from the province and raising and sending out new ones—when disdain for inexperienced recruits could incite to rebellion barbarians even less aggressive than these? Subduing a naturally fierce and recalcitrant province is easier said than done. Few cities—or so I am told—have come under our control and authority, and in their case it was mostly the proximity of our winter quarters that kept them in check. The more remote cities are up in arms. That being so, senators, I make this declaration right now.
