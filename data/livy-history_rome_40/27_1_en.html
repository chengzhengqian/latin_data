 who merely brought together his scattered army and achieved nothing else of note.</p>
<p>Such were that summer’s operations in Spain. Terentius, who had left that province, entered the city in ovation. 9,320 lbs of silver, 82 lbs of gold, and 67 golden crowns<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_439_44" id="target_note_LCL313_439_44"><sup>44</sup></a> were carried in his procession.</p>
<p>17. In the same year Roman arbitrators were on the spot to mediate a territorial dispute between the Carthaginian people and King Masinissa.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_439_45" id="target_note_LCL313_439_45"><sup>45</sup></a> Gala,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_439_46" id="target_note_LCL313_439_46"><sup>46</sup></a> father of Masinissa, had captured the land in question from the Carthaginians; Syphax had driven Gala from it and had later made a gift of it to the Carthaginians to ingratiate himself with his father-in-law Hasdrubal;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_439_47" id="target_note_LCL313_439_47"><sup>47</sup></a> and this year Masinissa had driven out the Carthaginians. The issue was debated before the Romans with a clash of wills just as ferocious as their fight on the battlefield had been. The Carthaginians kept asking for the restoration of what had belonged to their ancestors and had later come to them from Syphax. Masinissa repeatedly maintained that he had recovered territory that had belonged to his father’s realm; that his occupation of it was sanctioned by international law; and that he was the stronger claimant both in his case and by virtue of possession. In the dispute, he said, his only fear was that the decency of the Romans might do him harm—they might be afraid of appearing to have favored a king who was an ally and a friend over men who were enemies common to themselves and to him. The ambassadors made no change in the title to the land and referred the whole issue untouched to the senate in Rome.</p>
