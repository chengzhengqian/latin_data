impediments you can surmount only by shedding my blood. All your efforts and undertakings have had this aim, but so far either my vigilance or my good luck has thwarted your murderous efforts. Yesterday, at the purification ceremony, the maneuvers, and the entertainment of the mock battle you almost staged a deadly contest, and all that saved me from death was my allowing myself and my side to be defeated. From that fight between enemies you then, as if it had been a playful game between brothers, tried to lure me to dinner. Father, do you think I was going to be sitting at dinner in unarmed company when men visited me with weapons for after-dinner drinks? Do you think I would have been facing no danger from swords at night when they almost killed me with practice swords as you looked on? Why come at this time of night? Why come as an enemy to an angry man, and why accompanied by young men with swords at their sides? I did not dare entrust myself to you as a guest—was I going to welcome you for after-dinner drinking with your armed men? Had my door been open, father, you would at this time when you are hearing my complaint be instead preparing my funeral.</p>
<p>“I am not proceeding like a court prosecutor, using defamation and building a flimsy case on inference. Look: does he deny that he came to my door with a mob or that there were men with him armed with swords? Call in the men I name! The people who dared to do this can dare to do anything—but they will not dare deny this. If I were bringing them before you after they were caught carrying weapons within my threshold, you would consider it an open-and-shut case. So, since they confess to it, consider them caught red-handed!</p>
