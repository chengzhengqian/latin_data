the envoys then requested that the Roman soldiers not cross the mountains next to the camp in search of forage and wood; these were the cultivated areas of their territory, they said. When they were granted this request, the Ligurians brought together their entire army behind the very mountains from which they had kept their enemy away and, with huge numbers of men, suddenly launched an attack on the camp of the Romans, assaulting all the gates at the same time. They kept up the attack with extreme violence throughout the day, so that the Romans had not even enough time to bear out the standards or enough room to deploy their line. Packed into the gateways, they defended their camp more by obstructing the enemy than fighting them.</p>
<p>When the enemy withdrew at sunset, Paullus sent two riders to the proconsul Gnaeus Baebius at Pisae<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_461_78" id="target_note_LCL313_461_78"><sup>78</sup></a> with a letter asking him to bring aid as soon as possible since he was under siege during a time of truce. Baebius had passed his army on to the praetor Marcus Pinarius, who was then on his way to Sardinia, but he informed the senate by dispatch that Lucius Aemilius was under siege from the Ligurians. He also wrote to Marcus Claudius Marcellus, whose province<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL313_461_79" id="target_note_LCL313_461_79"><sup>79</sup></a> was closest to Aemilius, with the request that Marcellus should, if he concurred, take his army from Gaul to Liguria and free Lucius Aemilius from the siege. This assistance was going to arrive too late. The Ligurians returned to the Roman camp the following day and though Aemilius knew they would be coming, and though he could have led his men out to battle stations, he instead kept them within the rampart in order to drag out the engagement until such time as Baebius could get there with his army from Pisae.</p>
