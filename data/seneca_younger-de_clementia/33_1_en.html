of the ruler makes men shrink from doing wrong; the punishment which a kindly man decrees seems all the more severe.</p><p>You will notice, besides, that the sins repeatedly punished are the sins repeatedly committed. Your father<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_421_a" id="target_note_LCL214_421_a"><sup>a</sup></a> within five years had more men sewed up in the sack<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_421_b" id="target_note_LCL214_421_b"><sup>b</sup></a> than, by all accounts, there had been victims of the sack throughout all time. Children ventured much less often to incur the supreme sin so long as the crime lay outside the pale of the law. For by supreme wisdom the men of the highest distinction and of the deepest insight into the ways of nature chose rather to ignore the outrage as one incredible and passing the bounds of boldness, than by punishing it to point out the possibility of its being done; and so the crime of parricide began with the law against it, and punishment showed children the way to the deed; filial piety was truly at its lowest ebb after the sack became a more common sight than the cross. In that state in which men are rarely punished a sympathy for uprightness is formed, and encouragement is given to this virtue as to a common good. Let a state think itself blameless, and it will be so; its anger against those who depart from the general sobriety will be greater if it sees that they are few. Believe me, it is dangerous to show a state in how great a majority evil men are.</p><p>A proposal was once made in the senate to distinguish slaves from free men by their dress; it then became apparent how great would be the impending danger if our slaves should begin to count our number. Be sure that we have a like danger to fear if no man’s guilt is pardoned; it will soon become apparent how greatly the worse element of the state preponderates.
