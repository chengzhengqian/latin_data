<p>Such a calamity would be the destruction of the Roman peace, such a calamity will force the fortune of a mighty people to its downfall. Just so long will this people be free from that danger as it shall know how to submit to the rein; but if ever it shall tear away the rein, or shall not suffer it to be replaced if shaken loose by some mishap, then this unity and this fabric of mightiest empire will fly into many parts, and the end of this city’s rule will be one with the end of her obedience. Therefore it is not strange that kings and princes and guardians of the public order, whatever different name they bear, are held more dear even than those bound to us by private ties; for if men of sense put public interests above private, it follows that he too is dearer upon whom the whole state centres. At an earlier day, in fact, Caesar so clothed himself with the powers of state that neither one could be withdrawn without the destruction of both. For while a Caesar needs power, the state also needs a head.</p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL214_369_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL214_369_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup>Virgil, <span class="italic">Georgics</span>, iv. 212, where he is speaking of bees and their devotion to their “king.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL214_369_a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
