<p><span class="italic">Extracts from the treatise “On Mercy” preserved in a letter by Hildebert of Tours</span></p>
<p>It is the part of mercy to cause some abatement of a sentence that aims at revenge. He who does not remit the punishment of wrong-doing is a wrong-doer. It is a fault to punish a fault in full. He shows himself merciless whose might is his delight.</p>
<p>It is a shining virtue for a prince to punish less than he might. It is a virtue to be forced by necessity to take vengeance, not to visit it voluntarily. The merciful man when injured savours of something great and godlike.</p>
<p>A good prince punishes no one without being punished, proscribes no one without suffering. A good prince follows up crime, yet keeps in mind the man whom he is punishing.</p>
<p>A good prince masters himself, serves his people, esteems lightly the life-blood of no man; if it is an enemy’s, yet it is of one who may become a friend; if it is a criminal’s, yet it is a human being’s; whose-ever it may be, because he could not give it, he considers it a crime to take it away. Therefore its effusion is ever his confusion.</p></section><notes></notes></section>
