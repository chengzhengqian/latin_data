conceived the idea of king, as we may recognize from the case of bees and other creatures; the king<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_411_a" id="target_note_LCL214_411_a"><sup>a</sup></a> of the bees has the roomiest cell, placed in the central and safest spot; besides, he does no work, but superintends the work of the others, and if they lose their king, they all scatter; they never tolerate more than one at a time, and they discover the best one by means of a fight<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_411_b" id="target_note_LCL214_411_b"><sup>b</sup></a>; moreover the appearance of the king is striking and different from that of the others both in size and beauty. His greatest mark of distinction, however, lies in this: bees are most easily provoked, and, for the size of their bodies, excellent fighters, and where they wound they leave their stings; but the king himself has no sting. Nature did not wish him to be cruel or to seek a revenge that would be so costly, and so she removed his weapon, and left his anger unarmed.</p>
