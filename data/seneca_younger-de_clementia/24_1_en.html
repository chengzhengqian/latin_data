what was brought up in accusation against him—Caesar requested each man to give his verdict in writing, lest all should vote according to his lead. Then, before the tablets were opened, he solemnly declared that he would accept no bequest from Tarius, who was a rich man. Some will say, “He showed weakness in fearing that he might seem to be trying to clear the field for his own prospects by sentencing the son.” I think differently; any one of us might well have had enough faith in his own good conscience to withstand hostile criticism, but princes are bound to give much heed even to report. He solemnly declared that he would not accept a bequest. Tarius did indeed on one and the same day lose a second heir<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_403_a" id="target_note_LCL214_403_a"><sup>a</sup></a> also, but Caesar saved the integrity of his vote; and after he had proved that his severity was disinterested—for a prince should always have regard for this—he said that the son ought to be banished to whatever place the father should decide. His sentence was not the sack,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_403_b" id="target_note_LCL214_403_b"><sup>b</sup></a> nor serpents, nor prison, since his thought was not of the man on whom he was passing sentence, but of him for whom he was acting as counsellor. He said that the mildest sort of punishment ought to satisfy a father in the case of a son who was very youthful and had been moved to commit this crime, but in committing it had shown himself faint-hearted—which was next door to being innocent; therefore the son should be banished from the city and from his father’s sight. How worthy he was of being asked by parents to share their counsels! how worthy of being recorded a co-heir with the children who were innocent! This is the spirit of mercy that graces the prince; wherever he goes he should make everything more peaceable.</p></section><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL214_403_a"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL214_403_a" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">a</sup><span class="italic">i.e.</span>, Caesar as well as his son.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL214_403_a').style.display = "none";</script><li class="note" id="note_LCL214_403_b"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL214_403_b" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">b</sup>In early times the parricide was sewn into a sack with a dog, a cock, a snake, and a monkey, and drowned.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL214_403_b').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
