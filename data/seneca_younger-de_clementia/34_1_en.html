Numerous executions are not less discreditable to a prince than are numerous funerals to a physician; the more indulgent the ruler, the better he is obeyed. Man’s spirit is by nature refractory, it struggles against opposition and difficulty, and is more ready to follow than to be led; and as well-bred and high-spirited horses are better managed by a loose rein, so a voluntary uprightness follows upon mercy under its own impulse, and the state accounts it<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL214_423_a" id="target_note_LCL214_423_a"><sup>a</sup></a> worthy to be maintained for the state’s own sake.
