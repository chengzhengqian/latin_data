we tried to hold him back. But what had he to do with
Apollonia, with Dyrrachium, with Illyricum, or with the
army of the imperator Publius Vatinius?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_111_18" id="target_note_LCL507_111_18"><sup>18</sup></a> He was succeeding
Hortensius, as he said himself. Macedonia has fixed
boundaries, fixed terms of tenure, and a fixed army, if there
was any.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_111_19" id="target_note_LCL507_111_19"><sup>19</sup></a> What business did Antonius have with Illyricum
and the legions of Vatinius? “But not even Brutus had any,”
as some ill-disposed person might perhaps say. Yet all legions,<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">12</span><span class="br"></span>
all forces, wherever they are, belong to the Republic:

Brutus? The former had rushed up all of a sudden to plunder
and plague our allies in order to ravage, pillage, and
carry off everything wherever he went, and to use an army
of the Roman people against the Roman people itself; the
latter had made it his rule that wherever he had come,
some light and a hope of deliverance would seem to have
come. In a word, the former was seeking military forces in
order to overthrow the Republic, the latter to preserve it.
And we did not see this more clearly than the soldiers
themselves saw it, from whom we could not expect such
wise discrimination.</p>
