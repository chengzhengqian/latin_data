once again<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_105_5" id="target_note_LCL507_105_5"><sup>5</sup></a> as a man banished from the Republic, exposed

<p>But you, Members of the Senate, if you should desert<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">7</span><span class="br"></span>
and betray Marcus Brutus, to what citizen will you ever
show appreciation and favor? Or are you perhaps of the
opinion that those who laid a diadem upon a head<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_105_6" id="target_note_LCL507_105_6"><sup>6</sup></a> are to

the Apollinarian Games in a manner befitting his own and
the Roman people’s dignity, he did not even oversee their
celebration in person, so as not to open a path for the recklessness
of vicious criminals.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_105_8" id="target_note_LCL507_105_8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

any days ever more joyous than when the Roman people
revived the memory of Brutus with the greatest outcry
