you been of the same mind as the gentleman who calls on
you first for your view;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_101_1" id="target_note_LCL507_101_1"><sup>1</sup></a> and that there have never been so
many senators present as to provide your motion with a
single supporter? Why are you forever supporting persons
unlike yourself? Why, while your career and fortune invite
you to tranquillity and dignity, do you approve, propose,
and advocate what is contrary both to general tranquillity
and your individual dignity?</p>

<p>[2] Leaving previous matters aside, this at least I will<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">4</span><span class="br"></span>
not pass over in silence, which surprises me most of all:
what war do you have with the Bruti?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_101_2" id="target_note_LCL507_101_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Why do you alone
attack men whom all of us ought, I might almost say, to
worship? You feel no displeasure that one of them is under
siege; the other by your proposal you rob of the forces that
he has raised by his own efforts at his own risk, on his own
without assistance from any quarter, not for his own protection
but for that of the Republic. By what sentiment,
what process of thought do you disapprove of the Bruti and
approve of the Antonii, hating those whom everyone else
holds dearest, whereas those whom other people most bitterly
hate, you steadfastly esteem? You are a man of the
amplest fortune and the highest official rank; you have a
son, as I hear and hope, born for distinction; I wish him
well both for the sake of the Republic and particularly for
yours. I ask you then: would you prefer him to be like a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">5</span><span class="br"></span>
Brutus or like an Antonius (and I allow you to take your
pick among the three Antonii)? “May the gods forbid it!”
you will say. Then why do you not support and applaud
those whom you wish your son to resemble? For thus
you will be looking after the best interests of the Republic
and at the same time setting before him models for his imitation.</p>
