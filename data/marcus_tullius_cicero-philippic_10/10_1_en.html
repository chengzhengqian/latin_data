Decimus Brutus with those very veterans. And so those
most committed and vigorous champions of Caesar’s acts

the Roman people, not their own benefits, that has to be
decided by arms. Why should those who want Decimus<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">17</span><span class="br"></span>

<p>If there were anything that might seem to give us cause
to fear Marcus Brutus, would not Pansa see it; or, seeing it,
would he not be concerned? Is there a man wiser in forecasting
the future or more conscientious in warding off a

validity of Caesar’s acts, for the confirmation and ratification
of which he is about to bring a law before the centuriate

cease pretending to be afraid and to be looking out for the
Republic, or let those who fear shadows cease to be overly
timid so that the hypocrisy of the former and the cowardice
of the latter may not cause harm. Where, the devil, is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">18</span><span class="br"></span>
