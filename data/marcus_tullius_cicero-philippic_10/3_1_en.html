<p>On the following point, Quintus Fufius, I wish to remonstrate
with you, without offense to our friendship, as
one senator disagreeing with another: you said, speaking
from a written draft—for otherwise I should suppose you
made a slip because you were at a loss for a word—, that
Brutus’ letter appeared “rightly and properly” written.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_103_3" id="target_note_LCL507_103_3"><sup>3</sup></a>
That, surely, is to praise Brutus’ amanuensis, not Brutus.
By this time, Calenus, you should and can have sufficient<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">6</span><span class="br"></span>
experience of public affairs. When have you seen a decree
in this form, or in what senatorial decree of this nature—and
there are countless such—have you seen it determined
by the senate that a letter was well written? You
did not let the phrase fall by chance, as often happens: you
brought it with you, written down, prepared, pondered.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_103_4" id="target_note_LCL507_103_4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>[3] If only someone would rid you of this habit of constantly
disparaging decent men, will you not be left with all
a man could desire? So, take stock, calm this mood of yours
at some stage and soften it. Listen to decent men, with
many of whom you are on familiar terms. Speak with your
son-in-law, who is a very wise man, more often than with
yourself. Then at last you will fully possess the title of the
highest office. Does it matter nothing to you (for my part,
as a friend of yours, it often distresses me on your account)
that this is being made public knowledge and reaches the
ears of the Roman people, that nobody has supported the
senator who gave his opinion first? And I believe that this
will be the case today. You take legions from Brutus. Which
legions? Presumably those that he diverted from the criminal
enterprise of Gaius Antonius and brought over to the
Republic by his own authority. So you wish to see Brutus
