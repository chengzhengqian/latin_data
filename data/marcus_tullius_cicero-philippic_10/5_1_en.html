was there, and in that memory the likeness of Brutus was
clearly to be seen. And during those very days of the festival,
I saw Brutus on the island owned by his relative,
Marcus Lucullus, a very distinguished young man,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_107_9" id="target_note_LCL507_107_9"><sup>9</sup></a> where
he was pondering nothing except peace and civil concord.
Later, I saw him at Velia as he was leaving Italy to prevent
some occasion of civil war from arising on his account. Oh,
what a mournful sight not only for men, but even for the
very waves and beaches! That from our native land its
savior was leaving, while in that native land the betrayers
remained! Cassius’ flotilla followed a few days later; hence
I felt ashamed, Members of the Senate, to be returning to

freedom. And what a dreadful vermin he opposed! For
if Gaius Antonius had been able to accomplish what he
had in mind—as he would have been able, if the valor of
Marcus Brutus had not blocked his criminal attempt—we
would have lost Macedonia, Illyricum, and Greece.
Greece would have become a refuge for Antonius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL507_107_12" id="target_note_LCL507_107_12"><sup>12</sup></a> if
beaten, or a rampart from which to launch an attack on
Italy; the same Greece which now, not merely equipped
but even embellished with Marcus Brutus’ military command,
