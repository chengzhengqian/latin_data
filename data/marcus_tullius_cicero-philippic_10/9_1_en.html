so far from his mind that when Italy was aflame with desire
for freedom, he disappointed his countrymen’s eagerness
rather than lead them into armed conflict. Hence, even
those who censure Brutus’ tardiness, if any such there be,
admire his moderation and patience.</p>
<p>But I already see what some are saying; they make no<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">15</span><span class="br"></span>
secret of it: they profess to be afraid of how the veterans
will take it that Brutus has an army. As though there were a
difference between the armies of Aulus Hirtius, Gaius
Pansa, Decimus Brutus, and Gaius Caesar and this army of
Marcus Brutus! For if those four armies I have just mentioned
are commended for taking up arms in defense of
the freedom of the Roman people, why should this army of
Marcus Brutus not be placed in the same category? But

friend to Caesar’s cause be found than his son? And yet the
