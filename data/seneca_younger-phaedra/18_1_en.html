<p class="noindent">Queen of the forests, you who alone cherish the mountains, and alone are cherished as goddess in the lonely mountains: change these grim and threatening omens into good. O goddess, great amid the woods and groves, bright orb of heaven and splendor of night, by whose beams the world is lit alternately, three-formed Hecate: come here, favor my undertaking. Tame grim Hippolytus’ unbending spirit. Let him listen to me obligingly; soften his wild heart; let him learn to love, and feel shared flames of passion. Bind fast his mind; grim, hostile, fierce as he is, let him acknowledge Venus’ laws. Direct your power here: so may you fare bright-faced, and travel through rifted clouds with horns undimmed; so, as you guide the reins of the nighttime sky, may Thessalian chants never have power to drag you down, and may no herdsman win glory over you.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_453_22" id="target_note_LCL062_453_22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Come to my appeal, now favor my prayers, goddess. I see the very man worshipping at the customary shrine, no companion at his side. Why hesitate? Chance has provided time and place: I must use my skills. Trembling? It is not easy to venture on crime under orders; but one subject to royalty must put aside the right, and drive honor completely from the mind. Shame is a poor servant of royal authority.</p>
