the lake that none can recross, recruited by an audacious suitor to carry away one torn from the throne of the underworld’s king!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_427_5" id="target_note_LCL062_427_5"><sup>5</sup></a> He presses on as the ally of madness, no fear or shame held him back; illicit, adulterous sex is sought in the depths of Acheron by Hippolytus’ father.</p>
<p>But another, greater pain weighs on my distress. No nightly rest, no deep sleep releases me from my cares. My trouble feeds and grows and burns within me, like the heat that pours from Etna’s cavern. Pallas’ loom is idle, and the wool slips from between my hands.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_427_6" id="target_note_LCL062_427_6"><sup>6</sup></a> I have no desire to honor the temples with votive offerings, nor to join the choruses of Athenian women amid the altars and whirl torches in witness of the silent rites, nor to approach with chaste prayers and devout rituals the goddess who guards the land adjudicated as hers.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_427_7" id="target_note_LCL062_427_7"><sup>7</sup></a> My pleasure lies in starting and pursuing beasts in the chase, and in hurling stiff javelins with my soft hand.</p>
<p>What course is this, my spirit? What is this crazy love of the woodland? I recognize my poor mother’s fateful evil; our love is experienced at sinning in the forests. Mother, I pity you. You were seized by unspeakable evil, an audacious love for the wild leader of fierce cattle. A brute lecherer, impatient of the yoke, was that leader of the untamed herd—yet he loved <span class="italic">something</span>!<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_427_8" id="target_note_LCL062_427_8"><sup>8</sup></a> What god or what Daedalus could assist <span class="italic">my</span> unhappy flames of passion?
