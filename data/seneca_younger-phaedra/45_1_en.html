speeding team: now he curbs and drags on their mouths with reins tight, now he controls their backs with repeated use of the coiling whip. He is followed by a constant companion, now keeping equal pace, now whirling around to meet them head-on, bringing terror from every side. Further flight is impossible, for head-on, full in their path, there charges the terrible horned sea creature. Then indeed the steeds, crazed with fear, reject control and struggle to tear themselves from the yoke; as they rear up, they jettison their burden.</p>
<p>Flung headlong on his face, he catches his body as he falls in a tangling snare. The more he fights, the more he tightens the clinging knots. The beasts sense their misdeed, and with the chariot lightened and no one ruling them, they rush wherever fear bids. Just so in the sky a team, not recognizing its proper burden and indignant that daylight was entrusted to a false Sun, tossed the straying Phaethon out of the heavens. Far and wide he bloodies the countryside; his head smashes against boulders and snaps back; brambles tear away his hair; hard stones ravage his handsome face, and his ill-fated beauty is destroyed by many wounds. The swift wheels roll his dying limbs over and over. At last, as he is dragged along, a tree trunk, charred into a stake, grips him with its stock thrust out, right through his groin. The team stops a moment, with its master impaled; the wound halts the yoked pair. Then they break the delay and with it their master. Now, barely alive, he is cut by the undergrowth of thornbushes bristling with sharp brambles, and every tree trunk takes part of his body.</p>
