(<span class="italic">to Phaedra</span>) Look, am I suited to adulteries? Did I of all men seem to you ready material for such a crime? Did my sternness earn this? Oh, you surpass all womankind in crime, you have dared a mightier evil than your monster-bearing mother, you are worse than your parent! She defiled only herself with adultery, and yet her long-concealed guilt was revealed by the damning evidence of her two-formed offspring; the mongrel infant with its bestial face proved the motherâ€™s iniquity. That was the womb that bore you! O thrice and four times blessed in their fate were those consumed, destroyed and done to death by hatred or treachery! Father, I envy you: this is an evil worse, worse than your Colchian stepmother.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_475_31" id="target_note_LCL062_475_31"><sup>31</sup></a></p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">phaedra</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">I too recognize the fate of my family: we seek what should be shunned.

What is this? Even throwing herself into an embrace? Out, sword, exact the penalty she deserves. See, my left hand has twisted her hair and bent her wanton head back. Never was blood offered more justly at your altar, goddess of the bow.</p></div><notes><section class="footnotes"><ul><li class="note" id="note_LCL062_475_31"><a class="footnoteCrossrefLink" href="#target_note_LCL062_475_31" title="Click to highlight in text"><sup class="lineRef">31</sup>Medea, who had attempted to kill Theseus by poison.</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL062_475_31').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
