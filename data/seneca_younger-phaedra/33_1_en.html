<span class="line indent2">the orb born after the old Arcadians</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">will be helpless to guide her shining horses.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Just lately she blushed, and there was no dingy</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">cloud obstructing her bright face.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">We, alarmed at the deity’s gloom,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">thinking her tugged by Thessalian spells,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">made jangling noises;<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_483_35" id="target_note_LCL062_483_35"><sup>35</sup></a> but <span class="italic">you</span> had caused</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">Let frosts more seldom harm this face,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">How attractive a face of flinty manhood</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and the somber frown of an older sternness!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Your gleaming neck could vie with Phoebus’.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">A full head of hair shades and adorns him,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">shorter hair that covers the brow suits you,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
