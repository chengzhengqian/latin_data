<span class="line indent2">dams seek out forage at night;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">you, where exposure to warm south winds</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">softens the frosts for the rugged Acharnian.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Let one man tread the crags of sweet</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Hymettus, another the plain of Aphidnae.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">That region has long been lying untouched</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">where Sunion</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">pushes back the edge of the curving sea.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Phyle calls</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">to anyone roused by woodland glory:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">here stirs the dread of farmers, a boar</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">famed by now for many a wound.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p><p class="lineGroup">
<span class="line indent2">Now you men, give</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">free rein to the hounds that hunt in silence.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The keen Molossians should be kept on the leash,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and the quarrelsome Cretans should strain at the sturdy</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">chains abrading the coat on their necks.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">But the Spartan houndsâ€”</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the breed is fearless and avid for the prey,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">so fasten them carefully with a closer knot.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">The time will come</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">when the hollow rocks can ring with their barking;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">now with heads lowered</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">they must sniff out the scent with their keen nostrils,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">search the coverts with muzzles down,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">while the light is dim,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">while the dewy ground holds the marks of feet</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">imprinted on it.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
