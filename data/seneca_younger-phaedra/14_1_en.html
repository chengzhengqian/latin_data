<span class="line indent2">Fire touched the bright goddess of the darkened sky;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">she forsook the night and entrusted her brother</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">with the different driving of her shining chariot.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">He learned to guide the two-horse team</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of night, and wheel in a tighter circuit.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">But the nights did not keep their proper hours,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and day returned in a tardy dawn</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">as the burdened chariot’s axle trembled.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Alcmene’s son set aside his quiver</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and the threatening spoil from the awesome lion,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">allowing his fingers to be fitted with emeralds</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and his rough hair to be brought to order.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">He bound his legs with studded gold,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">while yellow slippers confined his feet;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and the hand that had just now borne the club</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">drew out threads with the hurrying spindle.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">Persia was witness</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">and Lydia fertile in rich sand</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">as he cast aside the fierce lion’s pelt,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">&lt;and took on those thews&gt; and shoulders, on which</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">the palace of lofty heaven had rested,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">a delicate robe of Tyrian thread.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

A lively anonymous  version of 300ff. appeared in 1557: “And oft eke him that doth the heavens guide / Hath love transformed to shapes for him too base. / Transmuted thus sometime a swan is he, / Leda [to entice] and eft Europe to please; / A mild white bull, with wrinkled front and face, / Suffereth her play till on his back leaps she, / Whom in great care he ferryeth through the seas.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL062_445_17a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
