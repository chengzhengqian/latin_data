<span class="line indent2">Go, surround the shady forests</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and high mountain ridges of Cecrops’ land!</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Roam widely on swift feet, and range</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the lands that lie below the crags</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">of Mt. Parnethus</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and the lands that the river in Thria’s vale</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">buffets as it rushes with its whirling current;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">climb the hills</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">always white with Riphaean snow.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Other men, go here</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">where lofty alders weave a grove,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">where meadows lie</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">caressed by the Zephyr’s dewy breeze</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">inviting the growth of springtime grasses,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and where through thin-soiled</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">fields the slight Ilisos glides</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">sluggishly, and scrapes</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">the barren sands with its grudging stream.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">You men, go by the left-hand path</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">where Marathon opens its glades,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">where in the company of their small brood</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
