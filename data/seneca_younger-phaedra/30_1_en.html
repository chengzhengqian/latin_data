<p class="noindent">Her guilt has been exposed. Why idle and dazed, my spirit? We must deflect the blame back on him, and actually accuse <span class="italic">him</span> of unnatural lust. Crime must be masked by crime. When afraid, it is safest to attack. What witness will know if we first dared the outrage or suffered it, since it happened in secret?</p>

(<span class="italic">enter citizens and servants</span>) See, he has dashed away and left his sword here in the confusion of his panic flight. We have the proof of the crime. First comfort <span class="italic">her</span> in her distress. Let her hair stay pulled and torn as it is, as evidence of such wrongdoing. Take word to the city. Recover your senses, mistress! Why do you gash yourself and shun everyone’s gaze? It is the mind that makes a woman unchaste, not what befalls her.</p>
