<span class="line indent5">Heaven-sent is that fire (believe its victims)</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">and all too powerful.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">Where the earth is girdled by the deep salt sea</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">and where the bright stars run their courses</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">through the very heavens,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">the implacable boy holds sovereignty.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">In the watery depths his arrows are felt</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">by the sea-blue throng of Nereids,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">who cannot allay those flames with the sea.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">His fires are felt by winged creatures.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">Roused by Venus, a bullock boldly</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">undertakes war for the whole herd.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">If they fear the loss of their mates,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">timid stags issue challenges to battle,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">and with their roaring</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">they signal the madness engendered in them.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">At that time swarthy India dreads</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">the banded tigers;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">the boar sharpens his wounding tusks</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">at that time, with foam covering his muzzle;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">Carthaginian lions shake their manes</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">when love has moved them;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">then the woods echo with savage growls.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">The leviathan of the maddened seas feels love,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">the elephant too.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent5">Nature asserts her power over all.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">Nothing is immune,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">and hatred vanishes when love commands;</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">inveterate anger yields to that fire.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">To cap my theme:</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent4">love-cares conquer stepmothersâ€™ cruelty.</span><span class="linebreak"></span></p></div><notes></notes></section>
