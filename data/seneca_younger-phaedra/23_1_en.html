There was no light javelin armed with slender iron, no long-bladed sword to gird one’s side, no helmets with crests gleaming afar; wrath made its own weapons. The spirit of war created new arts, and a thousand forms of death. Hence bloodshed stained every land, and reddened the sea. Then, with restraints gone, crimes went through each home, and no outrage was unexampled: brothers fell to brothers, fathers at their sons’ hands, husbands lie dead by their wives’ swords, and unnatural mothers destroy their own offspring. I say nothing of stepmothers: not one of them is more merciful than wild beasts. But the leader in evil is woman. This artificer of crimes besets our minds; through this unchaste creature’s adulteries so many cities smolder, so many nations wage war, and so many peoples are crushed in the utter overthrow of kingdoms. To say nothing of others, Aegeus’ wife Medea alone will reveal women as a monstrous tribe.</p>
