<span class="line indent2">The wound he gives has no broad surface,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">but eats deep into the hidden marrow.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">No peace for your boy: throughout the world</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">he spryly showers and scatters his arrows.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">All regions that see the sun being born,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">all regions that lie near his western goal,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">any placed beneath the blazing Crab,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">any frozen beneath the Parrhasian Bear</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">ferocious flames, and in tired old men</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">he wakes again the extinguished warmth,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">strikes maidens’ hearts with unknown fire—</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and bids the gods abandon heaven</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and dwell with features disguised on earth.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent3">Phoebus as master of a herd in Thessaly</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">drove cattle; setting aside his lyre</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">he called the bulls with a slanting reed pipe.</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">Even he who guides the clouds and heavens</span><span class="linebreak"></span>

<span class="line indent2">grim-faced now as a boisterous bull</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">he lowered his back for playful maidens,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">and through a new realm, his brother’s waves,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">as his hooves played the role of pliant oars,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
<span class="line indent2">he breasted and overcame the deep,</span><span class="linebreak"></span>
