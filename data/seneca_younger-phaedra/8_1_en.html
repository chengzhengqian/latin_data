My spirit goes knowingly into the abyss, and turns back ineffectively in search of sane judgment. So, when a sailor drives a laden vessel against the current, his efforts go to waste, and the overpowered ship is carried away by the headlong flow. What could reason do? Madness has conquered and rules me, and a mighty god controls my whole mind. This winged one has uncurbed power in every land, and with his unbridled flames he fires Jove himself. Warlike Gradivus has felt those firebrands; the craftsman god of the three-forked lightning<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_433_11" id="target_note_LCL062_433_11"><sup>11</sup></a> has felt them—the one who quickens the furnaces ever raging in Etna’s peak grows hot with so small a fire. Even Phoebus, who aims arrows true from his bow, was shot more unerringly with a shaft fired by that boy, who flies about oppressing heaven and earth alike.</p></div><div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">nurse</span></span><blockquote><p>
<p class="noindent">The story that love is a god was invented by base lust, in the interests of its own depravity; to have greater scope, it gave its mad passion the pretext of a false divinity. Of <span class="italic">course</span> the goddess of Eryx sends her son wandering through the whole earth; he flies through the sky wielding wanton weapons in his tender hand, and holds such great sway as the smallest of the gods! It was a crazy spirit that adopted this fiction, and invented Venus’ divinity and the god’s bow.</p>
