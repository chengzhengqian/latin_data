 communities<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_431_9" id="target_note_LCL062_431_9"><sup>9</sup></a>—your father? Will he let such a deed lie unconcealed? Parents’ care is shrewd. But suppose we conceal such an outrage by cunning and deceit: what of him who pours his light on the world, your mother’s father? What of him who shakes the heavens, brandishing the bolt from Etna in his glittering hand, procreator of the gods? Do you suppose it can be managed that between these all-seeing grandfathers you will not be seen? But imagine this wicked coupling is concealed by the gods’ kindly support, imagine your debauchery meets with the loyalty that is always withheld from great crimes: what of the ever present punishment—the mind’s fearful conscience, the spirit full of guilt and afraid of itself? Some women have transgressed with safety, but none with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Check these flames of unnatural love, I pray you, this evil that no barbarian land has ever committed—not the Getae wandering on their plains nor the inhospitable Taurians nor the scattered Scythians. Banish this terrible deed from your chaste mind; with memories of your mother, shrink from unheard-of sexual union. Are you planning to confound the beds of father and son, to hold a progeny of confusion in an unnatural womb? Go on, overturn nature with your wicked fires! Why have monsters ceased? Why is your brother’s hall empty?<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_431_10" id="target_note_LCL062_431_10"><sup>10</sup></a> Shall the world always hear of strange portents, shall nature always abandon her laws, when a Cretan woman loves?</p>
