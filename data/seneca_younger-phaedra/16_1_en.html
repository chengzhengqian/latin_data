<p class="noindent">Nurse, tell us your news. What is the queen’s situation? Is there any moderation of the cruel flames?</p>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker"><span class="sc">nurse</span></span><blockquote><p>
<p class="noindent">No hope exists that such an affliction can be eased; there will be no end to the flames of insanity. The fever silently burns her, and her inner madness, however much concealed, is betrayed in her face. Fire bursts forth through her eyes; her weary sight cannot bear the daylight. Nothing pleases her fickle mind for long, and her restless pain disturbs her body in various ways: now she flags and collapses as if her legs have given way, and can hardly support her head on her drooping neck; now she prepares to rest, but forgets sleep and spends the night in laments. She bids them raise her body and lay it down again, unfasten her hair and arrange it once more; her condition is always impatient with itself and changing. No thought of food or health now occurs to her. Her feet falter as her strength fails; there is not that same vigor, not the ruddiness that colored her glowing face,<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL062_449_18" id="target_note_LCL062_449_18"><sup>18</sup></a> and those eyes that once betokened Phoebus’ torch have none of that inherited ancestral brilliance. Tears fall across her face, her eyes are flooded with constant moisture, as on the ridges of Taurus the snows melt when struck by warm rain showers.</p>
