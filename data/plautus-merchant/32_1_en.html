bought a mistress behind my wife’s back and behind my
son’s back. It’s decided: I’ll follow my old ways again and
be at my own service. Now only a brief span of life is left:
I’ll enjoy myself with pleasure, wine, and love. Yes, it’s
much fairer that people of <span class="italic">my</span> age should have a good
time. When you’re young, when your blood is fresh, you<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">550</span><span class="br"></span>
ought to look after making your fortune. Then at last,
when you’re an old man, you should devote yourself to
leisure and you should love as long as you can: being alive
is already gain. As I say this, I’m following it through with
actions. Still, in the meantime I’ll now have a look here at<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">555</span><span class="br"></span>
home at my place. My wife has been expecting me at
home for a while, hungry. Now she’ll kill me with her
nagging if I go back in. But in the end, however that may
be, I won’t go in yet; instead I’ll meet this neighbor of
mine before returning home. I want him to rent some<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">560</span><span class="br"></span>
house for me where that woman can live. And look, he’s
coming out.</p><span class="stage"><span class="italic">Enter LYSIMACHUS from his house.</span></span></div>
