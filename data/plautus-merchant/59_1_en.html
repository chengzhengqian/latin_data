leave, the law they should follow and be content with. If
we find out that any sixty-year-old, married or unmarried,
whores around, we shall deal with him according to
the following law: we shall consider him ignorant, and as<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1020</span><span class="br"></span>
far as we’re concerned when he wastes his possessions he
shall reduce himself to poverty. And from now on let no
one prevent his young son from being in love and hiring a
prostitute, so long as it happens in moderation; if anyone
prevents it, he shall lose more behind his back than if he
had given it openly. This law shall apply to old men from
tonight onward. Farewell. And, young men, if you like<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">1025</span><span class="br"></span>
this law, it’s only fair for you to give us the loud applause
that the old men have earned.</p></div>
