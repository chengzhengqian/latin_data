himself wants; all I ask you two is that you make peace
between us, so that he isn’t angry with me. If I’d known
or if he’d told me merely in jest that he was in love with
her, I would never have taken her away from her lover.
Eutychus, you are his comrade: I ask you, save and help<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">995</span><span class="br"></span>
me. (<span class="italic">pointing to himself</span>) Make this old man your client;
you’ll have occasion to say that he hasn’t forgotten your
kindness.</p></div>

laying into me full of arrogance. I hope I too will have an

there.</p></div>

about this.</p></div>

the streets are witnesses to your deeds while we’re recounting
