or has perpetual problems in greater number. Can’t anything
that I’ve begun to do turn out to my lasting advantage,
as I desire? No, some misfortune is thrown my way
which botches my good plan. Poor me, I bought myself a<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">340</span><span class="br"></span>
girlfriend, for my enjoyment, and rescued her for a price,
believing that I could keep this secret from my father; he

house against my will long ago and told me to go and be a
merchant; there I found this trouble. What pleasure is
there in a situation where grief has the upper hand over
joy? In vain did I conceal her, hide her, keep her out of<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">360</span><span class="br"></span>

him, and there’s nothing so sacred or profane that he
wouldn’t be on the spot immediately. I don’t have any
