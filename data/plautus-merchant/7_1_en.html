until he’d got the possessions he had then. I
ought to do the same if I were the way I ought to be.
When I realized that I was a nuisance to my father and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">80</span><span class="br"></span>
hated by the man I should please, I gave myself a push
and made up my mind, despite being madly in love. I said
I was going to be a merchant if he so wished; I’d let go of
my love so long as I could obey him. He thanked me and<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">85</span><span class="br"></span>
