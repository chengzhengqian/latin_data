off, I think my head would be on fire already. I have hope,

know. If my father seizes the opportunity to do what he
said, my salvation has gone into exile; but if my comrade
has done what he promised, my salvation hasn’t gone.
But even if Eutychus had gouty feet, he could have returned<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">595</span><span class="br"></span>

for bringing me this hoped-for hope.] The fact that he’s
standing there now—oh no, I’m dead! I don’t like his face
at all. He’s walking along looking depressed (my breast is<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">600</span><span class="br"></span>
on fire, I’m stuck), he’s shaking his head. Eutychus!</p></div>
