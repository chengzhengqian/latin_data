law than men: if a man hires a prostitute behind his wife’s
back and the wife finds out about it, the husband goes unpunished.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">820</span><span class="br"></span>
If a wife leaves the house behind her husband’s
back, the man thereby gets grounds to throw her out of
the marriage. Would that there was the same law for the
husband as for the wife: a wife who is good is content with
a single husband. Why should a husband be any less content<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">825</span><span class="br"></span>
with a single wife? If husbands were to be punished
in the same way if one hires a prostitute behind his wife’s
back just as guilty women are thrown out, I’d bet there
would now be more divorced men than women.</p></div>
