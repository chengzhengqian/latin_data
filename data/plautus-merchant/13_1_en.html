you, why didn’t you guard against him seeing her, you
thug? You criminal, why didn’t you hide her away so that<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">190</span><span class="br"></span>
my father wouldn’t spot her?</p></div>
<div class="sp"><span class="speaker sc"><span class="inline">acan</span></span><p class="lineGroup noindent">Because we were busy with our own business: we were

While this was going on, your father came round in a tiny
boat, and no one spotted him until he went onto the ship.</p></div>
