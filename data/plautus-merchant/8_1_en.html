day I approached my host and asked him to sell her to
me. I said I’d be grateful and obliged for his kindness.<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">105</span><span class="br"></span>
What need is there for words? I bought her from him and
brought her here yesterday. I don’t want my father to find
out that I brought her here. Just now I left her and my
slave at the harbor on the ship. (<span class="italic">looking around</span>) But why
do I see my slave running from the harbor? I forbade him<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">110</span><span class="br"></span>
to leave the ship. I’m afraid of what this may mean.</p><span class="stage"><span class="italic">Enter ACANTHIO from the left, in such a hurry that he does

have your young master saved through your effort: go on,
Acanthio, drive your exhaustion away from you, make
sure that you don’t devote yourself to your sloth instead
of more important things. At the same time that my difficulty

shortness of breath), the people coming toward me on<span class="br"></span><span class="lineNumber">115</span><span class="br"></span>
the overcrowded pavements are killing me. Drive them
away, push them down, throw them down into the street.
Their conduct here is appalling: no one thinks it proper
to give way to someone who is running and rushing. You
have to do three things at the same time when you begin
one: you have to run, you have to fight, and you have to
quarrel in the street.</p></div>
