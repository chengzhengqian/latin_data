and were, for that reason, assigned to the rearmost line.</p>
<p>When an army had been marshalled in this fashion, the <span class="italic">hastati</span> were the first of all to engage. If the <span class="italic">hastati</span> were unable to defeat the enemy, they retreated slowly and were received into the intervals between the companies of the <span class="italic">principes</span>. The <span class="italic">principes</span> then took up the fighting and the <span class="italic">hastati</span> followed them. The <span class="italic">triarii</span> knelt beneath their banners, with the left leg advanced, having their shields leaning against their shoulders and their spears thrust into the ground and pointing obliquely upwards, as if their battle-line were fortified with a bristling palisade. If the <span class="italic">principes</span>, too, were unsuccessful in their fight, they fell back slowly from the battle-line on the <span class="italic">triarii</span>. (From this arose the adage, “to have come to the <span class="italic">triarii,</span>” when things are going badly.) The <span class="italic">triarii,</span> rising up after they had received the <span class="italic">principes</span> and <span class="italic">hastati</span> into the intervals between their companies, would at once draw their companies together and close the lanes, as it were; then, with no more reserves behind to count on, they would charge the enemy in one compact array. This was a thing exeedingly disheartening to the enemy, who, pursuing those whom they supposed they had conquered, all at once beheld a new line rising up, with augmented numbers. There were customarily four legions raised of five thousand foot each, with three hundred horse to every legion.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_33_1a" id="target_note_LCL191_33_1a"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

Quart.</span> 12 (1918) 9–14). The writer concludes that “in the army which Livy was describing there were only 10 maniples of Hastati, 10 of Principes, and 10 <span class="italic">ordines</span> of the third division (Triarii + Rorarii + Accensi). Then the numeration becomes clear; the third division has 3 times 600, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> 1800; each of the first two has 1600, each maniple running to 160. This gives 1800+2(1600)=5000, Livy’s total.”</a></li><script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById('note_LCL191_33_1a').style.display = "none";</script></ul></section></notes></section>
