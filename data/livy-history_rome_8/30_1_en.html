Gauls, a race of savages.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_61_1" id="target_note_LCL191_61_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The rest of the Latin  <span class="marginNote right"><span class="sc">b.c.</span> 338</span>peoples were deprived of the rights of mutual trade and intermarriage and of holding common councils. The Campanians, out of compliment to their knights, because they had not consented to revolt along with the Latins, were granted citizenship without the suffrage; so too were the Fundani and Formiani, because they had always afforded a safe and peaceful passage through their territories. It was voted to give the people of Cumae and Suessula the same rights and the same terms as the Capuans. The ships of the Antiates were some of them laid up in the Roman dockyards, and some were burnt and a motion passed to employ their beaks for the adornment of a platform erected in the Forum. This place was dedicated with augural ceremonies and given the name of Rostra or The Beaks.<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_61_2" id="target_note_LCL191_61_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

The Aurunci had surrendered in the consulship of Titus Manlius<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_61_3" id="target_note_LCL191_61_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and had given no trouble since that time, for which reason they had the better right to expect assistance from the Romans. But before the consuls marched from Rome—for the Senate had directed them to defend the Aurunci—tidings were brought that the Aurunci had abandoned their town, in their alarm, and had taken refuge, with their wives and children, in Suessa—now called Aurunca<a class="footnoteLink" href="#note_LCL191_61_4" id="target_note_LCL191_61_4"><sup>4</sup></a>—which they had fortified: and that their ancient walls and their city had been destroyed by the Sidicini.
